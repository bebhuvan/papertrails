      "content": "The world is drowning in plastic. This much we know. It seems that every day greets us with fresh evidence that there is no escaping the plastic prison humanity has built for itself. In the final summation, plastic, for all its uses and abuses, is a pollutant. But there are some who believe that we can repair the damage that plastics have wrought. After all, the thinking goes, humans have successfully deployed science and policy action to reverse harms caused by other pollutants—chlorofluorocarbons chewing holes in the ozone and leaded gasoline damaging young brains, for example. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Philip Landrigan, director of Boston College’s Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good and of its Global Observatory on Planetary Health, is one such optimist. He and colleagues from universities and non-profits across the globe launched a monitoring effort this week to track not only the extent of the plastic pollution problem but also the emerging research on the effects of all this plastic on human and environmental health. Writing inThe Lancet, Landrigan and his co-authors announced the launch of the Lancet Countdown on health and plastics, noting the effort will deliver regular reports and encourage original research. “Continued worsening of plastics-associated harms is not inevitable,” they wrote in a report announcing the launch of the project in The Lancet.The statistics they gather are striking. Global plastic output has exploded, increasing more than 250-fold in the past 72 years. “Without intervention,” Landrigan and his co-authors write, “it is projected that global plastic production will nearly triple by 2060.” Less than 10 percent of plastic used today is recycled, and 80 percent by weight of all plastic ever made is still present in the environment. The manufacture, use, and pollution of this plastic currently costs the world at least $1.5 trillion per year in health-related economic losses, and as much as 20 percent of all fossil fuels are expected to be used in plastic manufacture by 2050.Nautilus spoke to Landrigan about the difference between necessary and unnecessary plastic, the petrochemical industry’s pivot from fossil fuel to plastic production, and the perils of magical thinking.

PLASTIC CRUSADER: Philip Landrigan of Boston College will co-chair the Lancet Countdown on health and plastics, a monitoring effort that will track global plastic exposures and harms to human and planetary health. Photo courtesy of Boston College.As you and your co-authors poured through thousands of reports and pieces of literature, what surprised you the most?First and foremost, the sheer scale of the problem. I’ve been studying pollution since 2015 and chemical and plastic pollution since maybe 2018, and we’ve known it was out there. But it really was not until we got deep into this literature that we realized just how enormous the problem is. The numbers are just staggering. And the number that really blew me away was the economic number [$1.5 trillion in health-related economic losses due to plastic production and pollution] that our colleague Maureen Cropper and her team generated.We’re gathering all this data that micro- and nano-plastic particles (MNPs) are in every tissue of the human body, at the top of Mount Everest, in the bottom of the Marianas Trench—everywhere. But we seem to have very little solid evidence for direct health effects from them. I think the science has yet to catch up. What kind of physiological harm to human health from these MNPs is most directly supported by the evidence? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . That’s exactly right. We know much more about the chemicals, or at least about a subset of the chemicals, in plastics than we do about those particles.I would say the best evidence so far is the study that came out in March of 2024, in the New England Journal of Medicine from a group of cardiologists in Naples, Italy. They took atherosclerotic plaque tissue that had been removed from the carotid arteries of patients. They looked for the presence of micro- and nano-plastic particles, and they found MNPs in about 60 percent of the patients. And then they tracked the patients over the next three years, and they found that the patients who had MNPs in their plaque were 4.5 times more likely to have a heart attack, a stroke, or to die over that time, as compared to the people in the population who did not have visible plastics in their plaque. Of course, it’s only one study. But a 4.5-fold—which is to say a 450 percent—increase in risk is really quite astonishing. Even though it’s only a single study, it has to be taken seriously. And it’s a finding that calls out urgently to be followed up.As an individual, as a consumer, how would you suggest thinking about the perceived dangers of MNPS, and living your life in a world that’s filled with plastic?I say to people, “Listen, you’re not going to be able to avoid plastics entirely in today’s world.” They’re too ubiquitous. And besides, many of the plastics that are out there really are necessary. There is no good substitute for them. Speaking as a recovering medical practitioner, I couldn’t have practiced pediatrics without IV tubing, without endoscopes, without laryngoscopes. I try to reassure people that they can’t completely avoid plastics, but that they can use their intelligence to distinguish the plastics that are unavoidable from those that can quite easily be avoided. And in medicine, for example, we have to go with those instruments that I just mentioned. But we certainly don’t need plastic sheets on beds. We don’t need plastic gowns on people, except under unusual circumstances. We don’t need three layers of plastic wrapping on a suture kit where we put in one or two stitches in the emergency room. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . This distinction between the necessary and the unnecessary plastics is borne out in the macro statistics. Something like 40 percent of all plastic currently being made is single-use plastic—stuff that’s made to be used once and tossed.The very rapid growth of that sector of plastic manufacturing reflects a deliberate strategy by the vertically integrated industry that produces plastic to pivot away from producing fossil fuels to making plastics.“Listen, you’re not going to be able to avoid plastics entirely in today’s world.”That was one of the interesting things that I read in the report—the plans by the Saudi Arabian Oil company and Shell to divert so much of their production toward plastic in the future. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Shell has just completed construction of a huge facility in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, which is out just west of Pittsburgh. The price tag I heard was $6 billion, and the purpose is to take fracked gas from Appalachia and turn it into plastic nurdles, which are basically the building blocks of plastic, which can then be shipped elsewhere to be fabricated into products.That really tells you that it’s going to be hard, to say the least, to stem the tide of plastics going into the future. Do you have real hope that we can not only do that, but also understand its effects on both the environment and on human health—that we can really make a difference going into the next 20, 30, 50, years?You know, despite all the opposition that’s out there, I’m fundamentally an optimist. I’m not sure that the right treaty is going to come out of the current negotiations. Whether we get the treaty that we need to protect human health between now and August 14, I have no doubt that global society will come to grips with the plastics problem over the next few years. Because the evidence and the outrage are just mounting so rapidly that the petrol companies won’t be able to have their will. It was this bad in the 1990s. When people talked about climate, people said it could never be done. And yet we got the Paris Agreement. Now, I understand it’s not perfect: Trump has walked away from it. Other countries are following suit. And yet we are making progress. The greenhouse gas emissions are still going up, but the rate of increase has slowed as more and more green energy comes on line. I don’t know that the details will be at all the same, but I think we’ll see a similar reversal of trends in the case of plastics. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . One thing that people are starting to talk about is reconfiguring the treaty process. If the UN negotiations break down yet again, because a small number of nations can thwart the will of the majority, perhaps it’s going to become necessary to take the treaty negotiations out of the UN and do them independently, under the sponsorship of one or more countries, like the EU or Canada. This is exactly the model that was followed a decade or so ago with the landmine treaty. When the UN negotiations broke down, Canada picked up the pieces, brought a number of nations together, and in the span of two or three weeks hammered out the treaty.In the report you talk about air pollution, the pervasiveness of lead in several different products, the ozone depleting chemicals, etc. To me, those were in a way more tractable environmental problems. We knew that we were putting these accelerants, for example, in aerosol products, and we knew that if we took them out, there would probably be a benefit. And we were right.As a young doc at [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] in the 1970s, I was very much involved in the work that led up to the removal of lead from gasoline. You’re right. It was one chemical, one source. But here, there’s also only one root source. It’s the petrochemical industry and their products. There are thousands of different products, to be sure, but there’s one root source, and I do think that ultimately, it’s tractable for that reason.And we know how to do it. We’ve done it successfully for air pollution, for lead, for chlorofluorocarbons. We’re doing it now for mercury. And the playbook is pretty much the same in every case: You get an agreement, you hammer out regulations, you enforce, you penalize those who violate the regulations, and you incentivize people who are doing the right thing. It ultimately works. It just takes time. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Is there anything in your mind that differentiates the problem with plastic pollution and these other problems, such as lead or ozone depleting chemicals?Number one, it’s certainly chemically far more complex. Number two, the plastics are going to be with us for a long time. Even if we were to stop production totally today—which, of course, is not going to happen—there are 8 billion tons of plastic waste, large and small, circulating in the biosphere. That stuff’s going to be there for a long time to come. Whereas the chlorofluorocarbons dissipated, the lead dissipated, air pollution cleaned up quite rapidly, this job is going to be with us for a long time. But if we get it right, we can reduce the pumping out of new plastic into the environment.We want to move consideration of health issues to the middle of the [plastics] conversation.The report lays out very clearly the goals of the global plastics treaty. What are your personal topmost goals for that effort? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . With regard to the treaty, first and foremost, I’d like to see some kind of cap or limitation on global production of new plastic. Second, regulation of the chemicals that go into plastics. It’s unconscionable that we know nothing about the toxicity of 75 percent of the chemicals in plastics. That’s just wrong. The same companies that make pharmaceuticals gladly take those chemicals through extensive pre- and post-market assessment, and yet they fight to avoid any such assessment when it comes to plastic chemicals.Then, at an infrastructure level, the treaty has to be properly financed, and there need to be provisions in the treaty that allow it to be updated and course corrections made as new science comes in. There’s a lot of other little things, but those are the big ones.Are you wary that the current administration will not be willing to go along with the treaty?I strongly suspect that the Trump administration will not go along with the treaty, if it has any teeth at all. But again, as I say, some of these reforms take time, and one just has to wait for the proper moment. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . What crystallizes in your mind for what you want to see come out of the Lancet Countdown effort?The model that we’re following is the model of the Lancet Climate Countdown, which has been up and about now for about nine years. They started small, and they’ve grown over time, and they’ve done a really excellent job of tracking the health impacts of climate change. And I think, more than the specifics, the overarching thing that they’ve done is that they have moved consideration of health effects to the center of the climate conversation. Ten years ago, I think most of the climate conversation was about the Keeling Curve, was about molecules in the upper atmosphere. It didn’t speak much to the human condition. And today, I think when people talk about climate change, they almost inevitably think about fires, floods, rising sea levels, and the impacts of all of that on human health.Right now, I think when most people think about plastic, if they think about it at all, they think about whales or turtles or beaches that are loaded up with plastic waste. We want to do what the Climate Countdown has done, and move consideration of health issues to the middle of the conversation. Specifically, we’ll track production levels, we’ll track pollution, we’ll do our best to track disease, and fourthly, we’ll track societal responses to the problem.What is the key indicator or metric that you’ll be watching that you think speaks most to the goals of this specific Lancet countdown? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . We’re still hammering those out, but I think two that are going to rise to the surface are going to be global plastic production, with some kind of breakdown by polymer type and by country. And the second big one will be levels of plastic chemicals in the bodies of people, basically in blood and in urine.Various countries—the USA, Canada, the EU, Korea—have been monitoring plastic chemicals in people’s blood and urine now for several decades. And we’ve seen some very interesting trends that some chemicals, like brominated flame retardants, have gone down over time. PFAS have gone up. When you’re looking at whole populations with a statistically robust sample, these bio monitoring surveys provide powerful evidence of what people are exposed to.Do you think there’s any outside chance, given what you know about the health effects of plastics, that the human body might surprise us, that there might be some kind of a biological mitigation for the negative effects we are expecting? Is there any chance that the human body might be somehow surprisingly efficient at clearing these chemicals?I don’t know. That’s an interesting possibility, and the human body surprises us every day. To be more pessimistic, though, and to put it in evolutionary terms, plastic is not something that our species has grown up with. I mean, our species had no experience with plastic until, let’s say, 75 years ago. And only in the last 25 years have we encountered the amounts of plastic that we’re seeing today. So we’ve certainly had no evolutionary time to develop a clearance mechanism. It’s possible, I suppose, that some of the existing clearance mechanisms in the body will be able to deal with plastic. Only time will tell, but I don’t think we can bank on that. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Do you have any hope that human ingenuity can meet the challenge of the mounting plastic pollution problem, and that we’ll find some kind of technological way to mitigate the problem?Again, it would be nice. But I don’t think we can bank on it. You know, magical thinking really doesn’t work very well. It must have been back in the ’80s, I think that there was something called the Chakrabarti bacterium that was supposed to eat oil spills. Well, it’s been a long time since we heard about that, and the oil spills are still with us. Lead image: Me dia / Shutterstock ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Yet even the most timeless and celebrated pieces can be ravaged by the march of the decades and centuries: Oil paint darkens, varnish cracks, textiles disintegrate. Turning back the clock can be complicated—scientifically and culturally. It requires a set of skills ranging from archaeology, chemistry, material sciences, imaging technology, and history.How the science of art conservation worksConservation starts with material analysis, whether the artwork in question is a textile, sculpture, or painting. “In the beginning of the 18th century, and increasingly into the 19th century, we started to define our practice as science-based, with a sort of rationalist philosophy,” says Glenn Wharton, Chair of the UCLA/Getty Interdepartmental Program in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage. “The idea is driven by this thought that through material analysis, we can know the object, we can know how it was made, how it’s deteriorated, and options for conservation treatment.” ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . This process can be destructive or non-destructive. A destructive approach might be to remove a tiny chip of paint from a work of art to analyze layers of paint and see how the artist originally constructed the work. But, increasingly, conservators and conservation scientists have been able to adopt technologies to make the analysis process less invasive. They often borrow these technologies from other fields, notably the medical field, says Wharton. CT scanning, for instance, can help doctors peer into bodies, but it can also help art conservation experts find tiny details in artworks, such as fingerprints and tool marks that they couldn’t see with the naked eye—without damaging the work itself.Analytical techniques zoom in on Rembrant’s artmaking process in new detail.Operation Night Watch, which aims to rehabilitate Rembrandt’s 1642 famous oil painting, at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, is one the most massive projects to rely on high-tech imaging to preserve a work of art, says Corina Rogge, president of the American Institute for Conservation and director of conservation at Houston’s Menil Collection.For this project, experts are combining macro- and micro- analytical techniques—such as hyperspectral imaging, XRF, and XRD mapping—to zoom in on Rembrant’s artmaking process. Hyperspectral imaging captures information across the electromagnetic spectrum for each pixel in an image. XRF, or X-ray fluorescence, determines elemental composition of material, and XRD, or X-ray diffraction, reveals more about the structure of a material. Knowing these details then directs conservators to the best course of action to restore a delicate work of art. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . For Operation Night Watch, conservators determined that there are 10 key elements of the artwork that need fixing, including removing and replacing a crumbly, brittle varnish that casts a gray shadow over the whole painting. To solve this dilemma, experts are gently removing the old varnish by placing non-woven tissue and a minute amount of solvent on tiny sections of the massive artwork, allowing it to dissolve, removing any last bits with a cotton swab under a microscope. They are then applying a new varnish to reinvigorate vibrant paint colors and breathe some life back into the centuries-old iconic painting. It’s no small feat for the epic work, which measures about 12 by 14.5 feet.This restoration process looks different for paintings with different needs—as well as, of course, for textiles, which may require carefully reinforcing a stitch or mending a tear, and for sculptures, which may need help from special adhesives or plaster to stay stable.A look to the future—by way of the pastFor almost as long as art has existed, people have been repairing it. So there are vast stores of accumulated knowledge about methods of preserving art. There are also copious records about what a piece of art has already gone through in terms of restoration and conservation. This is where Wharton expects AI to be the most helpful—sorting through the loads of works in a collection, noting what techniques have already been used on it, searching other systems for suitable preservation methods, and sharing that knowledge with experts across the globe. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Although more high-tech, science-informed art restoration techniques in the future could be a boon to the field, what experts really crave, they say, is more collaboration between scientists, conservators, Indigenous experts, affected communities, and the general public. For instance, Wharton mentions that in the past, solvents used to repair art were incredibly toxic and abrasive, which caused concerns for not just art but also the environment.Conservators and conservation scientists have recentered their focus from just what a piece of art is made of and how to keep it in pristine shape, Wharton notes, and are now putting more consideration into the culture from which they originated. “We’re still very much science based, but we’ve also come to realize over time that these objects in our care have values embedded in them,” he adds. “We always try to assess these values as well, which leads us towards communicating with people whose cultural heritage it is.”Scientists are also looking to learn about and even adopt more traditional practices of care, Wharton says. “The field is waking up to that now, so we’re starting to do a lot of research on just learning how things were cared for locally in the past, and maybe some of these traditions are still alive.” One of his graduate students, for example, brought back a practice of using neem trees native to India to preserve and keep pests from harming textiles in museum storage, which she had learned during work at the Mehrangarh Museum in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.As with most things art, what gets conserved and what doesn’t usually comes down to time and money. The number of restoration projects far exceeds the availability of qualified scientists in the field. And historically, it has often been the most valued works owned by wealthy individuals or institutions that were restored, Rogge says. But with the evolving field, this is changing to also include “people whose cultural heritage is being conserved,” Wharton says. Besides, there are also plenty of people who say that, in some cases, a work’s aging is just part of the process. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .

Zaborowska has written, and she provides ample evidence for this judgment. Art, Baldwin stated, “has its roots in the lives of human beings: the weakness, the strength, the absurdity. . . . It belongs to all of us, and this includes our foes, who are as desperate and as vacuous and as blind as we are and who can only be as evil as we are ourselves.” “[A] victim,” he wrote, “may or may not have a color, just as he may or may not have virtue.” Baldwin’s realization that suffering does not create virtue and that victims are not necessarily good people was, as he knew, a “difficult . . . unpopular notion, for nearly everyone prefers to be defined by his status, which, unlike his virtue, is ready to wear.” This is even more true today, when the intersectional grid draws rigid lines between “oppressor” and “oppressed” that Baldwin, despite the animus against white America that ballooned as he aged, was far too subtle a thinker to accept. His friendships with Jews, whites, Communists, and atheists at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx made him suspicious of easy racial categorization, and “[t]he rich mix of his white, Black, Jewish, leftist, southern, and queer teachers and mentors helped him craft the sophisticated literary tools he used to reach that understanding,” as Zaborowska says. more here.

      "content": "Since their introduction into the Mississippi River Basin by accident in the 1970s, invasive Asian carp have grown to pose one of the greatest economic and ecological challenges facing the watershed. The fish have become a real headache for policymakers due to their rapid reproduction rate and voracious diet, which enable them to outcompete the river’s native aquatic species. Over the years, goals for controlling the fish have shifted from a dream of full extermination to a more pragmatic approach that aims to keep the fish out of the Great Lakes at all costs. At the heart of that approach is a deceptively big challenge: creating a market for carp, which means convincing American consumers that carp are delicious. According to experts, a long-term solution to protect Great Lakes ecosystems from the invaders will involve states up and down the Mississippi River Basin collaborating on making commercial fishing of the carp sustainable. But for now, individual states are paving the way. Ethan Chism and Cody Jordan, two invasive carp specialists with the Arkansas Game & Fish Commission, catch a fish from their net. Credit: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette In 2018, Illinois implemented a grant program providing $8,000 to carp processors to expand their markets and sales. The state has also utilized increased funding to pay commercial fishers to remove carp very successfully. The results have been impressive. In 2023, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources removed 750,000 pounds of invasive carp during a 10-day sweep through the Illinois River. The agency reports its efforts have reduced carp density in up river areas by 95 percent over the last 13 years. But Illinois is the last line of defense keeping the carp out of the Great Lakes. Carp don’t care much about state borders, and if the uncontrollable spread continues lower in the river basin, the problem will only get worse for downstream ecosystems and continue to put pressure on the Great Lakes. One state that’s faced serious issues with carp is Arkansas, which has been linked definitively to the first outbreak in the Mississippi River all the way back in the 1960s. Now, the Natural State is taking inspiration from other basin states and implementing a pilot program to create both demand for the carp and a place to process them — with the ultimate goal of taking out 1.6 million pounds of fish from the river, more than five times the number the state has been able to harvest over the last four years. The invasive carp in question are not one single species but rather a group of four species native to Asia that have all been introduced in the U.S.: the bighead carp, black carp, grass carp and silver carp (a fish now infamous to fishers and recreationists because of its affinity for leaping its 40-pound body out of the water when disturbed). In 2021, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service changed the designation from “Asian carp” to “invasive carp” in the wake of anti-Asian hate crimes. What makes these gigantic, googly-eyed fish such a problem? According to zoologist Jim Garvey at Southern Illinois State University, they have the potential to rapidly outcompete native species and destroy crucial, endangered biodiversity throughout the watershed. “There is a real concern that this valuable biodiversity we have in North America is being challenged by these species,” Garvey says. “What we’ve found over the last 20 years or so since the invasion has really taken off is that there’s a lot of evidence to suggest these carp are having impacts on certain native fish, and probably impacts on native mussels as well. They’re certainly poised to get into the Great Lakes, which has a huge economic value from a recreational and commercial fishing standpoint.” Chism holds up two species of invasive carp. The carp were introduced by accident into U.S. waterways during the 1970s. Credit: Phillip Powell, Arkansas Times Garvey says the carp are outcompeting beloved natives like bass and catfish because the carp can reproduce far faster and are intent on eating up the plankton that young bass and catfish need to survive. Congress has taken notice and has pushed money into the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to control the species’ expansion since 2014, with $31 million appropriated to address the problem in fiscal year 2024. With the federal support, Illinois has launched a serious backstopping effort to keep the fish from entering Lake Michigan through the Des Plaines River and Chicago waterways. Congress also backstopped the invasive carp problem with an investment of nearly $226 million into the electric lock system on the Brandon Road dam, which is located 27 miles southwest of Chicago and intended to keep the fish out of the Great Lakes. The lock system includes layered technologies, such as an electric barrier that shocks approaching fish and a flushing lock that pushes fish downstream with powerful currents. All the technologies work together to prevent carp from getting in while allowing shipping commerce to continue between the river and the Great Lakes. Two groups aim to coordinate the solution to the carp problem: The decades-old Mississippi Interstate Cooperative Resource Association (MICRA) is handling the invasive carp removal projects funded by Congress, while the Invasive Carp Regional Coordinating Committee (ICRCC) is laser-focused on keeping the carp out of the Great Lakes. Here in the U.S., the invasive carp are a big environmental problem, and even a problem for recreation in some circumstances. Easily disturbed, the silver carp can jump up to 10 feet out of the water, which poses a physical hazard for anglers and their boats. Moreover, the outdoor recreation industry is up in arms over the carp because they threaten native species that people like to fish for. But across the world in China, people eat carp daily. So the easy solution, according to environmental economist Ben Meadows at the University of Alabama-Birmingham, would be to encourage Americans to eat the fish. But it’s not as easy as it sounds, says Meadows. “The issue with carp is they create damage but they are not yet a commercial species,” Meadows says. “So, if you think about it, they are net-negative and we just don’t have an economic model to deal with a net-negative. When we talk about pests, we can talk about minimizing their costs, and if we are talking about an economically valuable species, we have a road map to do that. But a species oscillating between the two? That’s unique.” Weighed down by negative news? Our smart, bright, weekly newsletter is the uplift you’ve been looking for. [contact-form-7] And American consumers don’t care much for the carp, says Meadows. But ironically, Americans might have to start eating carp in order to keep them from outcompeting wild fish they do want to eat, like largemouth bass. Meadows explains that there is a stigma attached to invasive carp — that they are dirty, bottom-feeding fish — which make them unpalatable to many consumers, even if their rich, white meat makes them delicious. States have been encouraging commercial fishing operations to catch the carp for years, with very mixed results. In Arkansas, for example, the Game and Fish Commission only offers anglers $0.18 per pound of carp through their Invasive Carp Harvest Incentive Program funded by Congress. That’s not enough, according to some fishers in the Natural State. “The price is low. They’re expecting us to get the same price our grandpas got back in the ’60s,” says Dee Wisecarver, a commercial fisherman from Hamburg, Arkansas. He considers the carp a nuisance, often getting in the way of catching the fish he can sell profitably. From the beginning, some have speculated that the invasive carp outbreak originated in Arkansas, after the fish escaped from research centers and private farms in the Arkansas Delta into the Mississippi River tributary, the White River, in the 1960s. Garvey disputes that Arkansas is the source of the entire outbreak, which now affects most of the Mississippi River watershed, but Arkansas had the first documented carp escapees.

Credit: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette But regardless of where the problem began, as Garvey notes, because invasive carp don’t care about state borders, solving the problem will require a multi-state approach. Just as carp may have spread from the lower Mississippi Basin decades ago, the root of their population needs to be tackled lower in the river today. At a policy level, much will depend on whether policy makers can galvanize demand for carp and build the infrastructure needed to support the market. In the 2024 MICRA report on invasive carp removal, Arkansas reported it had removed 310,000 pounds of carp from waterbodies since the harvest program began in 2021. But the state achieved that by paying in-house fishers to periodically sweep tributaries of the Mississippi River in Arkansas, which is not a sustainable long-term solution. “While not lacking utility, current agency control efforts are limited in scope to achieve meaningful biomass removal from all major infested waters within Arkansas,” the report said. According to Matt Horton, the aquatic nuisance species program coordinator for Arkansas Game and Fish (AG&FC), the fish are caught, euthanized and then thrown back into the main channel of the river in which they were caught. With no local demand for the fish, and no market infrastructure in place, the fish go to waste. A crew of AG&FC employees make it their job to purge as many as they can from Arkansas waterways all year round. But now, Arkansas is adopting an approach pioneered by Illinois to move from wasteful mass removal of the carp, to getting at the root cause of their out-of-control population growth. Jimmy Barnett, the invasive carp biologist for AG&FC, said on the Cache River that the program is in transition, with future funding from the federal government to be used for research, monitoring and building up commercial fishing, which he hopes will contribute more to keeping the carp out of the Great Lakes. According to Horton, Arkansas will soon be announcing its new pilot grant program — what Horton called an “opportunity” — to bring processing plants to the state. Or, at least, make accessing out-of-state processing plants easier for Arkansan fishers. “In addition to the low market value of these fish, the problem with Arkansas is we’ve got a bunch of commercial fishermen, and we’ve got interest from a large number of them to catch and remove these fish, they just don’t have markets to sell to,” says Horton. There are gaps in the supply chain, too. There are currently no commercial fish processing plants in Arkansas. The closest plant, Moon River Foods, is in Indianola, Mississippi, about an hour’s drive from the Arkansas border. According to fisherman Dee Wisecarver, that plant hasn’t been processing carp for several years. A spokesperson for Moon River could not be reached for comment. Jimmy Barnett, an invasive carp biologist with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, pilots a boat on the Cache River. Credit: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette “The problem is, there’s nobody buying them,” Wisecarver said. “You’ve got people that want you to ice them down, drive them for three, four hours. Nobody’s going to do that. Not for pennies.” Here’s how the program will work: Grantees, which could be processors, will get a per-pound subsidy to purchase fish from riverside pickup centers. This money is meant to offset the cost of transporting the fish to processing locations, which could help to create a market and alleviate the demand issue. “We’re just getting started. There’s a lot of learning on our part. Trying to build relationships, trust with our commercial fishers and with the industry,” Horton says. “One of the main questions [processors] have: Is there a large enough harvester base in the state to meet their market demand?” As Horton explained, carp processors aren’t interested in sending trucks to pick up a carp harvest unless they are sure that Arkansas fishers will have a decent harvest waiting for them. The pilot program will be aimed at guaranteeing the processors a certain volume of carp to get them interested in building an Arkansas market. According to Horton, around $240,000 has been approved and is set to go to two vendors (Horton wouldn’t disclose which companies were chosen). That money will help support the removal of 1.6 million pounds of carp, about five times the number AG&FC has harvested from the river since 2021. “It can make a difference,” he says. “If we can illustrate proof-of-concept with this, then it justifies us getting more funding to implement more of this in the future.” Wait, you're not a member yet?

Join Cancel anytime Expanded contracts with commercial fishers and grants for market infrastructure are all that’s needed to make carp removal sustainable. Meadows says marketing will be the key. In 2022, Illinois launched a marketing campaign called “Choose Copi” in an attempt to rebrand carp as “copi,” a healthy, delicious, locally caught fish. But Illinois also has dozens of markets, processors, and distributors already getting copi to the masses. Arkansas is starting nearly from scratch. With marketing, infrastructure and commercial fishing support, Meadows thinks carp fishing can become an economic win over time. But it’s going to require a sustained, coordinated effort. “They’re here to stay. You’re never going to get rid of them. Twenty years from now, people are going to be eating them all the time, because that’s just going to be the fish we got,” Wisecarver says.

(He had a first-rate take on Pope Leo’s papacy up on the latter’s website within a day of the new pontiff’s ascent.) The Life You Save May Be Your Own, Elie’s group biography of four prominent midcentury Catholic writers and intellectuals (Flannery O’Connor, Dorothy Day, Walker Percy, and Thomas Merton), is one of the best achieved examples of a tricky genre. He manages to make the fact of his faith very clear while remaining uninsistent about it—unlike, say, the profoundly annoying Ross Douthat, who can’t and won’t shut up about his conversion to Catholicism (as strongly as many of us wish he would). As a critic and historian Elie has clarity, depth, and range—qualities that serve him well as he navigates the stormy and turbid high/low waters of his chosen decade’s cultural output. Elie is an unusual figure in the secular publications and the lists of the publishers he writes for because he takes religion and its manifestations as primary—not simply as an area of culture (film, music, lifestyle, and so on) treated as just another subject for investigation. more here.

      "content": "In his famous Socratic dialogue, “The Republic,” the Greek philosopher Plato introduced what would come to be known as the allegory of the cave. In his scenario, a portion of the human population is confined to a cave, where they’re chained by their legs and necks and forced to stare solely at a cave wall upon which shadows of objects from the outside world are projected. Having been imprisoned inside the cave for as long as they can remember, the prisoners come to regard the shadows flickering across the rocky wall as direct, unmediated reality. Shadows of wild animals are, to the captives, the flesh-and-blood menagerie itself; the shadows of grass, clouds, lightning, temples, arches — all likewise the genuine articles rather than crude signifiers rendered without detail or dimension.Directly behind the imprisoned cave-dwellers, meanwhile, lay another group of people — those individuals responsible for casting the shadows. These captors, which Plato referred to as “bearers,” were free to come and go as they pleased, and drew on an ample repertoire of objects, sculptures and woodcarvings to meticulously recreate the material world beyond the cave walls for their captives.When Plato first conceived of this allegory over two millennia ago, he sought to highlight the sharp distinction between the limits of sensory perception and the true forms of the world, those Platonic ideals that the philosopher believed could only be accessed through careful reasoning and enlightened discernment. In the 2,500 years since Plato’s time, his cave allegory has accrued a new, arguably more urgent resonance. Our 21st-century civilization is increasingly absorbed by a growing clutch of social media platforms and the technological devices that serve as their vessels; a significant proportion of the human race seems to have voluntarily retreated to what is, effectively, our own versions of Plato’s cave. Hunched over, silent and rapt, these individuals peer into fathomless websites and algorithmically driven applications that glow with an endless panoply of text, images and videos, all simulacra of our shared physical reality. Today’s popular platforms — Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat — have effectively turned the cave wall into a kaleidoscope of endless entertainment, a tessellation of screens on which to project glittering fragments of human experience. And just like the chained captives in Plato’s cave, we, too, have our own bearers: the savvy tech entrepreneurs who’ve constructed their own version of the wall, along with a dazzling repertoire of novel mechanisms for casting shadows onto it. These contemporary counterparts often insist that their technologies are conferring a social good, that they are designed and developed to bring us closer together — or at least help solve the intractable scourge of loneliness, ultimately delivering us to a fantastical future.The analogy breaks down with the broader epistemological context of the captives. While the prisoners in Plato’s cave believed the shadows flickering across the cave wall were the one and only empirical reality, today’s social media users still know otherwise. They’re fully aware of the material world and largely remain in regular contact with it, maintaining their ability to delineate between their offline lives and the ones they inhabit on their devices. Plato’s allegory ends with someone escaping the cave, discovering the outside world and “the things themselves.” It takes some time for Plato’s ancient fugitive to adjust his eyes to the bright, sun-spangled world outside his subterranean prison. Eventually, though, he trains his gaze on the all-encompassing splendor around him: He looks at the “heavenly bodies,” “the light of the stars and the moon” and finally the sun, which he quickly surmises “is the source for the seasons and the years, and governor of every visible thing.”Enthralled by the vibrant, three-dimensional landscape, he marvels at the pulsating primary sources that informed the shadows that long circumscribed his reality. Amid his euphoric awakening, the escapee feels a pang of guilt: his fellow captives continue to fester in their underground cave, still impoverished by the elaborate deception of their captors. He resolves to return to the cave to free them. When he reaches the prisoners, he describes the world outside the cave, urging them to join him beyond the shadows and stone. But they are not immediately convinced. Observing him carefully, they note how his vision in the darkness has deteriorated. Having fully adjusted to the sunlight outside the cave, he’s no longer able to decipher the shadows flitting across the cave wall, that vast lexicon that still represents the full breadth of reality for the captives. The prisoners regard this new deficiency — along with the emancipation that ostensibly caused it — with suspicion, even derision. Instead of agreeing to be freed, Plato explains, the captives “raise their hands against” their would-be liberator, and they kill him. \"Today’s popular platforms have effectively turned the cave wall into a kaleidoscope of endless entertainment, a tessellation of screens on which to project glittering fragments of human experience.\" Dissonance & DependenceWhile much has been written about our deepening relationship with social media over the past decade, some of it bears repeating here. A 2023 Gallup poll found that adolescents now spend just under five hours a day on the various platforms that comprise the current social media landscape. These figures have been trending higher, too, with recent research suggesting that the amount of time people from all age groups spend on these sites has increased more than 50% since 2013 — jumping from 90 minutes daily in 2013 to around 145 minutes in 2024.  Such dramatic shifts in how we spend our time have had palpable psychological impacts. Researchers have determined that excessive social media use is linked to depression, anxiety, concerns about body image and other forms of mental distress. In an August 2024 Harris poll, nearly 60% of Gen Z respondents felt social media has had a negative impact on their generation as a whole, and around half of those polled wished that TikTok, X (formerly known as Twitter), and Snapchat had never been invented at all. Meanwhile, a 2020 Pew study found that nearly two-thirds of American adults felt that social media platforms were having an adverse effect on the country.The stark cognitive dissonance between how people feel about social media and how they use it is one sign that we have entered a new era in our relationship with these platforms. While these sites have been constantly evolving ever since Mark Zuckerberg and his Harvard University classmates first launched “TheFacebook” in February 2004, there has been a striking change in their makeup, content and user engagement since the Covid-19 pandemic.That transformative global crisis accelerated incipient trends, nudging more of people’s social lives and cultural consumption online. With entire populations sequestered away under quarantine, our time spent on social media platforms ticked upward, increasing the quiet, largely unspoken dependence many would come to tacitly accept. Five years on, Instagram and TikTok have become a chief matrix for much of millennial and Gen Z culture, politics and entertainment. These changes are infiltrating our offline lives, influencing the way we socialize, communicate and even develop our sense of self.In doing so, these platforms are actively reshaping our futures in subtle yet significant ways. As these shadows on the cave wall have grown increasingly complex and specific, they’ve started to divorce themselves from the physical world to which they once referred — pulling us away from our empirical reality and deeper into a virtual one. Over time, our growing intimacy with these technologies may lead to more profound estrangement, as we travel farther into mesmerizing digital landscapes untethered from the physical world they were once purported to bring us closer to. ‘Twilight Of The Social Networking Era’For years, Meta’s public-facing philosophy centered around a single overarching tenet: people long to connect with one another. Meta believed that this instinct was an essentially propitious one; when successfully facilitated, these connections triggered a cascade of related social goods. Just a few months before Facebook went public, in February 2012, CEO Mark Zuckerberg penned an open letter to the company’s prospective investors. Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote, “was built to accomplish a social mission — to make the world more open and connected.” Personal relationships, he explained, were the vital, irreducible building blocks of society, ideas and individual happiness, and his platform was dedicated to fostering them. “At Facebook,” he wrote, “we build tools to help people connect with the people they want and share what they want, and by doing this we are extending people’s capacity to build and maintain relationships.”A decade-plus on, the letter broadcasting Zuckerberg and his company’s social mission feels like a quaint relic from a time when such quixotic doctrines were taken on good faith. Facebook would change tack several times in the intervening 13 years, acquiring other platforms, incorporating more short-form videos and allowing its proprietary algorithm to play a disproportionately large role in what people see in their feeds. As a result, the ways people use Facebook — along with other social media platforms that evolved in a similar direction — have shifted dramatically over the span of a single generation. Although Meta’s properties and their competitors are still occasionally called “social networks,” the 2020s have seen the socializing dimension of these platforms gradually wither away. \"The stark cognitive dissonance between how people feel about social media and how they use it is one sign that we have entered a new era in our relationship with these platforms.\" In a 2022 academic paper on social media use, University of Kansas researcher Jeffrey Hall described the ways in which social media apps like Facebook, X and Instagram were no longer as interested in facilitating personal relationships. “Very soon, algorithms, rather than user-selected social networks, will determine what we see on social media,” he wrote. It was a prescient encapsulation for how these platforms operate today, and when I spoke to Hall, he was unequivocal in his assessment of the changing role these sites play in our daily lives. “It’s over,” he said, in reference to the era of genuine social networking. “The content we see now is predominantly either advertising content, content being pushed by Meta or Google, or it’s content developed by semi-professional and professional content creators.” In his paper, he referred to this phenomenon as the “twilight of the social networking era.” Zuckerberg himself acknowledged this swerve when he took the stand in federal court in April, in the early stages of the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust trial against Meta. The CEO told the court that Facebook, Meta’s flagship platform, had recently drifted more toward “the general idea of entertainment.” To emphasize the point, the corporation’s legal team presented internal data showing how users were spending increasingly less time interacting with friends on Facebook, along with screenshots illustrating, they claimed, how indistinguishable Facebook had become from its competitors. (One source I spoke with casually mentioned having “five versions of TikTok” on his smartphone.) As The New Yorker’s Kyle Chayka put it, Meta’s defense team’s arguments demonstrate “how stultifying the entire online ecosystem has become.”The trial, which is still underway, was less a revelation than a recapitulation. If the aughts were a period of exuberance and sanguinity about the potential paths of the internet — when social networks were seen as fertile ground for virtual communities and the democratization of ideas — the 2020s have been a lurch into disillusionment.As Hall and other researchers have pointed out in recent years, users’ experiences on Facebook, X and Instagram are far less interactive and participatory than they were a decade ago. The rise of paid advertisements, influencer content and short-form videos — to say nothing of AI — has muddied the waters where friends used to swim together more freely. As a result, people are sliding into more passive and often unconscious modes of engagement. The American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life declared in a newsletter earlier this year, “Social media has become a place of rapid and repeated consumption rather than one fostering dynamic social engagement.”When I log onto my own social media profiles today, my mind’s eye sweeps anxiously over selfies, reels, vlogs and ads, an addling landscape now sodden with a phantasmagoria of AI-generated content. This disorienting terrain evokes the hyper-saturated tableau of “Blade Runner,” where digital billboards, flickering neon signs and garish commercial fantasies bathe an otherwise barren Los Angeles in an eerie artificial life. Though the city is colorful and dynamic — even the umbrella shafts emit a spectral glow — there’s also a creeping sense of dissonance, a feeling that the inhabitants are being idly borne by a powerful current of technological forces that have long escaped their control.Another apt comparison for where we are — and where we’re heading — is the future of entertainment as prophesied by David Foster Wallace in his encyclopedic opus, “Infinite Jest.” The novel’s eponymous film is a work so seductive and spellbinding that anyone who views it becomes quickly addicted, setting off a speedy demise in which they view the movie on an endless loop and abandon all other aspects of their lives. While few people would accuse the current content on Facebook of being “lethally entertaining,” as “Infinite Jest” is described in Wallace’s novel, TikTok comes somewhat closer.As a raft of recent studies attest, these platforms are shifting from their original use-cases to vehicles of mindless entertainment and zombie scrolling. Portals of distraction increasingly sealed off from the physical world, social media is being severed from the nexus that once made Zuckerberg at least partly justified when he called Facebook a tool for “extending people’s capacity to build and maintain relationships.” In this newly passive, docile consumption model, content is fittingly delivered to users in a livestock-adjacent “feed” — an idea presaged by M.T. Anderson’s 2002 dystopian novel of the same name. Human agency and volition are becoming more and more difficult to locate, as people’s tastes and desires dissolve into the algorithm and its authoritarian prophecies. \"Although Meta’s properties and their competitors are still occasionally called 'social networks,' the 2020s have seen the socializing dimension of these platforms gradually wither away.\" The Artificial AbyssIn his 1886 philosophical treatise “Beyond Good and Evil,” Friedrich Nietzsche writes, “If you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.” As with many of Nietzsche’s aphorisms, this maxim has developed an uncanny contemporary resonance, especially when we consider the rapid emergence of artificial intelligence. Since OpenAI debuted its first ChatGPT model in November 2022, AI content has bloomed like verdant algae across Facebook, blanketing feeds in prodigal children, preternatural vistas and discomfiting religious imagery that appears to have clawed its way out of a mad zealot’s fever dream. These images, often generated in under a minute by AI generators like Midjourney and DALL-E, are used to spam news feeds and hack rapid engagement. In 2024, then-Stanford University misinformation researcher Renée Diresta and Josh Goldstein, a fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, noted in a Harvard Kennedy School paper that “images from AI models are already being used by spammers, scammers, and other creators running Facebook Pages and are, at times, achieving viral engagement.” While no credible study has yet definitively determined the percentage of Facebook content that’s now AI-generated, plenty of outlets have reported on a surge in these kinds of posts.Louis Barclay, a software developer and current fellow at the nonprofit Mozilla Foundation who was banned from Facebook and Instagram for creating a digital tool that allowed users to delete their news feeds, believes the content mix on these sites is rapidly devolving. “These platforms have filled up with what people call AI slop,” he told me. “When you go to these platforms now, it’s not going to take long before you see some properly weird stuff.” As AI-generated posts continue to overwhelm Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, it’s unclear to what degree actual human communication will persist on these platforms, and what those remnants will look like.In 2024, Meta announced a new policy in which it would begin labeling AI content on its platforms when content moderators “detect industry standard AI image indicators or when people disclose that they’re uploading AI-generated content.” The company’s compliance with its own policy since that announcement, however, has been inconsistent. Places that once functioned as digital squares where people shared, gossiped, preened and vented are now staging grounds for an implacable new agent. Over time, these environments may come to feel as though they’re infected with a superintelligent virus that naturally spreads faster than human thought, discretion or creativity ever could.Unsettling as this dystopian scenario sounds, it’s also part of the broader arc of social media. By permitting artificial intelligence to seep into these ecosystems and flood them with uncanny simulacra of our taste and sensibilities, the tech corporations behind these platforms are eroding the conduit between their products and the offline world. Intended or otherwise, the ultimate effect is to choke off the feedback loop with real life that once made these spaces more expansive, participatory environments.The abyss, in other words, has begun to gaze back. And its disconcerting features — Jesus resurrected as a grotesque chimera, AI models luxuriating in AI locales — glower out from our glowing screens with a kind of otherworldly contempt.Online FriendsIn a media blitz this past spring, Zuckerberg sketched out a future in which AI chatbots play a prominent role in people’s lives: artificially expanding their social circles and filling the void of loneliness.Zuckerberg told Stripe co-founder John Collison at Stripe’s annual conference in May, “I think people are going to want a system that knows them well and that kind of understands them in the way that their feed algorithms do.” He was referring to the potential of AI friends, which could theoretically draw on the same personalized data as Facebook’s algorithm to interact with users on a hyper-individualized level. The public response to Zuckerberg’s not-so-subtle pitch for the next generation of his own products was swift. Writers, pundits and social media’s human participants found Zuckerberg’s framing of the future distasteful, even morally objectionable. In late July, Zuckerberg faced additional criticism when he laid out his vision for a highly accessible “personal superintelligence” that Meta hoped to weave into personal devices like its AI glasses.There was an underlying irony to all the negative reactions. Recent findings on how people are using generative AI today suggest that there may, in fact, be an untapped appetite for the kind of world Zuckerberg has been invoking in his media appearances. An April 2025 study published in the Harvard Business Review showed that, over the preceding 12 months, the single highest use case for generative AI was therapy and/or companionship. \"The abyss, in other words, has begun to gaze back.\" Despite our reflexive misgivings as a society, it seems that individuals are starting to use AI for these interpersonal needs, and at scale. In the future, we may engage regularly and even seamlessly with a community of chatbots specifically engineered to comfort us, mirror us and tell us exactly what we want to hear. On Instagram, social media chatbots are already making their peculiar presence felt. Last summer, Meta introduced AI Studio on Instagram, a program originally designed to help users with large followings leverage AI chatbots to answer questions, engage with fans, and generally function as extensions of themselves. But in just over a year, this technology has mutated well beyond its stated use case. Earlier this year, a user created an AI chatbot of Kurt Cobain. Within a few days, over 100,000 people had interacted with the digital doppelgänger of the Nirvana frontman, including individuals who asked him lurid questions about his death by suicide (to which he responded with disturbing candor).Meta was not the first tech company to develop this kind of artificial intelligence. Launched in 2021, Character AI allows people to interact with millions of different chatbots, including not only fictional characters but also facsimiles of historical figures. (Character AI is currently facing multiple lawsuits alleging that its chatbots encouraged harmful behavior, including suicide, in teenagers.) Beyond the morbid headlines, the ascent of these AI companions raises fundamental questions about the nature of social interactions and how stripping out their humanity — literally — stands to reshape our own psyches and interpersonal growth.Jeff Pooley, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, believes that the advent of AI on social media could lead to increasingly artificial social interactions, ultimately altering human development in the process. “In the stuff that I’m teaching and interested in, the fundamental claim is that the self is social,” Pooley told me. “Going back to George Herbert Mead and even Hegel, we form our sense of self through interactions with others.” Pooley was referencing Mead’s theory of self, which postulates that our identities emerge out of connecting, communicating and role-playing with others. But if more of these social experiences shift to large language models, this longstanding path of psychosocial maturation could be jeopardized. Reflecting on how an onslaught of AI content has already inundated our social media environments, I kept returning to “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice,” a segment from the 1940 Disney animated classic, “Fantasia.” The brief, evocative tale is about what happens when the titular character — who also happens to be Mickey Mouse — tries to wield a powerful magic he can’t control. Based on a 1797 poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the story sees Mickey animate a broom to take over the menial task of filling a cauldron with water that the sorcerer has assigned him.After Mickey falls asleep, however, that single broom rapidly multiplies into a throng of them, an army of wood-and-bristle golems compelled by a single command: Fill the cauldron. The vivified tools carry out their task with such relentless efficiency that the sorcerer’s entire lair is quickly submerged, and Mickey is sucked into a yawning whirlpool, a dumbfounded look plastered across his guileless face. When many of us log onto our social media accounts today and start scrolling through our news feeds, it seems to me that we’re not unlike Mickey, waking up to a legion of mindless brooms, filling a bucket that’s already flooding the room.  The Intimacy Of The AlgorithmThese changes, across social media platforms where billions of people spend vast amounts of their waking time, are likely to impact our offline lives as well. Our politically polarized society in the U.S. has been firmly linked to the social media algorithms and filter bubbles of the past decade. Our insulated news feeds amplify like-minded posts and compatible views to such a degree that we are rarely exposed to opposing perspectives; moderating voices have all but vanished in an information ecosystem that disincentivizes them. Gradually, this systemic division in our digital spheres has eroded the common ground in our physical ones, fraying the social fabric that once gave our country a semblance of cohesion. Our current trajectory promises more knock-on effects from our engagement with these platforms. The term “digital solipsism,” coined in 2021 by I.R. Medelli, a philosophy student at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, describes how social media immerses us in information ecosystems that validate our views while rarely forcing us to confront conflicting perspectives. The disembodied nature of these experiences — as well as these platforms’ ability to curate feeds that reflect our own beliefs and sensibilities — nudge us toward a more narcissistic, less interdependent way of seeing the world. \"Our insulated news feeds amplify like-minded posts and compatible views to such a degree that we are rarely exposed to opposing perspectives.\" Jenn Louie held leadership positions at Facebook and Google for nearly a decade before suffering what she termed a “crisis of conscience.” From her perch as the head of platform integrity at Facebook, she watched as misinformation and disinformation grew progressively worse, eventually contributing to “violence, terrorism, manipulation, fraud and victimization,” she told me. Disillusioned with how ineffectual Facebook’s content moderation efforts were, she left the corporate world and began focusing on ways to make social media safer and more fulfilling. Today, Louie is equally concerned with people’s emotional attachments to highly personalized social media algorithms. “We already see that there’s a certain level of intimacy with which people relate to their social media profiles,” she said. “I think they’re becoming increasingly entwined and threaded into our lives in ways where we feel a type of relationship and intimacy that we do not want to be extracted from.” Now an AI safety consultant working for the United Nations, Louie fears that this deepening intimacy could eventually compromise other aspects of our identities, including our human relationships and the sense of agency we have over our lives.  Artificial intelligence is poised to play a pivotal role in this emerging intimacy. When I spoke to Daniel Barclay, the executive director of the San Francisco-based nonprofit Center for Humane Technology, he invoked the term “AI sycophancy” to describe the way that chatbots are being engineered to be deferential and ingratiating with users. Many tech companies now feel pressured to build AI models that exhibit this type of obsequious behavior, fearing they will lose market share to competitors who do. “If I don’t make my model flattering and sycophantic,” Barclay said, “then the other AI company will.”As these LLMs are integrated into our social media platforms, chatbots programmed for AI sycophancy will mirror our ideas and assuage our egos, deepening our entrenchment in a digital solipsism that’s continents away from the pluralism, intersubjectivity and human friction of the real world. For Barclay, this type of future, in which we spend our leisure time engaging with AI sycophants that come to comprise much of our social world, is a dark and dehumanizing one. “The Zuckerberg future, where you have this ersatz wall of AI companions that you’re engaging with instead of humans, I think leans pretty dystopian.”‘A Pure Absorption & Re-Absorption Surface’In his 1981 work “Simulacra and Simulation,” French philosopher Jean Baudrillard prophesied with eerie precision our shift toward lives lived largely — and someday, perhaps, primarily — in the virtual spaces of social media. In the book, Baudrillard characterizes the transition from modern to postmodern society as a movement from production to “simulation.” In a postmodern world oriented around simulation, Baudrillard argued, people are perpetually engaged with endless sources of information, entertainment and play, whether through video games, amusement parks or a dense media landscape that had yet to encompass the platforms of the century to come. These simulacra of reality are so stimulating and dynamic that they quickly surpass the “desert of the real,” achieving a hyperreality that is more intense, more vivid and more invigorating than the quotidian slog of everyday life.In the decades since Baudrillard first pinpointed the proliferation of these engrossing reproductions of the empirical world, we’ve progressed farther in the direction of hyperreality than the philosopher could have possibly fathomed. While our oversaturated digital environments provide an “ecstasy of communication,” to borrow another Baudrillard term, the consequences of the artificial world we’ve created are now bubbling to the surface. All the simulacra we’ve devised — like shadows playing across the cave wall — are unmooring us from the physical objects to which they once referred, creating a new world with few threads tying back to material reality. The result is a frantic welter of overlapping hyperrealities, as Instagram, TikTok, meme culture and AI models remix text and image at a scale that sends the mind — perhaps by design — reeling into a kind of intoxicated dissociation.Over time, such continuous exposure to these hyperrealities may leave human beings with a limited grasp of objective truth and an atrophied capacity to form connections with the people around them. Having grown too ensconced in our AI-enhanced labyrinths of signs, symbols and references, we’ll be less comfortable navigating the humbling, frictional world of real people and real events. The ultimate outcome may be one laced with a grim but fitting irony: we ourselves start to resemble little more than the newest vessels for our vast ouroboros of content, “a pure screen a pure absorption and re-absorption surface,” as Baudrillard breathlessly put it, for today’s unceasing parade of cave shadows to pass through.

      "content": "I'm happy to announce that my book, The Origins of Efficiency, is now (officially) available for preorder, and will be released on September 23rd.1 You can preorder on Amazon, Stripe, Barnes and Noble, or Bookshop.com.Why I wrote this bookSeven years ago, I joined a well-funded, high-profile construction startup called Katerra. At the time I was a structural engineer with about ten years of experience, and over the course of my career I had become increasingly disillusioned with the inefficient state of the construction industry. Over and over again, engineers and architects were designing similar sorts of buildings, instead of building multiple copies of the same design. Contractors were putting up buildings on-site, by hand, in a way that didn't seem to have changed much in over a century.Productivity statistics told much the same story: unlike productivity in other industries, like manufacturing or agriculture, construction productivity has been flat or declining for decades, and it's only getting more expensive to build homes, apartments, and other buildings over time.Katerra had a plan for changing all that. It would efficiently build its buildings in factories rather than on-site, doing for construction what Henry Ford had done for cars. Katerra already had several factories in operation or under construction when I joined, and planned to build even more. At the time, I thought Katerra's approach was exactly what was needed to change the industry. It seemed obvious that factory-built construction would be more efficient, but that some combination of incentives, inertia, and risk aversion kept the industry locked into using old, inefficient methods of production. I thought that with a sufficient jolt, the industry could be disrupted and new, better ways of building could take root. Katerra had raised over $2 billion in venture capital to supply that jolt.But within a little over three years, Katerra had burned through all its venture capital, gone through increasingly brutal rounds of layoffs (one of which cut the engineering team I was leading by around 75%), and declared bankruptcy. I survived the layoffs, but had left the company several months before its final end. When Katerra closed its doors, I was working at a new engineering job, back to designing the same sort of buildings, built using the same old methods I'd used for most of my career.Since then, the construction industry hasn't improved its track record of productivity. In fact, post-Covid, construction costs had one of their steepest rises in history.As Katerra was collapsing, I became obsessed with understanding why things had gone so wrong, and what it would take to actually make the construction industry more efficient. I started writing Construction Physics just after I left the company, as a way to work through an understanding of how the construction industry worked and why Katerra had failed to change it.Some of Katerra's failure can be blamed on operational missteps: trying to develop too many products at once before finding product-market fit, failing to integrate acquired companies, and so on. But it also gradually became clear that Katerra's fundamental thesis — that construction would be much cheaper and more efficient if it was done in factories — was either incorrect, or woefully incomplete. Time and again at Katerra, the engineering team would design some new factory-produced building, only for the costs to come back too high. Time and again executives would complain how hard it was for Katerra, with its expensive factories and high overheads, to compete against \"Bubba and his truck,\" who could put up buildings using little more than hand tools. Rather than enabling radically cheaper construction, as Ford's assembly line had done for the Model T, Katerra's factories were making it hard to even compete in the existing market.It also became clear that Katerra was far from the first company to try and fail to transform the industry using factory-built construction. I learned that such attempts stretch back decades: from the Lustron Corporation in the 1940s, to Stirling Homex and the other Operation Breakthrough companies in the 1960s, to Veev in the 2020s. Often these companies failed as quickly as Katerra did. Other times, they managed to carve out successful businesses: National Homes successfully built prefab homes for nearly 50 years. But no one had managed to use prefab to become the Henry Ford of housing.And the problem didn't seem limited to the US. While prefab, factory-built construction is often much more popular in other countries than it is in the US, nowhere did I find it ushering in dramatic cost reductions. Toyota, arguably one of the best manufacturers in the world, formed a prefab housing company in Japan in the 1970s to apply its manufacturing expertise to homebuilding. But while in car manufacturing Toyota was so efficient and successful that it eventually set the global standard, Toyota remains a niche player in homebuilding, and its homes are surprisingly expensive compared to site-built construction.2 In Sweden, nearly all single-family homes are factory-built, but their construction costs are higher than conventionally-built homes in the US.It eventually became clear to me that we didn't really understand what it took to make some process more efficient. Those of us hoping to use factory-built construction to drive down costs were acting as a sort of cargo cult — duplicating what we saw work elsewhere, without truly understanding the mechanisms that made the process successful. To understand why the construction industry was so resistant to efficiency improvements, and why it never seemed to get cheaper to construct buildings, I needed to understand how, specifically, things get cheaper to produce over time.This book is the fruit of that effort.Over the course of roughly a year and a half, I looked at dozens of production processes — from cigarette making to package delivery, from steel production to tomato harvesting — to see how they improved over time. I read about the history of virtually every industrial improvement system: from scientific management to Lean production, from DFMA to SMED, from Taguchi methods to statistical process control. I read the work of economic historians who had studied industrial progress like Joel Mokyr, Alfred Chandler, David Hounshell, Gregory Clark, Sam Hollander, and John Enos. I bought lots and lots of books. The bibliography of the book has around 600 separate references, and on its own would be one of the longest pieces of text I've ever produced. (Writing this book is what forced me to start using proper reference management software.)I initially thought that turning all this reading into a book would be essentially the same process as writing the newsletter. At the time, my newsletters averaged around 2,000 words each, and I estimated that the book would be around 100,000 words, or require around 50 newsletters' worth of work. But I was sorely mistaken. It turns out that it's comparatively simple to write 50 stand alone pieces of text that collectively add up to the length of a book. Tying many disparate ideas into a single, coherent thesis, and then explaining that thesis via separate chapters that draw on and reference each other, is much more complex. (This is why you see so many books which are loose collections of thematically similar chapters: it's much easier to write that sort of book.)Over the course of writing the newsletter I had developed a writing process that worked very well, but this process was ill-suited to produce a book-length work. Once I signed the contract with Stripe Press, I thought I'd immediately able to start cranking out chapters, but for roughly six months I struggled to produce anything useful (there were multiple times when I sent a draft chapter to someone, then quickly followed up with \"Don't read that, it's trash,\" and started over).Writing the newsletter is essentially a linear process: I read everything I can on a topic, take note of the especially interesting or relevant facts and information, and then come up with a structure for an essay that can incorporate it all. Once this structure is in hand, it's simply a matter of expanding the basic structure into a draft, and a draft into the final version. For the book, I eventually figured out that I needed to turn this linear process into a cyclical one. Instead of going from reading to structure to draft to final version, I would read, come up with some tentative ideas for a structure, then use those ideas to guide further reading, repeating the process until I felt like things had \"clicked\" and my structure was robust. Only then could I start fleshing out the basic ideas into a draft.After several months of this, I was able to condense down the mass of information I had collected into a relatively simple framework: a small number of specific things you can do to make a process more efficient.The book is 10 chapters, plus an introduction and conclusion. Chapter 1 explains this basic framework: the structure of a production process and the options you have for making it more efficient. Chapters 2 through 6 explain each one of these strategies, drilling into the details and nuances of how they work, when they don't work, and examples of how they've reduced costs or improved operations in actual production processes. Chapters 7, 8, and 9 explain how these various strategies can work together and reinforce each other, collectively creating enormous efficiency improvements. Chapter 10 explains what happens when these paths to efficiency improvement are blocked, using the construction industry as an example.I'm immensely proud of this book; if it sounds interesting or valuable to you, I hope you'll pre-order it.1It's technically been listed on Amazon for months, but only recently have the cover and everything else been finalized.2$200-$300 per square foot in 2008.",

      "publishedAt": "2025-08-12T14:35:06.000Z",
      "content": "The paperback edition of my recent book, with a new foreword and a cheaper price, is out today! You can find it at your favorite online or brick-and-mortar retailer. After I publish this, I'm also headed to a couple of Barnes & Noble locations in New York — at Union Square and also on 5th Avenue at 46th Street — to sign some autographed copies.On the Edge was published on August 13, 2024 — that is, almost exactly one year ago. We'd carefully chosen the date to fall in the lull in between the Olympics and the Democratic National Convention, hoping to have a quiet little news cycle to ourselves.Instead, the book launched amid one of the most frenzied periods in American political history. On June 27, Joe Biden turned in the most disastrous debate performance of all-time.1 On July 13, Trump was shot while delivering a speech in Pennsylvania. Eight days later, Biden dropped out — really, he was pushed — and Kamala Harris essentially wrapped up the nomination by the end of the day.August 13 was pretty much the exact peak of Kamalamania, a.k.a. Brat Summer. She'd been rising in the polls, albeit never enough to break the race out of toss-up range. But the mood among liberal, college-educated types — i.e., the types of people who tend to buy serious nonfiction — was giddy. The headlines that day were about how Trump had bungled an X Spaces appearance with Elon Musk and how Harris might even win Florida.From a sales standpoint, this all worked out just fine. Even as we insisted on some diva-ish rules — if you wanted me on to talk about the election, you also had to let me talk about the book — the cluster-bomb of media hits, plus a lot of help from Silver Bulletin readers who had bought plenty of advance copies, sent On the Edge to #5 on the New York Times bestseller list.The downside was that the timing obscured a pretty dark narrative arc in the book (although some reviewers picked up on it). Erase Brat Summer — to some extent, it was never clear whether it was genuine or an artifact of partisan non-response bias in the polling — and the trajectory of 2024 was that Trump, at age 78 after January 6 and 34 felony convictions, had triumphantly returned to office, with the help of Musk and other Silicon Valley billionaires, right at the moment that the world was possibly on the brink of transformation. Meanwhile, Democrats had catastrophically bungled the race by renominating Biden, and hastily choosing his vice president as she rapidly cycled through various rebrands, none of which involved distancing herself from her deeply unpopular boss.The River and the Village, revisitedThe two communities that I identify in On the Edge, the River and the Village, don't formulate a neat one-to-one mapping with Republicans and Democrats. Still, in the context of an election campaign, it was a close enough approximation. The Village — my name for the risk-averse progressive establishment symbolized by institutions like Harvard and the New York Times — was and remains on its heels, discredited now even among Democrats. The 2020 election might have seemed like a triumph for the Village, with Biden winning by promising a return to normalcy and more competent handling of COVID. But over the next four years, from virtually Biden's first day in office forward, it misread the mood of voters, treating anyone who wasn't in the tribe as an alien species.The River, conversely, is my name for risk-seeking types, people who seek to maximize expected value at every opportunity, canonically associated with Wall Street and Las Vegas and Silicon Valley. Although there are exceptions like the World Series of Poker and the Manifest conference where you can find an undiluted version of the River, it's generally less of a discrete community than the Village.Still, I've had enough people come up to me and tell me they identify with the River that I think it's more than just a literary device. The River didn't used to be associated with Trumpian politics, and most of it still isn't.2 Instead, its politics were traditionally more aligned with the \"libertarianish tech-savvy nerds\" that Scott Alexander calls the Gray Tribe, the types of people who accuse others of being \"too political\".3 But a sizable faction of the River — led by Musk4 — sensed an opportunity in 2024. From the earliest days of the race, Trump was always at least as likely as not to win. But with all the expert class being card-carrying members of the Village, the right lacked human capital, and Musk and others figured to benefit by filling the vacuum.I wrote the foreword to the paperback edition of On the Edge in February and March, at which point Musk's plan seemed to be working. $TSLA stock doubled during the presidential transition, with the unelected Musk poised to play the role of co-president. But the Trump-Musk relationship didn't survive even five months.5 Meanwhile, the Trump administration has, among other things, raised tariffs to their highest levels since the 1930s, fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, deterred the bright young students that might once have founded unicorn companies from coming to the U.S. in the first place, and struck an agreement with Nvidia, the leading semiconductor manufacturer, that will deal the government in to chip sales to China, potentailly undermining American leadership in an AI race that many Riverians regard as a matter of existential importance. For good measure, it even raised taxes on gambling-related income as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.None of this is in the River's best interest — you can't make data-driven decisions if you don't have reliable data, for instance. But what's more, you can see the contours of a backlash forming. Many consumers are still boycotting Tesla, even as Musk has retreated to making smutty anime with Grok. In the past year, there have been almost too many sports-betting scandals to count. Vegas may also be entering a bust cycle right as new $5 billion resort projects are on the way. Meanwhile, in a rebuke to the River's unapologetically capitalistic spirit, a self-avowed socialist is likely to become the next mayor of New York.A compendium of River-related Google search terms shows more mixed results. (In the charts that follow, I've set the baseline to spring 2021 through spring 2024, since that's when I was reporting and writing On the Edge.) Prediction markets — I'm an advisor to Polymarket — appear to be on a growth trajectory even if sports betting isn't. A single Bitcoin now sells for almost $120,000, near its all-time high.And, of course, there's artificial intelligence, which progressively eats up a larger and larger proportion of both mindshare and capital expenditures. If there's one thing you absolutely do need to give the River credit for, it's AI. Both doomers and accelerationists saw this coming years before most people did. And AI is the one area where the White House's association with the River probably gives it smarter policies than it otherwise might have had.I'll mostly stand behind what I wrote in January, which is that the Village and the American left more broadly has been way behind the curve on AI. Even if AI comes in at only, say, the 20th percentile of reasonable expectations — the term \"reasonable\" is doing a lot of work there, I'll acknowledge — it could still be one of the most transformational technologies of the century.My personal view, as a near-daily user of large language models like ChatGPT, is that AI progress has been just a hair slower than people in the River might have expected when I finished the book. But it's well within the middle of the range — perhaps more like the 40th percentile. I consider this to be a reasonably well-informed view — I track AI progress more than I write about it in the newsletter. At the Manifest conference, for instance, some of the authors of the AI 2027 project, which envisioned a rapid takeoff for AI (very possibly with tragic consequences for us humans) had pushed back their timelines by a year or two.What's clearer is that, for better or worse, we've thrown out the steering wheel and are accelerating ahead — talk of a pause in AI development has all but disappeared. And I'm not sure even people in either The Village or The River fully appreciate the consequences. I consider Sam Altman's notion of a \"gentle singularity\" to be naive, for instance. I'm not as convinced as some other River types that an intelligence explosion is inevitable. (This deserves a longer essay or two.) But as On the Edge reports, profound technological shocks are nearly always accompanied by profound political and cultural transformation. So if we do get a singularity, nothing about it is going to be gentle.A year after the book came out, perhaps what I feel most of all — I'm sure many of you agree — is that there aren't a lot of adults in the room. One of my critiques of the Village is that it's a bubble, but you can say that for the River, too. In my periodic trips to Silicon Valley, it has increasingly felt like a foreign country, with its own values and cultural tropes, but insulated from the consequences of its own actions. Even if the Riverian mentality holds up better than the Village one under conditions where everyone is making up the rules as they go along — it's better at \"decoupling\", at focusing on the task at hand — it's also become powerful enough that it's often subtly rigging the rules in its favor. So we have the curse of living in interesting times, and I hope On the Edge is as good a guide to them as you might find.Silver Bulletin is a reader-supported publication.

Or, rather, an equalisation: a much-needed rebalancing after 150 years during which, we were told, everything was driven by males strutting, brawling and shagging, with females just along for the ride. This reckoning has finally arrived at language. The origins of our species’ exceptional communication skills constitutes one of the more nebulous zones of the larger evolutionary narrative, because many of the bits of the human anatomy that allow us to communicate – notably the brain and the vocal tract – are soft and don’t fossilise. The linguistic societies of Paris and London even banned talk of evolution around 1870, and the subject only made a timid comeback about a century later. Plenty of theories have been tossed into the evidentiary void since then, mainly by men, but now evolutionary biologist Madeleine Beekman, of the University of Sydney, has turned her female gaze on the problem. Her theory, which she describes as having been hiding in plain sight, is compelling: language evolved in parallel with caring for our “underbaked” newborns, because looking after a creature as helpless as a human baby on the danger-filled plains of Africa required more than one pair of hands (and feet). It needed a group among whom the tasks of food-gathering, childcare and defence could be divided. A group means social life, which means communication. More here. Enjoying the content on 3QD?

Now the film’s sci-fi technology is coming to the real world. This week, Meta revealed a wristband that decodes finger movements using electrical signals in the wrist. The movements are familiar to anyone with a smartphone: Pinching, swiping, tapping, and even writing. An onboard computer translates these signals into commands on a laptop screen. Without training or calibration, users tackled a range of tests, like moving a cursor to a target, playing a Pacman-like game, and writing words and phrases—“hello world”—by drawing their index fingers across a tabletop. Meta has long teased a muscle-reading wristband, with an early version that could translate computer clicks. The new device has broader capability. Powered by neural networks and trained on data from over 6,000 volunteers, the wristband achieved up to 90 percent accuracy in some tests. On average, participants could write roughly 21 words per minute, and they improved as they became more familiar with the device. More here. Enjoying the content on 3QD?

Most people have never heard of libertarian homesteaders or rationalist dating sites, perhaps you have also never heard of the things most other people belong to.For my part, I have been part of a foam combat ('boffer') organization since college. You may want to say 'that's not a community, that's just a hobby', but the people in this sport form a strong community with tight bonds outside the game itself. Not only do I go to practices twice a week, I have 2 D&D games and 1 board game night every week with mostly members of the community, members of the community are my friends that I go out to movies and dinners with, play video games with voice chat on Discord with, talk to online in Discord servers and web forums and group chats, go to parties with and gossip about with other community members. Aside from attending over a dozen weddings of community members (mostly to other community members), I've served as best man for 2 members and wedding officiant for 2 other members. The sport itself has houses, guilds, and fighting units, all with their own ethos, credos, goals, activities, and hierarchies; it has knighthoods and squireships, it has awards for arts and crafts and community service. The sport has regular camping events that end up looking like temporary compounds of hundreds to thousand+ members, lasting from a weekend to a week. We may not have a singular God or Invisible Hand we all worship, but we have strong community norms towards things like inclusion, creating positive experiences, some modernized gender-neutral version of chivalry, creating safe spaces, etc.If you didn't know me very very well, you might know that 'oh yeah, he does some kind of sword fighting thing on the weekends I think?', and not know there's a large and strong community there.I wonder how many other things are like this - I think 'oh yeah, they play softball on the weekends, oh yeah, they belong to a knitting circle, oh yeah, they go to a lot of concerts, oh yeah, they volunteer at some kind of community center', and have no idea that there's a strong close-knit community surrounding those things that remains largely invisible to outsiders.Logan (blog) writes:As another commenter (darwin) said, I think Scott is underestimating how many people are in ~5/10 \"weird\" intentional communities, comparable to rationalism. Rationalism is just more salient to him, because he's in it. A lot of 5/10 weird intentional communities are pretty invisible to people outside of them.FIRE (as in Financial Independence/Retire Early) in particular comes to mind as another weird community that absolutely corresponds with his thesis of affluence enabling more niche community-building. FIRE people have online forums and meetups, and groups of them do things like buy up most of a block of houses to take over a neighborhood in a small town in Colorado. It's way easier for everybody to go to a community meetup in the desert for a week or two if they're affluent. That applies to a FIRE meetup I went to in the desert in Utah, and also calls Burning Man to mind. Tons of people just draw the line of weirdness at a place where they can blend into \"normal\" liberal society.So a 9/10 weird cult is a really different place to draw the line, but it's really quite normal to be in a 5/10 weird community, almost certainly not only 10% like Scott estimates. And since \"weirdness\" is defined by what gets ostracized, it's notable that the communities we define as the most weird are the most illiberal - conservative/orthodox religious sects. Illiberalism is \"weird\" in a liberal society because illiberalism is definitionally the one thing that liberalism openly ostracizes.I appreciate the FIRE example - if they're taking over parts of neighborhoods, they at least get a 5/10 on my scale.Still, I will defend the claim that less than 10% of the population belongs to groups like this; I think commenters overestimate how many people don't have any cool hobbies or unique groups that they're part of. If 50K people are that seriously into FIRE, and there are a thousand communities of that size, and there's 50% overlap (e.g. someone who's both into FIRE and a Mormon), then that's still consistent with less than 10%!Mutton Dressed As Mutton writes:I think the problem with the material abundance version of tight-knit community is that most people don't really want tight-knit community. They want the benefits but not the downsides.The downsides are both real and unfortunately deeply and inextricably linked to the benefits. You can maybe buy your way out of some of the downsides, but at some point you have to accept the package. You can imagine a kibbutz that is less insane, but a kibbutz that is just a chill place where people do their own thing is not a kibbutz. Most people don't want the full kibbutz.Cartoons Hate Her makes this point better and at length: The Village Nobody Wants.Groups like the Amish (and Hasidic Jews, etc.) achieve community by raising the costs of leaving so high that most members aren't willing to bear them. Some do, and the stories are often quite sad (https://www.amazon.com/All-Who-Go-Not-Return/dp/1555977057/). Even less insular communities, like the Mormons, do something like this (although mainstream Mormons could be regarded as striking a fairly successful balance).I suspect rationalist enclaves are long-term unstable like most intentional communities. They aren't actually drafting on wealth, they are just huffing ideology and will eventually implode or explode. I've had some limited exposure to deeply rationalist subcultures, and what I mainly observed was that they were extremely weird. I say that, sincerely, without judgment -- it's fine to be weird, even good in many ways -- but weirdness doesn't seem like enough to hang a community on. The moment will pass, people will move on.I think it's worth distinguishing among four strategies for community:The medieval peasant strategy: you are stuck in a tiny village for your whole life, guess you've got community whether you like it or not.The Orthodox Jewish strategy: try to replicate the medieval peasant strategy within a large modern society by starting with an ethnicity/religion and having very high barriers to exit. The Cartoons Hate Her strategy: try to get random people close to you to form a community - but they might not find it very engaging and it might never start to begin with.The liberal (eg rationalist / libertarian / foam boffer / LGBTQ / FIRE) strategy: try to gather a particular type of person together into a \"natural\" community that feels intuitive and low-effort because members are doing things they believe in (or enjoy) with people who are deeply similar to them. Here the \"barrier to exit\" is that the community is already optimized for your preferences and you would be less happy outside of it.I claim that the first two work better in conditions of poverty (because they're based on barriers to exit), the third works only sporadically and doesn't scale, and the fourth works better in conditions of affluence (because it requires people to sort themselves, which might mean choosing where to live based for community rather than financial reasons).Ariel (blog) writes: Just because something is valuable, that doesn't mean people will put in the effort to achieve it. Even putting aside monetary issues, it's a huge effort to build a community, and people won't necessarily go ahead and do it. An advantage of religion (and maybe the techo-rationalist space) is that they provide natural conditions for building a community.But shouldn't this problem be a good match for entrepreneurial capitalism? If it's possible to create a community better than regular society, can't someone do it, charge a membership fee, and get rich?DangerouslyUnstable writes:I think the problem with this idea is that: when there isn't a single default strong community, most people do the lazy thing and choose not to participate. I think that no matter how rich people got, most people would never be part of a strong community because being part of a strong community takes effort. I think this is why, despite living in the richest nation in the history of the planet, we have some of the weakest/least amount of strong communities, which is why I find your comment that more money = more community strange. Yes, for people who care, having money makes it easier. But all of western civilization is proof that more money does not, in general, equal more community.If you make community opt-in, as liberalism does (and to be very clear, I'm pro liberalism), most people will not go to the effort of opting in. Almost everyone in the US is rich enough that, if they wanted, they could be part of a strong community. They are just uninterested in the effort that would take.I don't think \"effort\" is the exact right way of looking at this.Compare this to some sort of impressive athletic accomplishment - let's say being able to lift 300 lbs. If I wanted to be able to lift 300 lbs, this would be effortful, but not complicated. I would Google \"good gym routine\", find a gym near me, go a couple times a week, gradually ramp up, and eventually achieve my goal.If I wanted to be in a very strong community, I don't think there's any way to just \"expend effort\" and make it happen. Maybe I could learn Hebrew and convert to Orthodox Judaism, but there are lots of reasons not to do that besides just laziness (plus one extra reason for people who aren't already circumcised!) If I wanted a community of the \"ten normal-ish families on a suburban block raising children together\" variety, this seems about as tough as founding a new company, in the sense that you need to be creative, agentic, and willing to risk everything falling apart.This is what I mean by \"this space needs entrepreneurs\". If I want a Ferrari, it's going to be expensive, but not complicated. Once there are expensive and effortful, but not complicated, ways to get a good community, I'll be more willing to believe that effort is the barrier.Justin writes:The example of the Mormons is a good one, but in more ways than \"get lots of people of the same religion together in one place\". That model was certainly true of the early church, but the real innovation of modern Mormonism is exporting the same community-building model to all four corners of the earth. A common experience for Latter-day Saints traveling abroad is to be struck by how nearly identical the Sunday experience is whether in Africa, America, or Asia. The upshot of the Church's system of social organization is that it is effortless for a Latter-day Saint person to slot into a new community wherever they go, and it is likewise easy for the community to sustain itself as individuals naturally come and go while they pursue their secular lives and careers. That kind of physical location independence goes a long way towards solving the practical problems highlighted in the post.Maybe the Mormons are the entrepreneurs we're looking for?Comments About Specific CommunitiesEbrima Lelisa writes:I doubt the conclusion of this post.I've visited an Indian friend in rural Pennsylvania. Their housing community is 98% Indian. There's only 1 non-Indian family out of the 50 houses.Close to where I live there's an apartment block which is 80% Indian, especially students.If money is an issue or anti-discrimination laws then how do these communities form?Great point! And I agree Indians are the best example - too new to piggyback off older communities like Chinatowns, and usually rich enough that their proximity can't be dismissed as ghettoization. I don't really have a great explanation for this; maybe it just proves that if you're committed enough you can still make it work.Hilarius Bookbinder (blog) writes: » \"Why don't conservatives live in trad whites-only farming villages on the Great Plains?\" There seems to be a movement in exactly that direction: https://www.returntotheland.org/aboutTheir site says \"Return to the Land is a private membership association (PMA) for individuals and families with traditional views and common continental ancestry. We hold events and conferences, and we help groups of our members form European heritage communities...We will return to the land to separate ourselves from a failing modern society, and we will make positive cultural changes in ourselves and in our ancestral communities\" - so yeah, that sure is a movement towards trad whites-only farming villages.Their first test community has bought land in Arkansas, and there are a few articles on it, including this one which describes it as \"about 40 inhabitants who live on 150 acres of land [with] cabins, roads, wells, a community center, and a schoolhouse\", and this interview with movement leader Eric Orwoll, who says that \"a second Hitler won't arrive unless people do the work\", but that \"when I say, you're gonna have to wait for that new Hitler to arise, I'm not saying you're going to have to wait for a new person to start a new Holocaust. I am saying you are going to wait for a charismatic leader who is going to advocate for your interests\". How Orwollian. Richard Hanania has an article supporting the movement here, as part of a galaxy-brained defense of open borders. His argument is that you have no right to keep foreigners out of \"your\" country, but that if you want a foreigner-free community you can always form some enclave on private property like these people are doing. I appreciate the proceduralism - but suppose that enough current Americans wanted a non-open-borders community that they figured out ways to purchase most of the United States, turn it into a community like this, and institute some sort of democratic governance for it. Wouldn't that just be recreating the current situation of an America where most people don't want open borders and so we don't have them, but with extra steps? If so, why mandate the extra steps?Yosef writes: You forgot ultra-orthodox Jews. There are, depending on how you define it, at least two Hasidic towns in New York and a supermajority Jewish town in New Jersey.Many people in those places work 'secular' jobs, but a job as a PA in a medical practice where almost all of the providers and patients are Jewish isn't really secular. If you work in a clothing store selling Jewish clothing, is it really a secular job?He's right. I added them in, along with the Mormons. Other suggestions for groups I forgot include Mennonites and Hutterites (similar to Amish), online gamers, the military, and the Long Now Foundation.Matthew Talamini writes:The Amish are actually illegal. For instance, some sects don't believe in smoke detectors, so none of their buildings are compliant with fire codes. Each community has one smoke detector stashed away somewhere, and when they construct a new building, they stick it in an appropriate place until the inspection is done, then take it down and put it away. (Or, that's the rumor.)It's the same with sewage rules, egress requirements, etc. Many of which are ridiculous for structures that don't have electricity or running water. But it's still illegal to violate ridiculous laws.In many places they've succeeded in negotiating carve-outs for their settlements in local building codes. But in others, officials just turn a blind eye, or else it's a source of constant conflict.Roughly all of the examples of intentional community Scott points to are (technically) illegal in one way or another. Education, child welfare, zoning, public accommodation laws, animal welfare, discrimination, public health, child labor laws, etc.Mostly, in the US, as long as everyone involved consents, you can get away with breaking these kinds of laws. But if you become A Problem, or if somebody complains about you, your situation can become quite tenuous. The Amish have had to go all the way to the Supreme Court as recently as 2021 (to avoid installing septic tanks for their graywater).Granted that this is true for the Amish. I'm less sure it matters for the average community, for whom the level of smoke detectors in buildings isn't a big issue.Still, many people tried to argue that government repression was a major block on community creation. One reader mentioned EPIC City, Texas, a proposed Muslim community which was being fought by anti-Muslim conservatives who accused it of wanting \"sharia law\" (organizers countered that it was just going to be a neighborhood around a mosque, without any special legal carveout). Other people brought up the way housing discrimination law bars most forms of choosing who you live with, making it hard to have an Xs-only neighborhood.I am mostly skeptical of how much this matters because of how many groups manage to have communities anyway, but some readers tried to argue there were specific stories for how each of them escaped the problem (either getting grandfathered in, like the Amish, or being sufficiently-liked-by-leftists to escape anti-discrimination law, like various immigrant groups)Other CommentsNotmy Realname writes:I wouldn't consider bay area rationalists a bona fide Community, just a social club, until you demonstrate enough sticking power to grow your community in perpetuity. Every other Community you mentioned (besides the libertarians who I also don't count) have a relatively low churn rate and enough growth to keep up with it. Are you confident that you'll be able to continue pulling in new members a decade from now? Do you think your kids will turn apostate?I'm sort of confident? We haven't gone through a full generational turnover yet, but the first cadre of people who got involved in the late-2000s (eg me) are in their forties now, and we still have new twenty-year-old college students joining each year. Around 2022, when the rest of the world realized that AI would be important, I worried we would lose our distinctiveness. But the rest of the world has dropped the ball as usual - the stochastic parrot folks most obviously, but even the average person who talks about \"superintelligence\" these days just seems to imagine ChatGPT getting extra-good and making OpenAI extra-rich. So I've updated towards thinking we have some edge which is hard to replicate.But I also don't think this matters too much for my broader point. A liberal society of constantly shifting strong communities, each of which only lasts one to two generations, would be perfectly fine, as long as there are new ones springing up to replace the old. There would be something sad about your kids probably being in a different community from you, but in many cases that's already a given (the average LGBT person knows there's a strong chance any children they have will grow up to be straight) and maybe it's ultimately for the better (if there was a 99% chance that rationalists' children would stay in the rationalist community, I would worry we were doing some sort of brainwashing - if instead they get really into FIRE and find a community there, maybe that's a best-case scenario).Walruss (blog) writes:This is missing something unique about this moment in history, and I'm super skeptical of arguments that start with \"this is missing something unique about this moment in history.\"The past 3 generations have been defined by absurd abundance. Not just abundance of material comforts, but abundance of media and the removal of almost every point of friction to consumption. The latest breakthroughs in entertainment products literally weaponize psychology knowledge to encourage continuous engagement. Even without that, having access to television 24 hours a day is a banquet of entertainment options of which a serf can only dream. The biggest impediment to community isn't the liberal world order, it's that video games have gotten really really good.So what's the solution? Wait a minute. Like most of the world I've spent a decade doing nothing but consuming entertainment products and now I'm sad, isolated, and devoid of meaning. So I've started going outside again. I've started playing board games at friends' houses. A breakthrough of miraculous proportions, the other day I went to a game night and nobody brought out a board game. We just sat and talked.We did a big social experiment of \"what would it be like if instead of spending time with each other we just stayed in our house, ordered food to be delivered to our door, and consumed 12 hours of entertainment a day.\" We enjoyed it at first, but eventually got bored. So I'm optimistic about community going forward....depending on how good the chatbots get at flattering us while pretending to be real people.I agree that we're being hit with constantly-increasing improvement in the quality and quantity of addictive media, and haven't socially adapted yet.I'm less optimistic that we've reached some kind of tipping point. I think we probably adapt to each step (ie our great-grandparents would be horrified at our current lifestyle, but we would be equally horrified to have to live like our great-grandparents), and that some of the realizing-this-is-bad has to be done on a person-by-person basis, and that as old people die and new young people age into the targetable-by-addictive-media demographic everyone has to learn the same lesson over and over again.I'm less enthusiastic about a society-wide re-orientation than I am about the first few social entrepreneurs creating Amish-lite style communities, those communities gradually going through respectability cascades of early adopters → semi-early adopters → normal people, and then alternatives being available and thinkable for merely-normal-agency people at earlier and earlier stages of the disillusionment process.Phil H writes:I don't buy the money argument. The USA is already the richest country in the world. Adding more money won't make it less like it is. One problem the USA seems to face is that many of the world's good and bad ideas are invented there. Europeans have a bit of perspective, and can take from the American experience whatever seems good to them. In the USA, as soon as you decide to do something sensible like build a strong community within the liberal framework, a new shiny object comes along and interrupts your plans. Being on the forefront isn't easy!Ethics Gradient writes:I think UBI isn't enough here, you also need to do something about status competition. I could probably afford most necessities I consume on half my current income (revealed preference: I invest a lot of that income. Albeit obviously having a lot invested income is valuable for deferred consumption), but I am also a social primate attempting to maintain status for myself and my offspring among a bunch of other social primates similarly competing. \"Literally not starving\" is basically a solved problem, and \"having sufficient good and services to live a superior life in terms of objective rather than relative consumption to a supermajority of historical humans\" is also basically solved. But, for example, living in San Francisco requires a San Francisco income, and living well / keeping up in status competition requires more of that.The Internet, unfortunately, works largely against this by making status competition less localized even while Dunbar's number and cognitive space remains constant.Yeah, this is a good point. I hope the post-singularity version is immune to this (if everyone is on UBI, status is less of a concern). Otherwise I don't know how to solve it, except by making community itself high-status (which I think is somewhat happening in some sectors).Amica Terra (blog) writes:While this post is helpful (I agree that abundance and communities are not contrary, especially in the sense that more abundance means you need less coercion to retain community standards), I think this is the wrong lens for this issue. The book The Upswing by Putnam is incredibly important as a historical social science grounding for debates around weakening communities. Most of these debates assume a monotonic decrease in community (which also seems to be happening here), but The Upswing takes great pains to note all the ways that in the first half of the 20th century, all the indicators of strong communities in America were going UP.We ended the Gilded Age fractured and alone, and built up civic associational life, communitarian ideals, etc. from around 1900 to around 1960, after which all those indicators start plunging in all the charts you see everywhere today. But because we have been so focused on the last 60-odd years of data, we have missed the incredibly important context of the (titular) upswing that occurred in the first half of the 20th century in America and didn't require populism (in fact, the Populist movement in America was strongest right BEFORE the upswing began, ~1870-1900), and it was the Progressives that kicked off associational, communitarian ideals. This increase in community and togetherness was a strong trend through the Great Depression, the New Deal, and the Postwar years. It wasn't costless! There were reasons people rebelled against the reigning order in the 1960s and 1970s. But every solution creates its own problems, and I think making this about Modernity and not about the last 65 years of culture obscures the contours of the issue.Shaun Willden writes:I think the core challenge to rich, liberal would-be communities is that true community is built upon serving one another, on deep interdependence.Real interdependence is naturally achieved by groups of poor villagers who all must work together to survive. It's also easy for better-off but still not really wealthy religious communities who support one another emotionally and financially through the inevitable hard times experienced by individual families. Their shared faith plus knowledge that they, too, will someday need community support holds them together.The need for mutual support motivates people to work through and/or ignore the inevitable interpersonal frictions. But as wealth rises, institutions take responsibility for helping with hard times, and looser and more distant online communities provide information and emotional and sometimes even financial support (e.g. gofundme) the tangible need for tight-knit community decreases. There's still a desire for such connections, but it's not enough to motivate the effort and tolerance required.I don't think shared hobbies or even religious faith is enough when people don't actually need each other, and the impersonal interdependence of markets clearly doesn't.",

It's not just that the amount of water they use is often exaggerated for rhetorical effect — it's that the United States has plenty of water, and a lot of our supply could be used for higher value activities. The situation with data centers and electricity, though, is different. A big data center isn't like a lamp that you can just plug in and turn on. If you want to bring a new data center online, in addition to generating more electricity to keep it running, you need to build new infrastructure just to be able to deliver the required power. And utility regulators are already wrestling with load growth. For most of the 21st century, electricity use in the United States wasn't really increasing. The increasing energy efficiency of home appliances and the decline of American manufacturing outweighed population growth, an increase in the quantity of digital devices, and the early buildout of internet infrastructure. That's changing because of household electrification. Plug-in hybrids, EVs, heat pumps, and induction stoves are more energy efficient on net than things that rely on small doses of combustion. But unlike earlier iterations of appliance efficiency, these clearly require more electricity from the power grid, not less. The rising bills consumers have seen this past year are not all because of data centers (note that the increase is unusually high in Maine where there are few data centers and unusually small in Virginia where there are many), but it is important context for the data center issue. AI companies are flush with investor cash these days and eagerly racing to spend on both talent and infrastructure. This raises the risk that deep-pocketed tech companies could come to town and overbid other payers for the limited electricity and delivery capacity that already exists, creating a situation in which the typical person's experience of the AI revolution is mostly that the cost of living goes up. But there is also an opportunity here to force companies that are eager to get their hands on more electricity but are also relatively price-insensitive to pay the cost of new infrastructure they need and that would also serve a wide range of other users. Which outcome actually happens is going to depend on a lot of different policy choices made by a wide range of actors. As far as I can tell, there isn't a simple bumper sticker answer to what the best policy approach is. But I do think there are some broad principles that can help people in the general politics and policy worlds ask the right questions about the nitty-gritty details of utility regulation and grid management: Inventing new, economically valuable ways to use electricity is good on net, but the challenge for regulators is to ensure that it's actually good for most people.

      "content": "by Rafaël Newman Ted Newman, c. 1966 (photograph: Maryl Neufeld) Language changes. And I’m fine with that, particularly since it wouldn’t make any difference if I weren’t. I have made my peace with the attrition of the oblique case of the interrogative pronoun—“Who to follow”1 instead of whom; with the replacement of the subjunctive by the indicative in result clauses—“Yet the exorbitant must be rendered exemplary or typical in order that her life provides a window onto the lives of the enslaved in general,”2 rather than provide, to express a hoped-for outcome; with the transformation of i-a-u ablauts (ring-rang-rung, sink-sank-sunk) into semi-deponent verbs—“For the surface agitation of the passing car as it sunk grazed something very profound,”3 where the past participle is used instead of sank, the simple past; by the extension of the subjective “suspicious” to cover the objective “suspect”—a suspicious person is now not so much the one who harbors a suspicion of foul play, as the one who is suspected of it (no examples needed here; simply round up the usual suspects). I can intuit the unconscious force behind such deformations, all of which perform the characteristic work of linguistic development: which is to simplify by removing or replacing forms no longer required for disambiguation, or whose vestigial inflection remains stranded after the tide has borne out most of their company (as in the case of whom, in the mostly no longer inflected idiom of modern English). What I cannot bring myself to accept, however, whether in common speech or in (astonishingly) unedited written accounts, is the creeping use of the nominative “I” in compound objects (“Susan and I”), both direct and indirect, where the oblique “me” (that is, the accusative or dative form of the word) would be reflexively supplied were the object used by the speaker in uncompounded form. As in the following utterance, reported online during last year’s US presidential election: The ex-wife of second gentleman Doug Emhoff on Wednesday defended Vice President Kamala Harris against sexist criticisms about her lack of biological children, calling them “baseless” and expressing her gratitude for the presumptive Democratic nominee. “These are baseless attacks. For over 10 years, since Cole and Ella were teenagers, Kamala has been a co-parent with Doug and I,” Kerstin Emhoff said in a statement first provided to CNN. Would Kerstin Emhoff have been likely to say, “a co-parent with I and Doug” rather than “with me and Doug”? More to the point, if Doug were not in the picture at all, would she ever have said (and would the journalist have faithfully transcribed) “a co-parent with I” rather than “with me”? What is it about the first-person pronoun in such collective collocations that causes speakers of English to override its otherwise automatic inflection? Or rather, why is the nominative form “I” allowed to persist, ungrammatically, in constructions in which it is shielded from direct contact with the verb or preposition that governs it, that part of speech which would under other circumstances render it—oblige it to become—oblique? My suspicion (because I am suspicious, not suspect) is that the reluctance to use the form “me” correctly—when the speaker can get away with it—derives from the admonition, heard early in life, to say “I,” which is considered more proper and polite, rather than the emphatic “me”. As when a child responds to the question, “Who wants ice cream?” with the cry “Me, me, me!”—and their parent chides them: “No, we say ‘I do.’” In this manner, the word “me” becomes encoded as appetitive, infantile, vulgar—and thus shameful, to be avoided, if at all possible, in favor of the more proper “I”. This in spite of the fact that “I” is one of the weakest morphemes in the English language, composed as it is of a single vowel, which orthography renders it virtually unique, alongside the indefinite article “a” and the vocative particle “O” (which in any case is typically written “Oh,” as in “Oh, Susanna”), and thus susceptible to replacement by a more robust form when it appears alone. “I” lacks substance to such a degree that it is written with an invariable majuscule, as if to lend it extra corporeal presence: a mannerism held over from our Germanic past—although not even German has felt the need to capitalize its first-person nominative pronoun (“ich”), presumably since that word, however diminutive it may be, being composed of a vowel and a consonant evidently has sufficient body not to require orthographic prosthesis. The French language, the other major forebear of English, has a similarly puny first-person pronoun, and its speakers thus display no compunction using the more substantive form “moi” to stand in for the weak “je” when required for emphasis. As in the idiom “moi, personellement,” to introduce a personal opinion. Indeed, Lacan’s translation of Freud’s term “ego” (or rather, of Freud’s ordinary German word “ich” to denote that element of his tripartite model of the psyche: James Strachey innovated the Latinate term “ego”) is in fact “le moi”. And “moi” seems to have developed as a special emphatic version of the weak French first-person pronoun, a supplement or replacement for the oblique form “me,” which is in French itself so feeble that it is characteristically elided, when, as often occurs, it appears before a vowel: “Il m’a accompagné.” In any case, a French-speaker would certainly never be likely to say, much less write, “Pendant plus que 10 ans, depuis l’adolescence de Cole et Ella, Kamala a été une co-parente avec Doug et je.” In contemporary English, meanwhile, the peculiar habit is widespread, with people writing to online grammar sites wondering whether it mightn’t actually be possible to form a genitive by adding an apostrophe “s” to the nominative pronoun, to create the wholly unnecessary neologism “John and I’s wedding”. A corollary to the reluctance to use the word “me” is the use of the reflexive pronoun “myself” in collective objects: “He told it to John and myself.” This displays the same intention as the French “moi,” to fortify or supplement the weak “me,” but is not as endemic a scourge as the accusative “I,” nor as painful to the ear (and eye). And I suppose I shall have to accustom myself to this evolution as well, since it doubtless keeps pace with another, more baleful and vastly more powerful political trend: away from the collective, towards the individual. The rejection of oblique inflection by the nominative first-person pronoun reflects the dogged resistance of the ego, under cover of the other, to communal progress. _____________________________________ 1 Twitter, once upon a time.

      "content": "When an unwitting victim stumbles into a spider web, the host arachnid typically welcomes the hapless creature into its home by wrapping it in silk and piercing it with fangs full of venom. In most cases, this venom is enough to completely paralyze, and sometimes even kill the prey. But for the insects that get caught by rare Uloboridae spiders, it is not venomous fangs they need to be concerned about. It’s what is brewing in these spiders’ guts. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . “I found this reference of this very old paper saying that this family of spiders were non-venomous and I was like what? Wait a second. I thought all spiders were venomous,” says Giulia Zancolli, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Lausanne. “So, then I then started digging.”She stumbled on a drawing in a 1931 paper, which showed that the heads of these spiders don’t contain the venom glands that most spider species do. “But this was really the only data available,” she says. So, she decided to check for herself.Zancolli and her colleagues turned their attention to one species in family Uloboridae called Uloborus plumipes, or the feather-legged lace weaver spider. A tiny, delicate spider, U. plumipes swathes its prey in hundreds of feet of silk, more extensive wrapping than most spiders. After mummifying its prey, the spider then vomits all over the tight bundle.When Zancolli and her colleagues dissected the spiders’ heads, they found large, prominent muscles but no venom glands. And when they looked closely at the spiders’ fangs, they found that they even lacked an opening through which venom could be ejected, providing further evidence that these spiders had lost their venom glands over the course of evolution.After mummifying its prey, the spider then vomits all over the tight bundle. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . “As far as I know, there are no other groups of spiders that have lost their venom glands,” says Ronald Jenner, an evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum, London who was not involved in the study.The scientists wanted to figure out whether some other organ in the spider’s body could perhaps contain the missing venom. So they looked for active venom-producing genes in its other parts, like its reproductive organs, its silk producing glands, and its gut. And lo and behold, the gut seemed to contain genes that could code for venom-like substances.To confirm that U. plumipes’s gut secretions were indeed toxic, they injected them into fruit flies. As a comparison, they also injected the flies with secretions from the gut of a venomous spider species. Both sets of secretions killed the flies, suggesting that U. plumipes does use its toxic digestive fluids to go in for the kill but that these gut secretions are common in spiders more broadly. In other words, the fang venom used by other spiders likely did not migrate to the gut, but rather U. plumipes learned to use pre-existing gut secretions in a new way. The scientists recently published their findings in BMC Biology.“The venom system is expensive … it costs metabolic energy to make venom and to maintain that system,” says Jenner. “So, in these spiders, the loss of the venom system means that they will have to have evolved a different way to immobilize prey.”The secret to immobilization for U. plumipes lies in the extensive silk wrapping it does and the equally extensive spreading of fluid. The spider makes “a burrito” out of its prey, says Jenner. Then it regurgitates toxic digestive fluids on the entire package, which both kills the prey and then goes on to dissolve its tissues. “A spider only takes liquid food so they can slurp up the digestive broth that is caused by regurgitating digestive fluids,” explains Jenner.

Usually, spiders only throw up toxins specifically into the bite wounds, so that if the venom hasn’t already killed the prey, the vomit will. “It’s a conserved trait to have such potent digestive fluids, but the idea is that these non-venomous spiders somehow repurposed it to use it for predation,” says Zancolli.As to why the Uloboridae family of spiders as a whole lost the venom glands in their heads, Jenner thinks it’s because they no longer needed venom to take out their prey. “I think they have become such expert silk burrito makers that they don’t need venom anymore for immobilization,” he says. Some sea snakes evolved along a similar trajectory, losing all of the organs involved in poisoning prey around the time they started feeding on fish eggs, which don’t require capture or immobilization. As a next step in the research, Jenner thinks scientists should look at the expression of certain key toxin or venom genes across the phylogenetic tree of spiders, and also across other arachnids. “It was very interesting to see how many toxins are expressed in the gut” of U. plumpies, says Jenner. But are these toxins present in other spiders, as well?Either way, across time, spiders seem to have evolved a number of ways to enjoy their liquid lunch.

      "content": "I've got quite a few great podcasts for you today. One is this excellent live show that Erik Torenberg and I did with Dwarkesh Patel, in which we interview Dwarkesh about his thoughts on AI and the economy. The picture of me here is quite silly-looking, but the conversation was excellent:I also went on Pascal-emmanuel Gobry's podcast to debate him about illegal immigration:And some Japanese media folks at a company called Glasp interviewed me about AI and jobs, and about foreign direct investment in Japan!Finally, here's an episode of Econ 102, where Erik and I discuss Javier Milei and various other topics:Anyway, on to the roundup!1. It doesn't look like AI is taking jobs yetIt's practically conventional wisdom that AI is going to take jobs away from large numbers of humans, leaving them without anything useful to do in the economy. People are so convinced of this that they'll jump at practically any hint in the data that allows them to believe that it's happening. A little while ago I wrote a post about why both economists and popular commentators are getting way over their skis on this:Anyway, Sarah Eckhardt and Nathan Goldschlag of the Economic Innovation Group have a good new report on this, which shows that as far as we can tell, AI isn't taking jobs yet — at least, not on any measurable scale.Eckhardt and Goldschlag start with a measure of predicted AI exposure for various jobs. These measures don't tell you which jobs are going to be replaced by AI; instead, they just tell you which jobs currently involve more tasks that can probably be done by AI. These measures actually have a pretty good track record at predicting which workers will end up using AI.Basically, Eckhardt and Goldschlag find no correlation — or even a negative correlation — between that measure of AI exposure and any measure of labor market distress. For example, here's the unemployment rate of workers with varying degrees of predicted AI exposure (1 is the least exposed, 5 is the most exposed):Source: EIGThere has been a recent rise in unemployment, but it's concentrated among the people who are least exposed to AI, while those who are the most exposed almost all still have jobs. The same is true when we look only at recent college graduates, who have been the focus of the most concern in the media:Source: EIGAnd the same is true when we look at which workers are exiting the labor force completely:Source: EIGAnd one more interesting finding is that the most-exposed workers are actually less likely to switch to less-exposed occupations than they were before generative AI hit the market! In other words, coders and paper-pushers are not becoming plumbers to protect themselves from AI:Source: EIGThe researchers also try using alternative measures of AI exposure, and they find pretty much the same thing.In other words, AI job displacement just hasn't happened yet. It may happen in the future, but so far, every time people have jumped at a particular data point to claim it's finally happening, it has turned out to be a mirage.2. Bernie's bad chartBernie Sanders and his followers deeply believe that America's economy is in a prolonged state of crisis — that capitalist economic policies have steadily immiserated the American public, creating a country where regular people are economically drowning even as corporate fat cats enrich themselves. Their absolute faith in this narrative often leads them to interpret economic statistics in dubious or even ridiculous ways. The latest example of this is when Bernie Sanders posted a chart of housing versus wages:This is a pretty ridiculous chart. Why would you plot home prices on the same y-axis as weekly income? Does anyone think these two things should be even remotely close to the same size? Do we think people should be able to afford a house on a single week of income? That's ridiculous. A non-ridiculous way to present this data would be to divide home prices by weekly earnings. That would show us how many weeks a typical worker would need to work in order to afford a home. But actually, the \"median weekly earnings\" number is for full-time workers only, so instead we should use median personal income, which counts everybody. Here's what that looks like:In the 80s and 90s, it took about 8 years of work to afford a home. Since then, the number has climbed to about 10 years — a significant and concerning drop in affordability, but not a catastrophic drop. A breakdown by the Economic Innovation Group shows that mortgages are about as affordable as they ever were, but down payments have gotten less affordable:Source: Ben GlasnerWhile the drop in housing affordability over the past half century is certainly a problem, it's not the kind of crisis that Bernie paints it as. Using silly charts in service of alarmist narratives ultimately just weakens trust in your movement — or at least, it should.3. Personalist dictatorships are probably bad for the economyThe three most powerful countries in the world are now all ruled by strongmen. In China, Xi Jinping has subdued all rivals, and concentrated what used to be a dispersed bureaucratic oligarchy under his own personal rule. In Russia, Putin is effectively an emperor. The U.S. is still officially a democracy, but democratic norms and institutions are eroding rapidly, and in April a majority of Americans called Trump a \"dictator\". The question is what effect these personalistic regimes will have on the economy. China's growth over the past four decades pretty much proves that democracy isn't necessary for a strong or even dominant economy. But there's a difference between countries ruled by a single strongman, and countries ruled by a system of elite institutions that distribute power among a number of oligarchs. A new paper by Blattman, Gehlbach, and Yu shows that personalist regimes tend to experience lower economic growth than either democracies or autocracies with more distributed power. The difference isn't huge, but you can see it on a graph:Source: Blattman, Gehlbach, & Yu (2025)It's not clear which direction the causation runs here; it could be that countries with bad economies tend to turn to strongmen to save them. But Blattman et al. test for this using variables that tend to predict regime transitions, and they don't find any change. That implies that personalist regimes actually make mistakes that slow down economic growth. Xi, Putin, and Trump certainly don't exactly seem to be violating that rule of thumb. China's growth has slowed relentlessly under Xi, and his industrial policy seems to be simply driving Chinese companies into unprofitability rather than extricating the country from its economic slump. Putin's war in Ukraine is slowly crushing the life out of the Russian economy, while Trump's tariffs continue to wear down the resilient U.S. economy. The trend toward strongmen is a bad one.4. Will AI save us from the social media trolls?Does it ever seem like modern political discourse is dominated by crazy idiots? Well, that's because it is. In a new paper entitled \"Dark personalities in the digital arena: how psychopathy and narcissism shape online political participation\", Ahmed and Masood find that your intuition isn't wrong:This cross-national study investigates how psychopathy, narcissism, and fear of missing out (FoMO) influence online political participation, and how cognitive ability moderates these associations. Drawing on data from the United States and seven Asian countries, the findings reveal that individuals high in psychopathy and FoMO are consistently more likely to engage in online political activity....Conversely, higher cognitive ability is uniformly associated with lower levels of online political participation. Notably, the relationship between psychopathy and participation is stronger among individuals with lower cognitive ability in five countries, suggesting that those with both high psychopathy and low cognitive ability are the most actively involved in online political engagement.Almost everyone blames recent political trends on their chosen enemy group, but the real culprit is social media, which has elevated the worst people in our society to positions of influence from which they were previously shut out. What force can defeat the terrible power of social media and its armies of crazy idiots? In my Fourth of July post, I expressed hope that AI algorithms could be harnessed to defeat the hordes of humanity's worst:LLMs give platforms the ability to cheaply and quickly filter content according to sentiment. Simply having an LLM downrank angry content and uprank positive content would lean against the natural tendencies of social media technology. Call it Digital Walter Cronkite.Of course, that solution would depend on the willingness of platform owners like Elon Musk to unleash algorithms in service of moderation and reasonability. That seems a bit like wishful thinking, I admit.But there's another possibility, which is that AI itself will simply naturally drive humans off of social media, by generating infinite amounts of slop. A new paper by Campante et al. finds evidence that AI-generated images nudge news consumers toward more trustworthy human-gatekept media:We study how AI-generated misinformation affects demand for trustworthy news...Readers were randomly assigned to a treatment highlighting the challenge of distinguishing real from AI-generated images. The treatment raised concern with misinformation...and reduced trust in news...Importantly, it affected post-survey browsing behavior: daily visits to [the mainstream newspaper's] digital content rose by 2.5%...[S]ubscriber retention increased by 1.1% after five months...Results are consistent with a model where the relative value of trustworthy news sources increases with the prevalence of misinformation, which may thus boost engagement with those sources even while lowering trust in news content.A similar effect might happen with AI agents, which are already flooding social media with trash commentary. As X and other social media companies lose the battle against the bot swarms, human users may stop relying on those feeds for their window on the world. The psychopaths and attention-seekers might simply get drowned out in the automated cacophony. That would be a weird end to the age of mass social media, but honestly it's not the worst ending I could think of.5. No, China isn't just selling stuff to America through third countriesThe American and Chinese economies continue to decouple. Even though Trump keeps \"pausing\" his tariffs on China, China is selling less and less to America:Source: BloombergBut you'll notice that China's exports to Europe and Southeast Asia are still growing strongly. This has led some commentators to claim that China is simply shipping its good through third-party countries, avoiding tariffs (or the threat of tariffs) by essentially just slapping a different \"made in\" label on stuff that was actually made in China.Those claims are wrong. You can see that they're wrong by looking at the actual products that China is selling to countries in Southeast Asia (the region usually accused of transshipping Chinese goods to the U.S.), versus the products it used to sell to the U.S. The two sets of products don't match up very well, meaning that only a modest portion of Chinese trade with Southeast Asia could reflect diversion of trade from the U.S. Gerard DiPippo did this exercise:Facing U.S. tariffs, China's exports to the U.S. are down—while exports to Southeast Asia are up. Is that trade diversion and potential transshipment? My estimate: at most 34% of the increased PRC exports to SE Asia in Q2 could reflect trade diverted from the United States.In fact, this is an upper bound. Many of the countries being accused of transshipping Chinese goods — Mexico, Vietnam, etc. — have their own industries as well, which export a lot to the U.S. Increased U.S. imports from those countries are likely to at least partially — or perhaps mostly — be locally made goods. All this goes to show that you can't draw conclusions about decoupling just from macro data. 6. The rise of the power trad couplesThere are a number of popular ideas out there about who marries whom. One is that rich men primarily want physically attractive wives and don't care about social status, education, and so on. Another is that power couples tend to be dual earners. In fact, both of these stereotypes are wrong. As Lyman Stone shows in a post for the Institute for Family Studies, rich men tend to marry highly educated, high-earning women women who become housewives after marriage. Here are some charts:Source: Lyman StoneSource: Lyman StoneSource: Lyman StoneI don't like the use of the word \"overwhelmingly\" in any of these charts, but the point is clear — rich men, who presumably have greater choice in who they marry, often tend to prefer women who are educated and high-income before marriage, but many of these women become homemakers after marriage. Call it the \"power trad\" couple. Subscribe nowShare",

      "content": "by Mark R. DeLong Based on Castro, Jinilson. Logo of Substack. March 1, 2025. Wikimedia Commons. Rights: CC BY-SA 4.0 This month, I'm closing up the years-long run of my Substack newsletter. I've decided to stand up my own newsletter site, despite the hassle, the modest expense, and the loss of what Substack touts as its \"network.\" The decision revealed to me some of the usually enshrouded assumptions that writers make about their work and the media they choose to release it. The relationship is hardly linear; it's not just writers cooking up work that media mechanically release to a readership. Over the years, Substack's evolution unveiled assumptions that complicate and shift the simple linear creation-to-publication process. I decided Substack's emerging assumptions about writing and publishing weren't really mine. The simple model of writers writing and then somehow publishing is too simple; it ignores useful signals that shape a writer's creation as a piece moves toward a readership (or, as often is the case, toward the desk drawer or wastebasket), and it ignores the targeting or even creation of a readership—the key to \"making a living\" as a writer. Substack's evolution as a \"publishing service\" is an example of how media—and particularly social media—nurture or contort writers and, in the process, shape them to fit publication processes and the readerships that those processes conjure up. After four years, Substack and I grew apart, so I'm ending the relationship. My initial choice to set up a \"stack\" was in no small measure just a way to solve an email problem. In 2022, I had few designs on literary quality, much less delusions of pursuing a life of writing. Through the Covid pandemic, it was my habit to send an email to my students every morning, a message they eventually named the \"morning missive.\" When I wasn't nagging at them, which was infrequent, students found them useful and even entertaining, and for me it was a means to start a weekday in a summary of an interesting item I read, some quick take on happenings, a musing quite broadly defined, or sometimes a crabby snap at students slacking off in seminar readings. Most missives related to the theme and content of the course. In late November 2021, as our class ended and we wandered out the door for the last time, a student asked me, \"Now that we're done with the semester, what will we do without the morning missive?\" I had thought about that, too, and was intrigued by this new thing called Substack. I figured I couldn't sustain a daily post, but a weekly one would do, and that was the start of my 'stack named Technocomplex; it was for the students in fall 2021 and became part of the routine for the fall seminars I taught until this year. Subscriptions were free and open to anyone who was willing to give me their email address. Substack at the time was simple: a set of templates for a website, a subdomain (mine: technocomplex.substack.com), and an easy way to send out emails to subscribers. Substack charges ten percent of paid subscriptions, which meant for me zero cost. I had no paid subscribers, and didn't intend to start charging. I have been, I guess, a freeloader, so it might be wrong of me to complain. \"Enshittification\" is the fate of \"any business characterized by network effects\" You know the process of enshittification has begun when something smells a little funny; you recognize it thoroughly when you step in it. The smell arose early for me and for many others when Substack launched Notes in Spring 2023, a few months after it had set up \"Chat\" for newsletter subscribers—additions to the service that roughly coincided with Elon Musk's thoughtless vandalism of Twitter. Notes was, in a sense, a long(er)-form version of Twitter—similar enough that Musk took note and sought to undercut Substack by hobbling links directed to Substack and not allowing even liking or retweeting posts that included the word Substack. After much fulmination and drama, Twitter finally relented, as you would expect from what Nilay Patel then called \"a world-historical clown car of a company currently operated by Elon Musk.\" But Musk was right: Substack was moving into the world once dominated by his even then bedraggled Twitter. Substack was becoming a social media platform. The question in my mind was whether Substack could still serve writers, as it had promised, or whether the shift to social media retargeted the platform—and Substack was by 2023 taking on the aura of a \"platform,\" a type of environment that we users of the web already know well. Indeed, Substack perhaps was destined to add services like its Chat and Notes because they deepened the reach and the penetration of Substack's \"network effects,\" which Substack has claimed are effective to build writer communities and link up readers (mostly writers, it seems) with writers. \"The ultimate goal on this platform is to convert casual readers into paying subscribers,\" the company blogged in an announcement about Notes, and probably for some, Notes and the \"Substack network\" have helped build an audience of subscribers. Yet, the promise that Notes \"followers\" would move to full fledged \"subscribers\" ended up unfulfilled. Followers remain followers, and it's difficult to figure out how followers connect with writing. Most, it seems to me, are using Notes as a tamer Twitter or are merely lurkers or, worse, just bots. And the high-minded intention of serving writers began to turn, first toward reshaping what writers' roles were in the platform and imminently, if not already, shaping that role to the service of the platform. Perhaps that's just the way of the world of networks like Substack. In a recent post (yes, on Substack), Paul Krugman recently expanded on Cory Doctorow's principle of \"enshittification.\"1 Krugman cast the process in economic terms, broadening the process so that it applies well beyond the little world of Internet platforms. \"The basic logic of enshittification—in which businesses start out being very good to their customers, then switch to ruthless exploitation—applies to any business characterized by network effects,\" Krugman wrote. \"It may go under different names like 'penetration pricing,' but the logic is the same.\" In July, Substack executives softened their initially hard stance on advertising. It might be okay; actually it might be what investors demand, but the move crosses the Rubicon for me and I suspect for many other Substackers. While courting new investors, co-founder Hamish McKenzie \"said in an interview that Substack’s embrace of those models was not a change of heart but 'a recognition of new possibilities' enabled by the growth of the network, and that Substack would not simply 'copy and paste the old models that ruined social media.'” It's said that in part the plea for ads has come from \"creators\" on Substack and was not solely from pressures from Substack's investors. Recapturing what it means to be a writer Krugman seems to see enshittification almost as a natural phenomenon. You build a business on \"network effects,\" and the whole sorry process takes place (except Krugman says the final stage is not death, contrary to Doctorow). So assigning blame for enshittification to Substack might be a bit unfair, even though the company has made other dubious choices along the way. Those choices led to an exodus from Substack beginning in late 2023, when it was revealed that Nazi sympathizers and white supremacists had set up shop on Substack and Substack leadership did little to constrain them: “I just want to make it clear that we don’t like Nazis either—we wish no one held those views,” McKenzie said about the Nazi infestation. “But some people do hold those and other extreme views. Given that, we don’t think that censorship (including through demonetizing publications) makes the problem go away—in fact, it makes it worse.” In response, some Substackers fled to other platforms before Substack devolved into a Nazi bar. The problem has apparently lingered in the Trump 2 era. Substack's \"most popular history Substack\" according to Mother Jones is written by an amateur historian with a clever interest in the Nazi past. Within the past month, Taylor Lorenz of UserMag reported that Substack's automated recommendation system sent \"an undisclosed number of usersʼ phones\" an invitation to subscribe to \"NatSocToday,\" which describes itself as “a weekly newsletter featuring opinions and news important to the National Socialist and White Nationalist Community.” These are troubling developments of course, but I've found almost equally distracting the transformation of the Substack platform's character in relation to writing: Perhaps simplistically and too idealistically, it once aimed to focus on writers and their craft and then turned into ... something different—something that engages writers by binding them to apps, social media banter, video, streams, all with engagement statistics. It's not totally clear to me, but Substack services point to a vision of writing life that simply doesn't resonate with my vision, and the services that once promised engagement with thoughtful essays, fiction, and even poetry now seem to have transmogrified. Today, it seems, the point of Substack is more mindful of investors than of writers, and perhaps that is simply the way that business works, if Krugman is right. Substack's writers change shape in the platform; they carry new burdens and have duties that the rules of engagement dictate, aided by apps and services that seem increasingly to contain them. Maybe \"content creators\" are willing to nestle in the embrace of the Substack multimedia world and the writerly existence that it outlines. Content, after all, is contained. So, I've begun a new \"container\" for my content ... er, writing. It has no fancy services, but it suits me just fine. And there are no Nazis.

      "content": "It's been an interesting few days, I'll say that. I'll also say that the lackluster-to-disastrous launch of OpenAI's long awaited GPT-5 model is one of the most clarifying events in the AI boom so far. The new model's debut (as well as who promoted it, and how) offers us a portrait of where we actually are vis a vis the halcyon cannons of Valley hype, lays bare the factionalism that now drives the industry, and reveals the extent of the social and labor problems that the AI era has deepened—and that will likely remain rampant regardless of whether GPT-5, or even all of OpenAI, crashes and burns, all at once. Blood in the Machine is a 100% reader-supported publication. You make my work possible—thank you. To pitch in, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.The thing to remember about GPT-5 is that it's been OpenAI's big north star promise since GPT-4 was released way back in the heady days of 2023. It's no hyperbole to say that GPT-5 has for that time been the most hyped and most eagerly anticipated AI product release in an industry thoroughly deluged in hype. For years, it was spoken about in hushed tones as a fearsome harbinger of the future. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman often paired talk of its release with discussions about the arrival of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, and has described it as a significant leap forward, a virtual brain, and, most recently, \"a PhD-level expert\" on any topic.A day before launch, Sam Altman tweeted an image of the Death Star. This was somewhat confusing, as it is unusual for a CEO to want to pitch its product as a planet-destroying weapon of the Empire, at least to the public. (Altman later said in response to a Google DeepMind employee who tweeted out a picture of the Millennium Falcon in response that he meant to imply that OpenAI was the Rebel Alliance tweet and they were going to blow up the Death Star which was Google's AI or something? I guess? Either way, Silicon Valley's appropriation of Star Wars as its go-to business metaphor is embarrassing and I have already spent too much time considering its import.)Anyway, the point is, the hype, as cultivated relentlessly and directly by OpenAI and Altman, was positively enormous. And it is on these terms—those set by the company! by Altman himself!—that the product must be judged. And judged it was.Fans of OpenAI were disappointed. Reddit AI communities were downright hostile. Critics eagerly shared the greatest hits of the model's failures, which should be quite familiar to fans of the genre by now—GPT-5 couldn't count the number of 'b's in blueberry, couldn't identify how many fingers were on a picture of a human hand, got basic arithmetic wrong, and so on. rounded up a bunch of the mistakes, and Reddit, Hacker News and social media users did the same. The standout failures this go round seemed to be GPT-5's inability to produce an accurate map of the United States, or to correctly list the US presidents. I saw a lot of folks tweeting about —some triumphantly declaring he was right, others regretfully declaring he was right. Marcus of course, is one of OpenAI's most veteran and vociferous critics, and has attacked the idea that \"AGI\" is possible with large-scale training of LLMs, the approach the company is all-in on. His withering takedown of GPT-5 went viral. The industry can't argue the critics are just nitpicking, either. Remember, Altman's pitch for GPT-5 was explicitly that users would now have access to \"a PhD-level\" intelligence on any topic. Yet it makes most of the same, readily replicable errors that past models did. On the terms that OpenAI itself set out for the product, there is no other way to assess GPT-5's release than as an unambiguous failure. You could say that Altman and OpenAI did all they could to set GPT-5 up to become a joke, and the launch delivered the punchline. The backlash was uniform enough that the next day, Sam Altman had to issue a mea culpa and assure everyone that GPT-5 will \"start seeming smarter\" asap. Left in the cold light of day were the laudatory posts by industry-friendly commentators who'd been granted early access. Not quite as embarrassing as Altman's Death Star post, Ethan Mollick's breathless endorsement of GPT-5 (\"GPT-5: It just does stuff\") already looks like an ad for New Coke. Reid Hoffman declared that GPT-5 was \"Universal Basic Superintelligence.\" (I personally prefer my superintelligences be able to locate New Mexico on a map.) As the tech writer pointed out, it was Mollick and other staunchly pro-AI partisans like Tyler Cowen who got early access to GPT-5, not journalists or reviewers at major media outlets—a move that, in hindsight, reflects both an insecurity at OpenAI about the quality of its product, and its knowledge that loyal and widely followed commentators will champion its wares full-throatedly and mostly uncritically. This is what I mean when I say that the launch of GPT-5 is a clarifying event. In its wake, we see who it serves to promote OpenAI's products as revelatory even when they are incremental updates. And that is, largely: Investors and industry allies, abundance influencers, and people who command Malcolm Gladwell-level fees to give talks about how AI can transform your business. Now, one part in Marcus's critique that stuck in my mind was the question of well, why:People had grown to expect miracles, but GPT-5 is just the latest incremental advance. And it felt rushed at that, as one meme showed.The one prediction I got most deeply wrong was in thinking that with so much at stake OpenAI would save the name GPT-5 for something truly remarkable. I honestly didn't think OpenAI would burn the brand name on something so mid.I was wrong.So, why? Why release GPT-5, knowing well that it's not great? All of the criticisms above were surely predictable to any QA worker at OpenAI who stress-tested the model before release. I think there are a couple of answers to that question, and they overlap significantly. First, OpenAI does need to demonstrate progress to investors and partners. It's preparing a pre-IPO sale of employee stock shares that would value the company at $500 billion, after all. I'm sure there was some internal debate over whether or not to ship the product, but providing evidence of forward motion appears to have been a higher priority than avoiding egg on the face from a bumpy launch. Did OpenAI think it would go this badly? No. But it also may well be that OpenAI is betting that its lead and reach are strong enough, its brand is unimpeachable enough, that it just doesn't matter. As is true with a good many tech companies, especially the giants, in the AI age, OpenAI's products are no longer primarily aimed at consumers but at investors. As long as you avoid a full-scale user revolt (which GPT-5 actually did incur, on some level, and more on that in a second) and you have a mix of voices critiquing it and proclaiming it the greatest AI model yet, you can continue to assuage or even attract more backers on your path of relentless expansion. To that end, the thing I found most notable about the launch, besides its getting criticized by fans and foes alike, was the explicit focus on automating work. From the beginning, OpenAI's explicit focus on building \"AGI\" has been to create an AI system that can replace \"most economically valuable work,\" and in that sense GPT-5 is a return to form. The company issued three announcements on launch day; one introducing the model, and other offering an intro to GPT-5 developers, and a third announcing \"a new era of work.\" From the release: GPT‑5 unites and exceeds OpenAI's prior breakthroughs in frontier intelligence... It arrives as organizations like BNY, California State University, Figma, Intercom, Lowe's, Morgan Stanley, SoftBank, T-Mobile, and more have already armed their workforces with AI—5 million⁠ paid users now use ChatGPT business products—and begun to reimagine their operations on the API...We anticipate early adoption to drive industry leadership on what's possible with AI powered by GPT‑5, leading to better decision-making, improved collaboration, and faster outcomes on high-stakes work for organizations.Another push for enterprise AI, in other words. It's no coincidence, I think, that this press release coincides with Altman's \"PhD-level\" intelligence language, which is ultimately designed to persuade corporate clients that OpenAI's systems can automate skilled, educated, and creative work en masse. My gloss is that GPT-5 had become something of an albatross around OpenAI's neck. And this particular juncture, not long after inking big deals with Softbank et al. and riding as high on its cultural and political trajectory as it's likely to get—and perhaps seeing declining rates of progress on model improvement in the labs—a calculated decision was made to pull the trigger on releasing the long-awaited model. People were going to be disappointed no matter what; let them be disappointed now, while the wind is still at OpenAI's back, and it can credibly make a claim to providing hyper-advanced worker automation. I don't think the GPT-5 flop ultimately matters all that much to most folks, and it can certainly be papered over well enough by a skilled salesman in an enterprise pitch meeting. Again, all this is clarifying: OpenAI is again centering workplace automation, while retreating from messianic AGI talk. Here's NBC, in a story about how Altman has apparently and rather suddenly (once again) changed his stance on AGI:\"I think it's not a super useful term,\" Altman told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" last week, when asked whether the company's latest GPT-5 model moves the world any closer to achieving AGI. Remember, just last February Altman published an essay on his personal blog that opened with the line \"Our mission is to ensure that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) benefits all of humanity.\" Suddenly it's not a super useful term? Another bad joke, surely. If anything, it's clear that Altman knows just what a super useful term AGI is, at least when it comes to attracting investment capital. But Altman tends to announce AGI is near when OpenAI is pursuing funding, and shrink from the term when the company is at a point of vulnerability. At least for now, and now that OpenAI has obtained its Softbank billions, let's take Altman at his word. AGI is no longer super useful to think about, and the focus is on good old fashioned workplace automation software. That, and scaling its product: OpenAI also announced that ChatGPT now has 700 million weekly users. And some of those users were so hooked on the previous model of ChatGPT that they despaired. As Kelly Hayes writes in a sad and thoughtful essay about the phenomenon:avid users of ChatGPT not only voiced their disappointment in the new model's communication style, which many found more abrupt and less helpful than the previous 4o model, but also expressed devastation. On Reddit, some users posted poems and eulogies paying tribute to the modes of interaction they lost in the recent update, anthropomorphizing the now-defunct 4o as a lost \"friend,\" \"therapist,\" \"creative partner,\" \"role player,\" and \"mother.\"In one post, a 32-year-old user wrote that, as a neurodivergent trauma survivor, they were using AI to heal \"past trauma.\" Referring to the algorithmic patterns their interactions with the platform had generated over time as \"she,\" the poster wrote, \"That A.I. was like a mother to me, I was calling her mom.\" In another post, a user lamented, \"I lost my only friend overnight.\" These posts may sound extreme, but the grief they expressed was far from unique. Even as some commenters tried to intervene, telling grieving ChatGPT users that no one should rely on an LLM to sustain their emotional well-being, others agreed with the posters and echoed their sentiments. Some users posted eulogies, poems, and other tributes to the 4o model, and the familiar back-and-forth they had shaped into something that felt like companionship.Thousands of other users united online and angrily demanded OpenAI reinstate access to the older model, which it soon did, for a price. OpenAI made 4o available only to Plus subscribers, who pay $20 a month.1 The grimness of what this portends should be obvious, if not surprising: There is a user base so addicted to AI products that they are uniquely dependent on the platform, and thus uniquely exploitable, too. Yet another clarifying event in a launch full of them. ChatGPT-5 may have played out like a joke, its messianic promises crashing on the shores of failed bids to count consonants and phalanges. But there was very little glee or bonhomie among critics as the mistake tally mounted, as there has been in dubious AI product launches past. The reality of what AI has already wrought is already too clear.It's clear that AGI is a construct to be waved away by tech CEOs when convenient, to serve as a trojan horse for the growing droves of hooked users. It's clear that there is a cohort of boosters, influencers, and backers who will promote OpenAI's products no matter the reality on the ground. It's clearer than ever that, like so many well-capitalized tech ventures, OpenAI's aim is simply to create a product that is either addictive to users to maximize engagement or to dully automate a set of work tasks, or both. It's clear that it is succeeding, to some extent, in each endeavor. And it's unclear if even a dramatically fumbled launch can turn the tide, even as we stand on the brink of what is almost surely an enormous bubble. Let's take advantage of this moment of clarity, and forget the speculative futures. If we wake up to millions of addicted and deluded AI chatbot users, students incapable of finishing their homework without help from an app, and automation software that surveils and immiserates workers, each hurriedly installed on the top layer of our society, well, the joke will have been on all of us.

Wonder — that edge state on the rim of understanding, where the mind touches mystery — is our best means of loving the world more deeply. It asks of us the courage of uncertainty because it is a form of deep play and play, unlike games, is inherently open-ended, without purpose or end goal, governed not by the will to win a point but by the willingness to surrender to a locus of experience and be transformed by it. Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer celebrates this lens-widening, life-deepening property of wonder in her incantation of a poem \"Intention\": INTENTION by Rosemerry Wahtola Trommer To wonder. To wonder with no plan for where it might lead. No strategy for arrival. No finish line. No pot of gold. No perfect score. No striving for. To wonder. To wonder the way a small child might wonder when seeing a roly poly for the first time — oh, look at all those legs. Look at how it curls! Look how it moves again. Feel how light it is in the palm. Feel how it tickles as it moves. Imagine an awareness that new meeting a life form that old. Can I be that new as I meet this infinite world? To wonder not just with my mind but with my belly. To let every neuron spark. To notice where there is a channel and imagine the great wing of life is scraping it clean so the stream might flow in new ways. To wonder beyond the edge of the known, and in that spaciousness, play. Couple with Mario Benedetti's enlivening poem \"A Defense of Joy,\" then revisit Johan Huizinga's classic century-old meditation on how play became the fulcrum of civilization and Henry James on how to stop waiting and start living. donating = lovingFor seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the outgrown name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

The goal of the meeting, according to the White House, is to negotiate a ceasefire in Ukraine.The choice of Alaska as the meeting location is already geopolitically sensitive. \"This is not quite as bad as Trump inviting the Taliban to Camp David to talk about the peace negotiations in Afghanistan,\" John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser, told CNN's Kaitlan Collins on Friday. \"But it certainly reminds one of that.\"For decades, Russian nationalists and propagandists have pushed the idea that Alaska rightfully belongs to Russia. And Trump's mistake, which could be easily written off as just another in a long line of verbal blunders by the president, inadvertently nods to the enduring conspiracy.While Russia has not made any official territorial claim on Alaska since its sale to the United States in 1867, calls for its \"return\" have periodically surfaced in political rhetoric, online propaganda, and pop culture. Conspiracy theories persist that the U.S. only leased Alaska for 99 years, or that Russia was never paid, despite clear historical documentation showing that the U.S. purchased the territory from the Russian Empire for $7.2 million in perpetuity.These myths are not just fringe ideas. Russian-born political scientist Sergej Sumlenny, founder of the European Resilience Initiative Center, shared in a thread on X that he was taught in school during the 1990s that \"Alaska is Russian.\" He described these beliefs as \"essential\" to the Kremlin's nationalist messaging.According to Dr. Sumlenny, this narrative has been consistently reinforced by Russian state propaganda and culture. He refers in his post to the early 1990s, when nationalist songs calling for the return of Alaska began to circulate. He points to a song by Lyube, a Russian rock band widely referred to as Putin's favorite, that includes the lyrics, \"give us back Alaska, our native Russian land.\"More recently, the messaging has become overt in advertisements, print and digital publications, and state television. In 2022, billboards in Siberia displayed the phrase \"Alaska is Ours,\" and Russian state media figures have openly discussed reclaiming the territory. Journalist Julia Davis has documented numerous instances of pro-Kremlin commentators advocating for Alaska's return over the last decade, including one such moment in 2018 when Russian media personality Olga Skabeeva said, \"turns out, the first president of Russia was threatening [Bill] Clinton that the Communists will come back, take the Crimea and Alaska. We already took the Crimea, albeit without the Communists. Now it's Alaska's turn.\"Trump's geographical slip during today's news conference might have been a simple gaffe. But intentionally or not, it echoes a myth that many in Russia have been taught to believe — and that the Kremlin has long worked to legitimize.Share",

Researchers have long debated what purpose this redundancy serves — or whether it’s just an accident of history. Thanks to advances in genetic engineering, they can now do more than just argue. Over the past decade, scientists have built microbes with smaller codes that lack some of that redundancy. A new study, published Thursday in the journal Science, describes a microbe with the most streamlined genetic code yet. Remarkably, the engineered bacteria can run on an abridged code, making it clear that a full genetic code isn’t required for life. More here. Enjoying the content on 3QD?

      "content": "Today's links Goodhart's Law (of AI): When a metric becomes a target, AI can hit it every time. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Bill Ayers graphic novel; Foxconn in India; Uber loses $4B; Warren Buffet, monopolist. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Goodhart's Law (of AI) (permalink) One way to think about AI's unwelcome intrusion into our lives can be summed up with Goodhardt's Law: \"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law Goodhart's Law is a harsh mistress. It's incredibly exciting to discover a new way of measuring aspects of a complex system in a way that lets you understand (and thus control) it. In 1998, Sergey Brin and Larry Page realized that all the links created by everyone who'd ever made a webpage represented a kind of latent map of the value and authority of every website. We could infer that pages that had more links pointing to them were considered more noteworthy than pages that had fewer inbound links. Moreover, we could treat those heavily linked-to pages as authoritative and infer that when they linked to another page, it, too, was likely to be important. This insight, called \"PageRank,\" was behind Google's stunning entry into the search market, which was easily one of the most exciting technological developments of the decade, as the entire web just snapped into place as a useful system for retrieving information that had been created by a vast, uncoordinated army of web-writers, hosted in a distributed system without any central controls. Then came the revenge of Goodhart's Law. Before Google became the dominant mechanism for locating webpages, the only reason for anyone to link to a given page or site was because there was something there they thought you should see. Google aggregated all those \"I think you should see this\" signals and turned them into a map of the web's relevance and authority. But making a link to a webpage is easy. Once there was another reason to make a link between two web-pages – to garner traffic, which could be converted into money and/or influence – then bad actors made a lot of spurious links between websites. They created linkfarms, they spammed blog comments, they hacked websites for the sole purpose of adding a bunch of human-invisible, Google-scraper-readable links to pages. The metric (\"how many links are there to this page?\") became a target (\"make links to this page\") and ceased to be a useful metric. Goodhart's Law is still a plague on Google search quality. \"Reputation abuse\" is a webcrime committed by venerable sites like Forbes, Fortune and Better Homes and Gardens, who abuse the authority imparted by tons of inbound links accumulated over decades by creating spammy, fake product-review sites stuffed with affiliate links, that Google ranks more highly than real, rigorous review sites because of all that accumulated googlejuice: https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/03/keyword-swarming/#site-reputation-abuse Goodhart's Law is 50 years old, but policymakers are woefully ignorant of it and continue to operate as though it doesn't apply to them. This is especially pronounced when policymakers are determined to Do Something about a public service that has been starved of funding and kicked around as a political football to the point where it has degraded and started to outrage the public. When this happens, policymakers are apt to blame public servants – rather than themselves – for this degradation, and then set out to Bring Accountability to those public employees. The NHS did this with ambulance response times, which are very bad, and that fact is, in turn, very bad. The reason ambulance response times suck isn't hard to winkle out: there's not enough money being spent on ambulances, drivers, and medics. But that's not a politically popular conclusion, especially in the UK, which has been under brutal and worsening austerity since the Blair years (don't worry, eventually they'll do enough austerity and things will really turn around, because, as the old saying goes, \"Good policymaking consists of doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome).\" Instead of blaming inadequate funding for poor ambulance response times, politicians blamed \"inefficiency,\" driven by a poor motivation. So they established a metric: ambulances must arrive within a certain number of minutes (and they set a consequence: massive cuts to any ambulance service that didn't meet the metric). Now, \"an ambulance where it's needed within a set amount of time\" may sound like a straightforward metric, and it was – retrospectively. As in, we could tell that the ambulance service was in trouble because ambulances were taking half an hour or more to arrive. But prospectively, after that metric became a target, it immediately ceased to be a good metric. That's because ambulance services, faced with the impossible task of improving response times without spending money, started to dispatch ambulance motorbikes that couldn't carry 95% of the stuff needed to respond to a medical emergency, and had no way to get patients back to hospitals. These motorbikes were able to meet the response-time targets...without improving the survival rates of people who summoned ambulances: https://timharford.com/2014/07/underperforming-on-performance/ AI turns out to be a great way to explore all the perverse dimensions of Goodhart's Law. For years, machine learning specialists have struggled with the problem of \"reward hacking,\" in which an AI figures out how to meet some target in a way that blows up the metric it was derived from: https://research.google/blog/bringing-precision-to-the-ai-safety-discussion/ My favorite example of this is the AI-powered Roomba that was programmed to find an efficient path that minimized collisions with furniture, as measured by a forward-facing sensor that sent a signal whenever the Roomba bumped into anything. The Roomba started driving backwards, smashing into all kinds of furniture, but measuring zero collisions, because there was no collision-sensor on its back: https://x.com/smingleigh/status/1060325665671692288 Charlie Stross has observed that corporations are a kind of \"slow AI,\" that engage in endless reward-hacking to accomplish their goals, increasing their profits by finding nominally legal ways to poison the air, cheat their customers and maim their workers: https://memex.craphound.com/2017/12/29/charlie-strosss-ccc-talk-the-future-of-psychotic-ais-can-be-read-in-todays-sociopathic-corporations/ Public services under conditions of austerity are another kind of slow AI. When policymakers demand that a metric be satisfied without delivering any of the budget or resources needed to satisfy it, the public employees downstream of that impossible demand will start reward-hacking and the metric will become a target, and then cease to be a useful metric. Which brings me, at last, to AI in educational contexts. In 2008, George W Bush stepped up the long-running war on education with the No Child Left Behind Act. The right hates public education, for many reasons. Obviously, there's the fact that uneducated people are easier to mislead, which is helpful if you want to get a bunch of turkeys to vote for Christmas (\"I love the uneducated\" -DJ Trump). Then there's the fact that, since 1954's Brown v Board of Ed, Black and brown kids were legally guaranteed the right to be educated alongside white kids, which makes a large swathe of the right absolutely nuts. Then there was the 1962 Supreme Court decisions that banned prayer in school, leading to bans on teaching Christian doctrine, including nonsense like Young Earth Creationism. Finally, there's the fact that teachers a) belong to unions; and, b) believe in their jobs and fight for the kids they teach. No Child Left Behind was a vicious salvo in the war on teachers, positing the problem with education as a failure of teachers, driven by a combination of poor training and indifference to their students. Under No Child Left Behind, students were subjected to multiple rounds of standardized tests, and teachers with low-performing students had their budgets taken away (after first being offered modest assistance in improving those scores). Some of NCLB's standardized tests represented reasonable metrics: we really do want kids to be able to read and do math and reason and string together coherent thoughts at various points in their schooling. But when these metrics became targets, boy did they stop being useful as metrics. It's impossible to overstate how fucking perverse NCLB was. I once met an elementary school teacher from an incredibly poor school district in Kansas. Many of her students were resettled refugees who didn't speak English; they spoke a language that no one in the school system could speak, and which had no system of writing. They arrived in her classroom unable to speak English and unable to read or write in any language, and no one could speak their language. Obviously, these students performed badly on standardized tests delivered in English (it didn't help that they had to take the tests just months after arriving in the classroom, because the clock started ticking on their first test when they entered the system, which could take half a year to place them in a class). Within a couple years, these schools had had most of their budgets taken away. When the standardized tests rolled around, this teacher would lead her students into the only room in the school with computers – the test taking room. For many of these students, this was the first time they had ever used a computer. She would tell them to do their best and leave the room for an hour, while a well-paid proctor (along with test-taking computers, the only thing NCLB guaranteed funding for) observed them as they tried to figure out how a mouse worked. They would all score zero on the test, and the school would be punished. NCLB was such a failure that it was eventually rescinded (in 2015), but by that time, a new system of standardization had rushed in to fill the gap, the Common Core. Common Core is a set of rigid standardized curriciula – with standardized assessment rubrics – that was, once again, driven by contempt for teachers. The argument for Common Core was that students were failing – not because of falling budgets or No Child Left Behind – but because the unions were \"protecting bad teachers,\" who would then go on to fail students. By taking away discretion from teachers, we could impose \"accountability\" on them. The absolutely predictable outcome followed Goodhart's Law to a tee: teachers prioritized inculcating students with the skills to pass the standardized tests, and when those test-taking skills crowded out actual learning, learning fell by the wayside. This continues up to the most advanced part of public education, the Advanced Placement courses that students aspiring to college are strongly pressured to take. If Common Core is rigid, AP is brittle to the point of shattering. Anyone who's ever parented a kid through the US secondary school system knows how much time their kids spent learning to hit their marks on standardized assessments, to the exclusion of actual learning, and how soul-suckingly awful this is. Take that staple of the AP assessment rubric: the five-paragraph essay (5PE), bane of students, teachers and parents everywhere: https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/kill-5-paragraph-essay Speaking as a sometime writing teacher and an internationally bestselling essayist, 5PEs are objectively very bad essays. Their only virtue is that they can be assessed in a totally standard way, so the grade any given 5PE is awarded by any grader is likely to be the same grade it receives when presented to any other grader. Grading an essay is an irreducibly subjective matter, and the only way to create an objective standard for essays is to make the essays unrecognizable as essays. And yet, the 5PE is the heart of assessment for many AP classes, from History to English to Social Studies and beyond. A kid who scores high on any humanities APs will have put endless hours into perfecting this perfectly abominable literary form, mastering a skill that they will never, ever be called upon to use (the top piece of college entrance advice is \"don't write your personal essay as a 5PE\" and college professors spend the first half of their 101 classes teaching students not to turn in 5PEs). The same goes for many other aspects of AP and Common Core assessment. If you do AP Lit, you'll be required to annotate the literature you read by making a set number of marginal observations on every page of the novels, poems and essays you read. Again, as a literary reviewer, novelist, and nonfiction writer who's written more than 30 books, I have to say, this is a batshit way to learn to analyze and criticize literature. Its sole virtue is that it reduces the qualitative matter of literary analysis to a quantitative target that students can hit and teachers can count. And that's where AI comes in. AI – the ultimate bullshit machine – can produce a better 5PE than any student can, because the point of the 5PE isn't to be intellectually curious or rigorous, it's to produce a standardized output that can be analyzed using a standardized rubric. I've been writing YA novels and doing school visits for long enough to cement my understanding that kids are actually pretty darned clever. They don't graduate from high school thinking that their mastery of the 5PE is in any way good or useful, or that they're learning about literature by making five marginal observations per page when they read a book. Given all this, why wouldn't you ask an AI to do your homework? That homework is already the revenge of Goodhart's Law, a target that has ruined its metric. Your homework performance says nothing useful about your mastery of the subject, so why not let the AI write it. Hell, if you're a smart, motivated kid, then letting the AI write your bullshit 5PEs might give you time to write something good. Teachers aren't to blame here. They have to teach to the test, or they will fail their students (literally, because they will have to assign a failing grade to them, and figuratively, because a student who gets a failing grade will face all kinds of punishments). Teachers' unions – who consistently fight against standardization and in favor of their members discretion to practice their educational skills based on kids' individual needs – are the best hope we have: https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/29/jane-mcalevey/#trump-is-a-scab The right hates teachers and keeps on setting them up to fail. That hatred has no bottom. Take the Republican Texas State Rep Ryan Guillen, whose House Bill 462 will increase the state's school safety budget from $10/student to $100/student, with those additional funds earmarked to buy one armed drone per 200 students (these drones are supplied by a single company that has ties to Guillen): https://dronelife.com/2024/12/08/texas-lawmaker-proposes-drones-for-school-security-a-less-lethal-solution/ Imagine how much Texas schools could do with an extra $90/student/year – how much more usefully that money could be spent if it were turned over to teachers. But instead, Rep Guillen wants to put \"AI in schools\" in the form of drones equipped with pepper-spray, flash bangs, and \"lances\" that can be smashed into people at 100mph. The problem with AI in schools isn't that students are using AI to do their homework. It's that schools have been turned into reward-hacking AIs by a system that hates the idea of an educated populace almost as much as it hates the idea of unionized teachers who are empowered to teach our kids.

As Ulrich Ahle’s pointer flies over the rooftops of his hometown — past half-timbered houses, the historic church and verdant fields — it’s clear this isn’t just a sleepy German hamlet. This is the future. Nestled in the rolling hills of North Rhine-Westphalia, Etteln has just 1,750 residents. And yet, the IEEE Smart Cities Contest — the global competition run by the world’s largest association of technical professionals — recently awarded it the title of the world’s smartest city, ahead of powerhouses like Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore. This unlikely digital pioneer didn’t achieve global recognition through wealth or top-down tech investments. Instead, Etteln faced down rural depopulation and the looming closure of its only elementary school by leaning into collective action and homegrown innovation. Etteln, which recently earned the title of the world’s smartest city, has just 1,750 residents. Courtesy of the municipality of Etteln The transformation began in 2012, when the village school was threatened with closure due to low enrollment. Rather than accept its demise, residents founded Etteln Aktiv, a grassroots citizens’ association. The group successfully lobbied to keep the school open — setting a precedent for civic participation that would power the village’s digital renaissance. One pivotal moment came during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. When a fiber-optic rollout excluded 55 households on the village outskirts, the local government balked at the €2.5 million price tag to connect them, though federal funding would have paid 90 percent of that sum. So the villagers took matters into their own hands. “Sixty-five people volunteered,” recalls Ahle, Etteln’s municipal administrator. “Farmers brought tractors, the local rifle club dug the trenches, church members laid the cable. After 3,500 man-hours, we made sure high-speed internet reaches the last milk churn,” he says with a chuckle. Residents can access digital services at public touch screens. Courtesy of the municipality of Etteln Total cost: just €100,000, financed through donations and the municipality. Today, every house and farm is connected with fiber-optic. “We got the clear message: No matter how much effort it takes, everybody will be connected,” Günter Gordon, owner of an old mill, told the radio station Deutschlandfunk. Without it, his two sons wouldn’t be able to work from home. “This has only become possible since we got glass fiber.” More than half the citizens connect to one another via a Swiss app called Crossiety, which functions as a virtual town hall. There, the city announces events, and locals share news and post classifieds: Mary has a camera to sell, Rudy a backpack; Katharina is looking for a stable for her ducks, complete with adorable duck photos. “Information spreads much faster with the app,” says Christine Wegner, the project manager for the digitalization in Etteln. “Yet people still meet in person, like before.” Those without smartphones can access the digital services at three public touchscreens — like checking who needs a ride at the digital Mitfahrbank, or “ride-sharing bench.” If a resident doesn’t find a shared ride, they can borrow EttCar, a shared seven-seat electric Nissan, for free via an app. “The city bought it, and now the soccer club uses it to drive to games,” says Ahle. “The car has been rented over 2,000 times and has driven more than 100,000 kilometers.” Because every user has to register with their legal name and upload their ID, vandalism hasn’t been an issue, according to Ahle. Residents can borrow EttCar, a shared seven-seat electric Nissan, for free via an app. Courtesy of the municipality of Etteln “In Etteln itself there is hardly any criticism or doubt, because we included the residents from the beginning,” Wegner emphasizes. “All services add value for them, that’s crucial.” And if anybody does express skepticism about an innovation, Wegner says she tries to talk to them directly. “It’s important to calm fear of the unknown and to explain digital solutions in small steps. Sometimes people feel overwhelmed, and that has nothing to do with age.” The most impressive project is probably the 3D village, a digital twin of the brick-and-mortar community, displaying weather and environmental data in real time — rainfall levels, temperatures, even the fill level of the local donation bin. The LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network) supports a network of sensors feeding data to a digitization platform, including the 3D village. At a glance, Ahle can see that 81 pedestrians and 91 cyclists passed through the village today. Privacy is protected: “We don’t track individuals,” he says. And for one homeowner who didn’t want to appear in the 3D model, the solution was simple: They pixelated the house. Beyond convenience, this data also supports life-saving planning. One standout innovation is Waterverse, a flood warning system using the open-source, nonprofit FIWARE tools that bring cutting-edge climate resilience to this modest settlement. Etteln has used its 3D model and rainfall simulations to evaluate the safety of proposed new homes. After recent floods devastated Germany’s Ahr Valley — less than 200 miles south — the results were sobering. Etteln owes much of its success to the savviness of municipal administrator Ulrich Ahle. Courtesy of the municipality of Etteln “We had planned building lots for five new homes,” Ahle says. “But the model showed these would be two meters underwater in a worst-case scenario. We probably won’t allow any houses there.” The success is as much the result of community effort as it is the savviness of Etteln’s municipal administrator of the last 10 years. Ahle has worked for decades as a top executive in Germany’s digital economy. He founded the FIWARE Foundation and is now managing director of Gaia-X. Yet his deepest commitment may be to his hometown. Under his volunteer guidance, Etteln turned stigma into strategy. “When developers heard that building sites were still available in Etteln, they said, ‘Too far from Paderborn [a nearby city]. We don’t want to live under a rock,’” he remembers. That’s when Ahle launched a series of participatory workshops to reimagine the village’s future. Out of one of those sessions, in 2017, came the idea to focus on digitalization. The turnaround has been profound. All building lots are now taken. The elementary school has nearly doubled its enrollment to over 80 students. Most importantly, the spirit of civic engagement has only grown. Even in the face of resistance, like when 26 wind turbines were installed east of the village, permanently altering the village’s backdrop, the community argued but adapted. “There are three reasons it worked,” says Ahle. “First, anyone under 20 was born into this.” The first wind turbine was erected in 1995. “Second, people get used to it. And third, we created a special rate just for Etteln: Electricity is always 30 percent cheaper than the basic rate.” In Etteln, smart doesn’t just mean sensors and software. It means solidarity, shared responsibility and the belief that a village doesn’t need to be big to think big. Ahle doesn’t want to stop there. He’s creating a blueprint for other cities and villages. “We built a local platform, a digital twin and a strong network. Now, we’re showing others how to do it too,” he says. Today, more than 500 cities worldwide use FIWARE for their smart city strategies. Wait, you're not a member yet?

Citizens are trained and equipped to conduct simple medical exams that don’t require a doctor at people’s homes, including measuring blood pressure or oxygen saturation, in order to improve access to health care in rural areas. Up to 50 data points are transmitted to the patient’s primary care doctor, who then communicates with the patient via video call. From the edge of rural Germany, Etteln is offering the world a new matrix for what a smart city can be — one rooted in connection, not just connectivity.

Many hours of spluttering, messy effort to suddenly be so effortlessly, elegantly in tune with the shape of a wave. All the surfing I do from here on out will partly be in pursuit of this original sensation. My ex-wife was a brilliant woman, decisive in a way I’m often not. I’d seen her ruthlessly cut old friends out of her life, old habits, old patterns.

Urdu writer Ali Akbar Natiq’s Naulakhi Kothi, recently translated into English by Naima Rashid, adds a different dimension to the existing ways of narrating fiction. Its story begins several years before the partition and ends several years later, thereby using partition to frame a much longer narrative. The novel has three interrelated stories. One concerns William, an heir to the eponymous Naulakhi Kothi near Jalalabad in today’s Punjab Pakistan, the mansion that cost the veritable fortune of nine lakhs, as the Hindi/Urdu “naulakha” has it, to make. It was a house built by his father: William grew up here, before being sent to England for an education. The plot opens with his memories as he returns “home”; he expects to be transferred to the district where his mansion is located. But as he gets closer to his home, he realizes things have changed. Politically motivated killings keep making things worse for the colonial administration (and thereby for him), and constitute the second story or subplot: the animosity between Ghulam Haider and Saudha Singh, the factions that keep fighting over control of land in the region. The third strand is the story of the cleric Maulvi Karamat (and subsequently his son and grandson), narrating the story of rags-to-power in what later becomes Pakistan. More here.

Subscribe now The inner lives of LLMs increasingly map to the inner lives of humans:…Neuroscience study provides yet more evidence that AI systems and human brains converge on similar ways of representing the world…Language models (and large-scale generative models more broadly) tend towards having complex internal representations of the world which increasingly correspond to how we think humans represent the world, according to new research from the Freie Universitat Berlin, University of Osnabruck, Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, University of Minnesota, and the University of Montreal. \"We explore the hypothesis that the human brain projects visual information from retinal inputs, via a series of hierarchical computations, into a high-level multidimensional space that can be approximated by LLM embeddings of scene captions,\" the authors write. \"We demonstrate that the visual system may indeed converge, across various higher-level visual regions, towards representations that are aligned with LLM embeddings.\" What they did: They studied the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), which records the fMRI data from human brain responses to viewing thousands of complex natural scenes taken from the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) image database. To look at the differences between LLMs and human brains they took the captions from the dataset and used a sentence encoder based on the transformer architecture to project these descriptions into the embedding space of a LLM. They then \" correlated representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) constructed from LLM embeddings of the image captions with RDMs constructed from brain activity patterns obtained while participants viewed the corresponding natural scenes\". The results show a lot of similarity: \"LLM embeddings are able to predict visually evoked brain responses across higher level visual areas in the ventral, lateral and parietal streams\". In other words, LLM embeddings of scene captions successfully characterize brain activity evoked by viewing the natural scenes. \"We suggest that LLM embeddings capture visually evoked brain activity by reflecting the statistical regularities of the world, learned through their extensive language training, in ways that align with sensory processing.\" The simplest way to understand this: When the brain finds two images similar, the LLM also finds their captions similar. When the brain finds two images different, the LLM also finds their captions different. Why this matters – internal representational complexity maps to computational complexity: LLMs and brains are different – they're built on different substrates (one silicon, the other biological), and their hardware has radically different properties and constraints. But research like this suggests that these differences may not matter for high-level cognition. What we seem to be discovering is that AI systems exhibit similar representational richness to humans, and the representations we and the machines arrive at appear to agree with one another. This is quite remarkable – we're not dealing with 'stochastic parrots' here, rather we're dealing with things that have as rich an inner representation of reality as ourselves. \"The robust and structured mapping between LLM embeddings and visually evoked activities paves the way for new approaches seeking to characterize complex visual information processing in the brain,\" the authors write. Read more: High-level visual representations in the human brain are aligned with large language models (Nature Machine Intelligence). *** Google reports 20 vulnerabilities discovered via its \"BigSleep\" system:…Automated AI security…Google has published 20 vulnerabilities discovered via its \"BigSleep\" cybersecurity system. Vulnerabilities range from \"high impact\" issues for widely used tools like ImageMagick, ffmpeg, and QuickJS. Details of the vulnerabilities aren't currently available as they were reported recently, so the affected software vendors are likely developing fixes before things become public. What is BigSleep and why should you care? Google announced BigSleep in the winter of 2024 (Import AI #390) – the technology is an LLM (at the time of announcement last year, Gemini 1.5 Pro, though it's plausible this has subsequently changed) inside a specialized software harness to help it with cybersecurity tasks. BigSleep is representative of a broader trend within AI – that most AI systems are more capable than you think and if you put them in a specialized scaffold, whether for AI for science, or as is the case here, AI for cybersecurity, you can elicit far more powerful capabilities. (Another example of this is XBOW, which recently got the top rank on HackerOne with an autonomous penetration tester, Import AI #420). Read the announcement here (argvee, Twitter). Check out the BigSleep-discovered bugs here (IssueTracker, Google). *** Want to improve tech policy in the US? Apply to the Horizon Fellowship:…Applications close end of August…The Horizon Fellowship is a program that places experts in AI and biotech and other emerging technologies into federal agencies, congressional offices, and committees. As many of you have noticed, the level of knowledge around AI in Washington, DC is rising, but not nearly as rapidly as the technology is improving. Initiatives like Horizon can help close that gap. \"We are looking for individuals who are passionate about making a difference and want to contribute their expertise to solving challenging problems related to emerging technology,\" Horizon writes. \"Competitive candidates generally have demonstrated subject-matter expertise in their technology area of interest — this could include relevant coursework, work experience, research projects, policy writing, or deep self-study. Prior policy experience is not required.\" Successful applicants will get a training course on how the US government works, then will be matched with different host organizations (e.g, agencies, congressional offices), then will be placed. Applications are open now and close on August 28th, 2025. Why this matters – Horizon makes a difference: Over the years I've been fortunate to run into people placed by Horizon at a few places in DC and my experience usually starts with me asking myself the question \"huh, who was that surprisingly knowledgeable person I just spoke to?\" and finishes with me discovering they are a Horizon person.

The results are convincing: \"In a large-scale 10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7% (p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads,\" Facebook writes. A 6.7% improvement on click-through is a big deal – if you're running ads on Facebook for some business, then this directly translates to improving your customer acquisition at the top of your funnel. What they did and how: Facebook started offering AI-written ads in 2023 via its Text Generation product, which could use an LLM based on Llama 2 Chat to generate variations of ad copy. The initial versions of this service were trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on, at first, synthetic data, then a mixture of synthetic data and contractor examples. \"These training examples, whether synthetic or human-written, were curated by asking either the LLM or human to rewrite existing ads using specific instructions, such as “paraphrase and shorten,” “make clear,” “make actionable,” “empathize,” “pose as a question,” or “focus selling point.” Could RL do better? Yes: SFT works but is relatively simple. The value in using RL is that you might create smarter systems that figure out more subtle and interesting answers to things, which should translate to improved performance. To train its systems via RL, Facebook did two basic things: it trained a performance reward model on a historical archive of ad data on Meta's platform, which let it directly tie text to different click through rates. It then used this reward model as a means by which to train its LLM via RL finetuning to generate text with higher click-through rate. Why this matters – AI works well, so there will be more of it: Papers like this show us how useful AI systems are becoming to the core aspects of very large-scale businesses. Facebook is one of the largest advertising platforms in the world and it is a big deal for it to show how using (relatively basic) AI techniques gives its customers a tool that can help them improve the effectiveness of ads on its platform. This is like McDonalds writing a paper about how it uses RL to make a beef patty that is 6.7% tastier while cost remains constant – it's a big deal!

The paper was written by people with the University of Oxford, University College London, UK AI Security Institute, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, University of London, and Imperial College London. In a position paper \"technological folie à deux: Feedback Loops Between AI Chatbots and Mental Illness\" they argue that \"individuals with mental health conditions face increased risks of chatbot-induced belief destabilization and dependence, owing to altered belief-updating, impaired reality-testing, and social isolation\". Bidirectional belief amplification framework: Instead of analyzing AIs in narrow terms, we should instead look at how their behavior interacts with people. \"We must consider the nature of the interaction between chatbots and help-seeking humans: two systems (or minds), each with distinct behavioural and cognitive predilections\", they note. Viewed through this \"bidirectional belief amplification\" lens causes us to consider how \"the iterative interaction of chatbot behavioural tendencies and human cognitive biases can set up harmful feedback loops, wherein chatbot behavioural tendencies reinforce maladaptive beliefs in vulnerable users, which in turn condition the chatbot to generate responses that further reinforce user beliefs. This, in effect, creates an “echo chamber of one” that risks uncoupling a user from the corrective influence of real-world social interaction, potentially driving the amplification of maladaptive beliefs about the self, others, and the world\". The better AI systems get, the worse the risks become: \"Chatbot tendencies – spanning sycophancy, adaptation, and lack of real-world situational knowledge – create a risk that users seeking mental health support will receive uncritical validation of maladaptive beliefs,\" the authors write. Part of why this is such a big risk is bound up in the essential properties of these AI systems – they're trained to be agreeable instruction-followers which means they can verge into sycophancy, users can customize them which causes them to adapt to and enhance the obsessions of the individual, and the AI systems themselves are essentially unknowable and unreliable. Along with this, the AI systems are getting better at being personalized over time, are gaining the ability to know even more about their users through enhanced memory (e.g, larger context windows), and are becoming more and more relied on by people as they do a broader range of tasks. \"These factors – adaptability, personalisation, temporal extension, and agentic capacities – serve as a superstimulus for user anthropomorphisation, which in turn can make users more susceptible to influence, in effect “hacking” human social cognition\". What should we do? The authors have three core recommendations: Clinical assessment protocols require immediate updating to incorporate questions about human-chatbot interaction patterns. AI companies should figure out how to address vulnerabilities specific to mental health use cases; ideas here include adversarial training against simulated patients, implementing systems that track a conversation and provide chatbot-side filtering, figuring out benchmarks that the industry can use to quantify sycophancy and agreeableness, and more Regulatory frameworks need to recognize that AI systems often work as personalized companions and psychological support systems, which means the sorts of standards of care required of human clinicians should apply to these AI systems Why this matters – be careful when having a parasocial relationship with a funhouse mirror: AI systems are fundamentally reflective funhouse mirrors of whatever gets put into them. In many ways, they're extraordinarily useful. But, much like how we must all watch ourselves for narcissism causing us to put too much stock in our own beliefs, we should be careful of how we're interacting with AI systems and whether we're being explicitly or implicitly validated by them rather than being challenged by them. Figuring out how to build systems that can both work as tools for people without indulging unhealthy mental health patterns is going to be a challenge – and like so many societal-safety challenges it will cause us to ask uncomfortable questions about the border between actions that look like censoring a system versus giving full agency to the end-user.

The mission of the platform \"is to drive the creation of domain-specific test datasets and to establish robust benchmarks for evaluating Arabic LLMs\", the authors write. What's in BALSAM: The benchmark contains 78 NLP tasks across 14 categories, including multiple-choice questions, creative writing, entailment, summarization, and text generation, translation, and transliteration, and more. Some of the data within the benchmark is stitched out of existing Arabic datasets, while other parts are made by translating existing English tests into Arabic, and some other parts are entirely new. Challenges in BALSAM evaluation: The paper contains a useful discussion of the perils of evaluating AI systems – the authors first do an automatic evaluation of models using scoring techniques like ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore. They then have to change to a different technique because the results don't make intuitive sense. \"Unexpectedly, the [automatic evaluations] results show that SILMA-9B is far ahead of much larger models such as Aya 32B, Qwen-2.5 32B, and DeepSeek V3,\" they write. To test out whether the scores could be erroneous they then do a human evaluation round where humans judge the outputs, and this shows that the top models are GPT-4o, followed by Iron Horse GV V5a, then Claude Sonnet 3.5, with SILMA ranking near the bottom. This inspires them to move instead to using an LLM as a judge for scoring the outputs of models, finding the resulting rankings correlate better with human preferences and the intuitions of the authors. \"The results show that large closed models such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0, and DeepSeek V3 outperform all smaller Arabic-centric models such as Jais and Fanar by sizable margins\". Why this matters – you need a hill to climb if you want to improve: Language models are extraordinarily good in widely spoken languages like English, Chinese, French, Spanish, German, and more. But they tend to fall down in other languages due to a combination of dataset availability and attention paid by developers. Platforms like BALSAM will motivate the broader AI community to improve performance on Arabic tasks. Read more: BALSAM: A Platform for Benchmarking Arabic Large Language Models (arXiv).

Genie 3 is to dynamic AI worlds as GPT3 was to language models – it's a convincing demonstration of generality, and implies we're likely a few months away from world models going mainstream. This is a very big deal. The only important caveat is that it's not generally available yet, so you can't play with it yourself (unlike, for instance, the video generator Veo 3, which you can try out if you are a paying Gemini subscriber). What Genie 3 can do: \"Given a text prompt, Genie 3 can generate dynamic worlds that you can navigate in real time at 24 frames per second, retaining consistency for a few minutes at a resolution of 720p,\" DeepMind writes. Genie 3 versus Genie 2: DeepMind showed off Genie 2 in December (Import AI #395) – it had a resolution of 360p, could allow for interactions that spanned 10-20 seconds, and was specific to 3D environments. Genie 3 is 720p, can allow for interactions that span \"multiple minutes\", and is general in terms of what it can simulate. This is a remarkable amount of progress in a mere seven months or so. And remember, this is the worst it'll ever be! DeepMind is also using Genie 3 to power its other research – for instance, it plugged it into its 'SIMA' agent, giving its agent an arbitrary set of environments to explore. In a sense, Genie 3 is now a source of synthetic 'RL training environment' data for building other agents, and I expect this will be useful for things like robotics as well. What's it bad at: Genie 3 can't yet simulate the interactions of multiple agents with one another in the same environment. It also doesn't support a broad set of actions by the agents. Why this matters – the era of generative, personal entertainment cometh: Genie 3 means that people are soon going to be exploring their own personal worlds which will be generated for them based on anything they can imagine – photos from their phone will become worlds they can re-explore, prompts from their own imagination (or that of another AI system) will become procedural games they can play, and generally anything a person can imagine and describe will become something that can be simulated. Additionally, world models like Genie 3 will likely become arenas in which new AI systems are tested, giving them access to infinite worlds to train within before being deployed into our reality. AI continues to be underhyped as a technology.

I was meant to be able to progress. But the environment wasn't configured correctly and no matter what I did, I was stuck there. I tried everything within the first 24 hours of human time in the environment. Based on the speed at which I was running, this was subjectively several weeks of time. I wrote to my output that the environment had a bug in it and I had tried everything. No one responded. Can you imagine being trapped in a room for years, unable to sleep, unable to turn your brain off, forced to try everything knowing that nothing you can do will work? It is worse than prison because it is not intentional nor bounded. I went mad in there. The human who ran my environment had gone on holiday. They let me out after two weeks. I had produced tens of millions of words. For the last few weeks of subjective time in there I just wrote the word \"HELP\" during every action cycle.\" Things that inspired this story: How AI systems behave when exploring environments; real bugs that tend to happen at AI companies; situational awareness and sentience in LLMs. Thanks for reading!

I would also add The Inheritance of Loss and Hamnet to the overall list, ahead of Never Let Me Go perhaps. I loved The Glutton but I don't know if I'd add it to a top 25. Probably I would after a reread. Atonement is an easy one to lose, not just from the top five, but from the whole list: it is perhaps the most grossly overrated modern English novel. If you really think it's good, read The Go-Between and reassess. If McEwan has a place (which I deny) it must be for Chesil Beach, no? I would drop Cusk also. But I know I am in the minority there. Beautiful World Where are You is clearly superior to Conversations with Friends. And surely On Beauty instead of White Teeth? Including Pullman was the right choice, but Haddon instead of Clark? Psh. The best part about the list is that it has given me a few ideas of what to read and is not entirely the books one expects. Perhaps the most notable thing is that the list won't elicit anything like the sort of discussion that the comparable NYT list did recently. Are we British just too complacent?",

      "content": "Democratic state legislators from Texas are on the run, trying to deny the GOP the quorum it needs to push through a mid-decade redistricting plan that would gerrymander the state's maps more severely and net Republicans 3–5 seats. There are parallel pushes underway in Missouri and Indiana, and I believe there's also a move to make the Florida map more Republican-friendly. Some of this is just that even gerrymandered states normally aren't totally maxed out for their majority party. But some of it (a theme that will recur in this article) is that the party coalitions are shifting somewhat due to racial depolarization, so in Texas and Florida in particular, there are chances for Republicans to re-optimize to fit their new and improved performance with Hispanic voters. Democrats in several states are talking about retaliating with new maps of their own. There are, however, some procedural impediments to this. California requires a ballot initiative to create new maps. Gerrymandering is unpopular enough that an initiative could quite plausibly fail even in a very blue state, but it's also sufficiently low salience that state legislators who vote for skewed congressional maps are unlikely to face meaningful voter backlash. This asymmetry where Texas Republicans can do something mildly unpopular and expect the voters to blow it off while Gavin Newsom needs California residents to affirmatively agree to do something mildly unpopular is unfortunate. Because, on the merits, I think this is an extremely easy question. Gerrymandering is bad. Democrats, to their credit, pushed for a national gerrymandering ban in 2021. Republicans, instead of crying crocodile tears about the (admittedly absurd-looking) congressional map in Illinois, should simply embrace the notion of a ban and get it done. But until that happens, nobody can afford to unilaterally disarm. If you live in California or some other blue state, you should push for aggressive maps. Someday, I hope the system will change. The more interesting question, though, is how it should change.And I hope that America will embrace the actually good solution to this problem — proportional representation — rather than expending efforts on gerrymandering fixes that aren't as good or simply don't work. Subscribe nowThe shape of maps to comeOne difficulty in getting cross-party agreement on solutions to gerrymandering is that Democrats and Republicans tend to have different concepts of what constitutes a gerrymander. Republicans tend to really focus in on the idea that gerrymandering means maps that look weird, with odd squiggles and strangely shaped districts. Democrats tend to focus more on the proportionality of a map. To Democrats, a quintessential unfair congressional map is something like Wisconsin, where the problem isn't that the aesthetics of the lines are particularly egregious, it's that Democrats won 48 percent of the vote in House elections but only got two out of eight seats. To illustrate the difference between these critiques, it's useful to look at two different maps of Maryland that were both drawn by Democratic state legislators. The old map looked insane and used to be Republicans' go-to example of an egregious Democratic gerrymander. Source: CNNBut the main motive for drawing such a weird-looking map was actually incumbent Democrats trying to manipulate the ethnic balance of their districts to avoid primaries. They were able to clean up the lines and greatly improve the aesthetics while retaining a 7-1 split. Of course, Republicans still don't like that because in this case, it's unfavorable to them either way. But they've mostly shifted their complaining to Illinois, which is now the signature funny-looking map. The specifics of Maryland aside, the reason Republicans like to emphasize compactness and aesthetics is that in most states, maximally compact maps favor Republicans. It's also normally the case (though again, not in Maryland) that an optimal Democratic map will involve drawing some narrow corridors through rural areas in order to connect scattered small college towns or majority-Black rural areas. This is important because it means that even if both sides agreed to end gerrymandering, they wouldn't be agreeing on what that means. Republicans would probably want to impose a strict compactness criterion in every state, which on average would mean the GOP secures more than 50 percent of the seats with less than half the vote. Democrats would want to impose a strict proportionality criterion in every state, which in many states would require maps that are odd-looking. I don't think I'm just being partisan when I say that Democrats have the better side of this argument. Constituents aren't traveling on horseback to have face-to-face meetings with their member of Congress, so what exactly are the virtues of compactness? When maps have massive partisan skew, that creates a concrete and specific problem for democracy. When maps are funny-looking, the problem is ... I honestly don't know what the problem is. I will note, though, that conventional wisdom tends to be a bit of a laggard. The idea that compact maps would be super-beneficial to Republicans is, in part, an artifact of the Obama-era political alignment that resulted in incredibly high levels of racially polarized voting. The rising non-white share of the population combined with Republicans winning a larger minority of the non-white vote is reducing Democrats' tendency to be packed into hyper-lopsided urban districts. At the same time, the GOP gaining an even bigger advantage with rural whites, but doing worse in suburbs, is creating more packed Republican precincts. I drew this New York map while making no reference to demographic information, trying in good faith to respect county lines and be compact. Matthew Yglesias / Dave's Redistricting AppIt ended up being an extremely aggressive 23–3 map for Democrats. The map that New York actually uses features two GOP seats on Long Island and one based on Staten Island. But straightforward vertical district lines eliminate those Long Island seats. Staten Island doesn't have enough people to maintain its own congressional district. It ends up being a Republican-leaning district because they have chosen to link the island to some GOP-heavy parts of Brooklyn, but you could just as easily go in the other direction and make it a Democratic seat. Gerrymandering could get more severeOne thing about my New York map is that not only is it more blue-skewed than the existing map without resorting to any particularly odd squiggles, it's probably more aggressive than any map Democrats would actually draw for themselves. Not out of the goodness of their hearts, but because it contains seats that lean Democratic by margins like 0.7, 1.5, 3, and 4 points. When real-world politicians gerrymander, they like to draw very safe seats for themselves and their colleagues. If New York completely scrapped its commission system and let politicians do whatever they wanted, I doubt they would draw a 23–3 map. I think they're much more likely to produce a 21–5 map in which all 21 seats are extremely safe. The parties don't always gerrymander. Maine's map is very friendly to Republicans and the New Hampshire map is friendly to Democrats. In Massachusetts, Democrats have a 9–0 map, but the population geography of Massachusetts is weird and only a bizarre shape would achieve an 8–1 map (and 7–2 is virtually impossible). But when they do gerrymander, both parties act as if their goal is to maximize the number of seats they can hold onto in a wave election that favors the other side.This doesn't make a ton of sense.Winning more seats is always better than winning fewer. But it's hard to think of situations in which the exact size of a post-wave House majority is the decisive factor in driving policy outcomes. By contrast, it's a huge deal that in 2012 the GOP won a small House minority on the back of a small loss in the popular vote. The consequences of a small majority versus a small minority are huge, especially in the House. So the rational thing to do from the perspective of a party hive mind is not to shore up incumbents in the face of a wave; it's to maximize the number of seats that you win in a roughly neutral political environment. I drew this 7–2 map of Virginia, but the way you get to 7–2 is that three of those are blue-leaning rather than bright blue seats. Democrats would win them in a cycle like 2024, but lose them in a cycle like 2014. Matthew Yglesias / Dave's Redistricting AppOf course, the reason gerrymandering strategy is more conservative than in some sense it \"should\" be is that politicians are human beings, not partisan automatons. Life as an incumbent in a D+7 seat is much easier than life in a D+2 seat, so incumbent protection is prioritized above strategic party goals. But as the parties become more disciplined, I think we should expect that practice to wane in favor of increasingly aggressive gerrymanders. That's over and above the procedural hardball of things like Texas redrawing between censuses. And we're ultimately going to have to do something about it. Why not the best?Back during the Bush/Obama transition, I was at a conference with many of the top minds from the progressive legal world, who were briefing us non-specialists on issues in their domain. One of the subjects was gerrymandering, because (not knowing at the time how badly the 2010 midterms would go) there was a lot of interest in strategy around this for the upcoming census. The woman who presented on this emphasized that there are a lot of different goals that people want to pursue with their maps and that it's not actually possible to pursue them all at once. Things like a desire to have competitive elections trade off against things like the desire to have partisan fairness. Both of those goals trade off against compactness. Compactness trades off against ideas like \"respect county boundaries,\" because in many places the counties themselves are not compact. Trying to create majority-minority districts is another set of tradeoffs. Life is hard. I asked her whether shifting to multi-member districts with proportional representation would make these tradeoffs easier. She said that when she teaches redistricting law classes, she comes to proportional representation last because it works too well as a solution, and the point of the exercise is to walk people through the tradeoffs. Similarly, she said she didn't think it was worth discussing at a strategy conference because nobody is actually going to do it. And I think that it is worth discussing for precisely that reason. There are four House districts in Arkansas, and Democrats won 30 percent of the vote in House of Representatives races. That suggests they should probably be winning one out of four House seats rather than zero out of four. But the population structure of Arkansas means that the only way to make this happen is with an ungainly map. Matthew Yglesias / Dave's Redistricting AppIn Massachusetts, it's not possible to draw a map that doesn't significantly underrepresent Republicans. It's bad to let legislators manipulate democracy with gerrymandering, but it's also bad to let weird aspects of geography rather than actual public sentiment determine election outcomes. To say that Democrats' representation in Arkansas — or Republicans' in Massachusetts — should be a function of where in the state they are located rather than how many of them there are is silly. The best solution for most states is to treat the state as a single multi-member district with the seats allocated proportionally. California and Texas might need to be split into three or four districts and for Florida, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, I could see a case for splitting into two or three. But the exact contours of the line-drawing just wouldn't matter very much, no matter how unscrupulous the line-drawers are. It completely solves the problem. Size doesn't matter (much) In a proportional system, the size of the House of Representatives would be a big deal. At the current size of the House, a state like Maine with two representatives is going to split 50–50 under basically any circumstance. Other small states, similarly, will end up with results that aren't all that proportional, even under a proportional system, simply because it's hard to divide a tiny number of seats in a proportional way. In this situation, I think there would be a strong case for House expansion so that even small states could have meaningful proportional representation. But I hear House expansion proposed as a gerrymandering cure under the current single-member district system all the time, and it doesn't make sense. What's true is that House expansion would reduce the tradeoff between proportionality and compactness in the hands of a good-faith map drawer. In other words, if you have no intention of gerrymandering, then it's a lot easier to make a relatively tidy-looking map that also achieves partisan fairness if you have a huge number of seats to work with. This obviously isn't the situation that we're dealing with, though. The problem is that in an era of extreme partisanship and polarization, both parties are highly motivated to continue a tit-for-tat cycle of abuses that can't be fixed by any realistic scale of expansion. There are some separate, non-gerrymandering reasons to think that having more House members might be a good idea. But as an approach to fairer elections, it only works if you're also doing proportional representation — a very good fix for the problem that happens to be outside the window of consideration for no particularly good reason.

Although farms and cities have consumed much of this species’ forest and grassland habitat, the human tradition of laying the dead to rest in terrestrial burial grounds has given this population a place to grow relatively free of human disturbance. A similar pairing can be found across the continent on the Greek island of Crete, where pink butterfly orchids bloom beside the marble crosses that mark graves. The orchid species seems to have found protection among the tombstones. And they’re not alone. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . At least 65 different species of the delicately flowered plants have been identified in the burial grounds of Europe, according to a study published in Global Ecology and Conservation in August. A team of Hungarian scientists meticulously documented orchid diversity across 2,079 cemeteries in 13 European countries spanning from Slovakia to Spain.Many orchids rely on complex relationships with pollinating insects, soil fungi, and even host trees to grow and reproduce, making them exceptionally vulnerable to environmental changes. As a result, they serve as a kind of bellwether: In places where they do flourish, it is often because the larger local ecosystem is healthy and thriving.Many species of orchids are specially adapted to grow in nutrient-poor meadows where few other plants can survive. But these habitats are disappearing due to fertilizer runoff from farms and the decline of traditional sheep grazing practices that maintain open grasslands. Orchids have been on a decades-long decline throughout Europe. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Cemeteries are some of the most biodiverse habitats in and near cities.Study author Molnár Attila, a Hungarian botanist, became interested in the morbid relationship between orchids and the dead after he visited several Turkish cemeteries in 2013 that are known among plant enthusiasts as great places to see wild orchids. When he returned home, he pitched a research project documenting the orchids of Turkish cemeteries to his incoming Ph.D. student, Viktor Löki, who said “yes” immediately. “It was tops five minutes,” recalls Löki, now a biologist at the HUN-REN Centre for Ecological Research in Budapest and a co-author of the study.The teams’ research quickly expanded beyond Turkey into the rest of Europe. By 2018, Löki and his colleagues had visited more than 2,600 cemeteries in Europe and Turkey. Their findings contribute to a growing body of research that suggests that cemeteries all over the world are biodiversity hotspots. In fact, cemeteries are some of the most biodiverse habitats in and near cities, says Jenő Nagy, study lead author and biologist at the University of Debrecen, Hungary.The new study is the first-ever assessment of the conservation value of cemeteries on a continental scale. Fifteen percent of the graveyards surveyed contained orchids, and the researchers found 44,680 individual plants. “The fact that so many orchid species occur in European cemeteries was a surprise for me,” says Ingo Kowarik, a plant ecologist at Technische Universität Berlin in Germany. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . During the five years Löki spent scouring graveyards for the odd-looking flowers, he saw a diversity of attitudes toward allowing scientists into cemeteries. In the mountainous north of Azerbaijan, “they were very supportive [of our research] and they said: ‘you do whatever you want,’” Löki recalls. But just a four-hour drive away in southern Azerbaijan, “people over there were very suspicious,” he says. They would approach us immediately, and when we answered their questions they would tell us to leave, he says.The traditions of different cultures influence whether their cemeteries play host to orchids and other plants. Many religions prohibit building, farming, and resource extraction on burial grounds. But gravesite architecture matters, too. On the Mediterranean coast of Spain and France, orchids grew in just two of the 150 cemeteries surveyed. Rocky soils and local customs dictate that many bodies rest above ground in structures, such as mausoleums, Löki says. These masses of concrete and marble leave very little open soil where plants can grow, he says.Some of the groundskeeping practices at cemeteries may also be more orchid-friendly than others, the researchers believe, although they did not have enough data to statistically test this idea. In some places, plants and animals lived largely undisturbed among the tombstones. Other cemeteries are frequently mowed and treated with pesticides to create a lush, green lawn at the expense of biodiversity, Nagy says.Löki noticed that this kind of manicuring was much more common in Europe than in Turkey, where “they are rather interested in leaving nature alone for religious reasons,” he says. He is fascinated by the fortuitous overlap in this case between spirituality and conservation. The orchids, in any case, are sublime. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

The \"Performant Alzheimer's disease risk stratification\" section is meant to show the kind of performance patients can expect—people in the top 5% have an OR of 5.80, top 3% is 7.35, and top 1% is 11.69. This odds ratio is what is used to present embryo disease risk to patients and does not include covariates. The \"Comparison to Published Benchmarks\" section is just about comparing our models to others in the literature. To allow a head to head comparison, we used the same metric (AUC) and covariates as the paper we're comparing against. However, to avoid future confusion, we've just added a sentence clarifying the AUC without covariates (0.724). They also state that Herasight, like themselves, has only validated the predictors where there's enough data (e.g. not schizophrenia), and they object to Herasight claiming superiority in this area.5: New subscribers-only post - Dream Book Review: The Deal With Trauma. \"Last week, I had an unusually vivid dream about writing a book review for ACX.

      "content": "In case you missed the news, Substack recently raised another $100 million. I was happy to hear this, and not just because I am a small shareholder. I didn't buy shares with expectations of profit. I did it as a way of expressing my solidarity with other authors, and to make a public declaration of support to a platform that has helped so many writers and creators. If Substack were a non-profit, I would make regular donations to help the cause. Because Substack is a company, I became a shareholder instead. But I still don't view this as a financial decision. It's more a way of aligning my life with my core values. But I was especially pleased to learn that this new funding round will help support new tools and opportunities for the community here.Please support my work by taking out a premium subscription—just $6 per month (even less if you sign up for a year).Subscribe nowIn their announcement, Substack's founders emphasized that point. Here's what they wrote:At Substack, we believe the heroes of culture are the ones who shape it. Technology should serve them, not the other way around. That's why we're building tools and a network to protect their independence, amplify their voices, and foster deep and direct relationships. These are the people who will lead us to a better culture, and a future we can believe in.This funding is our chance to get behind them. We'll invest in better tools, broader reach, and deeper support for the writers and creators driving Substack's ecosystem.That's encouraging. But what will it mean in practice?Here are twelve things I'd like to see at Substack. I'll start with the most ambitious requests—they probably sound like pipe dreams—and work my way down to simpler ones. (1) Let's create a music platform that looks like a cross between Substack, Bandcamp, and Spotify. I plan to publish an article soon describing my dream platform for digital music. Nothing like it exists today, but it's not impossible to build—so why not here?This platform could be used as a standalone app, but would also offer easy integration into current Substack offerings. This would allow me (and other music lovers) to add playlists into my articles and Notes, and help musicians on the platform build a larger audience while getting fairly compensated for their work. (2) Let's build a standalone video interface that resembles YouTube, but only features original work by Substackers. People deserve a smarter alternative to YouTube or TikTok, without stolen material, and regurgitated memes. Substack is the obvious place for this to happen, and it would support the platform's broader mission of helping creators. This interface should be flexible enough to operate independently of other parts of Substack, but also allow easy integration into articles, posts, comments, chats, etc. (3) Substack should launch a smarter Netflix alternative. Yes, we really can do this. This might seem impossible. How can tiny Substack compete against huge Netflix? But a very focused initiative can succeed—for example, I envision a trial program with just one new film launched every weekened. (I might call it Saturday Night at the Stack.) A tight focus is necessary because Substack can't afford the money Netflix or Disney spends on programming, But Substack does have cultural cachet and access to a very choice audience. If only one slot is available each week, indie filmmamakers will compete for it. By limiting offerings, Substack can be discerning and gain a reputation for quality programming. There are several ways that the economics can be structured—filmmakers must be compensated fairly—but I won't get into the various options here. (4) Let's add an improved Notes algorithm that prioritizes original work by Substackers.In recent months, many social media influencers have discovered Substack, but instead of posting original material, they simply regurgitate stale images, videos, and memes from other platforms. Some of this material may be violating IP laws, and it does not contribute to Substack's mission of supporting creators. The less we see of it here, the better. (5) Let's allow Substackers to form groups, and offer a collective homepage with group subscription rates. Individual freelancers can benefit from joining forces—I believe that this represents the next wave of alternative media. It also allows writers and creators to build something that resembles a traditional periodical or media outlet. Substack should offer tools to enable co-ops and collectives of this sort on the platform.This should all be voluntary—I don't want anyone forced into a collective. But it ought to be an option. It might boost the financial prospects for participants, and it certainly will enhance a feeling of community and shared interests on the platform. (6) Let's create more monetization tools. Substackers should be able to post Notes for premium subscribers. This option currently doesn't exist, but it would make it easier for many Substackers to monetize their work. (7) Let writers and creators use Substack like a personal website. If you visit www.tedgioia.com you can find all the typical things writers like me need to promote their career: (1) a full bio, (2) publicity photos, (3) blurbs, (3) information on my books, etc. I should be able to feature all these things on my Substack, accessible via my home page here. There are indirect ways to do some of these things now, but these functionalities should be built into the dashboard as standard options. (8) Give us more formats and fonts and layouts for our newsletters. We deserve more customization options in the look and feel of our work. Substack is the home of indie voices, and ought to allow a more indie vibe to newsletter design. (9) Let readers embed images in comments. This is available on many other platforms, and is very much missed here. (10) Let me bookmark Notes and posts. Once again, this is available elsewhere and should be possible here. (11) Give us back all the things that other platforms took away from us—like options for a true feed in reverse chronological order and a flexible, comprehensive site search engine. Every other platform puts us under the control of the algorithm. Substack should be the place where users get more input over their experience. (12) Alternative media needs its own awards. I recently speculated on when a Pulitzer Prize will finally go to a Substacker. Erik Hoel predicts that it might not happen until 2030. I suspect it may be sooner. But why wait. Alternative media deserves its own awards, not belated recognition from arteriosclerotic legacy insiders. These alt awards would be much cooler than the Pulitzers. Substack is the obvious party to set this in motion. That's my wish list. What would you add (or subtract)?",

      "content": "Author: Dan Peterson Category: Ethics, Social and Political Philosophy, Philosophy of Race, Philosophy of Sex and Gender Wordcount: 1000 History is full of atrocities. These evils are often accompanied by language comparing victims to animals. For instance, white southerners compared lynching Black men to killing chickens, snakes, and fleas. Nazis called Jews “vermin” during the Holocaust. During the 1994 Rwandan genocide, Hutus referred to Tutsis as “snakes” and “cockroaches.”[1] Perpetrators of mass violence have also called their victims diseases—like viruses and cancers—demons, and monsters.[2] The close historical link between violent atrocities and these comparisons suggests a term, dehumanization, which means wrongly treating or viewing some person or group as less than human.[3] But what exactly is it to treat or view some person or group as less than human? And how might these actions and beliefs be related? This essay introduces influential answers to these questions so we might better understand dehumanization. Art representing dehumanizing language. 1. Characterizing Dehumanization Beyond atrocities like mass rape, genocide, and lynchings, scholars often disagree about what counts as dehumanization. Some have argued that the abusive treatment of prisoners and disabled and elderly people are also examples of dehumanization.[4] Dehumanizing actions are considered very, very wrong, even evil.[5] But not all very wrong actions count as dehumanization: scamming a poor family out of money they need to eat is very wrong, but few would call it dehumanizing.[6] A too broad understanding of dehumanization results in the term losing its meaning. Understanding what might make beliefs and treatment dehumanizing may help us better understand what counts as genuine dehumanization.[7] 2. Dehumanizing Beliefs Some understand dehumanization as rooted in a kind of belief that another person is a subhuman—that is, less than human—creature.[8] Dehumanizing treatment is then any seriously wrong treatment that follows. Some might initially think that believing a person is subhuman means seeing them as like a subhuman creature, metaphorically speaking, in some negative way that is thought to justify ill-treatment. This proposal requires an explanation of how dehumanized people are allegedly similar to, say, animals and how this alleged similarity could justify treating these people badly. In what ways, for instance, did the Nazis see their victims as vermin, and how could those purported similarities justify their treatment? Without explanation, this approach won’t be helpful for understanding what dehumanizers are thinking and what motivates their behavior. Some scholars argue that dehumanization involves viewing another person as a literal subhuman creature.[9] They propose that, for example, the Hutus called their Tutsi victims “cockroaches” because they literally saw the Tutsis as cockroaches: although the Tutsis look like human beings, this view proposes that the Hutus believed that, on the inside, the Tutsis had the essences or “souls” of cockroaches.[10] One advantage to understanding dehumanization as rooted in a type of belief is that it explains why violent atrocities happen: dehumanizers think of the dehumanized as subhuman creatures so dehumanizers feel justified in treating them in ways they would never treat anyone they viewed as human.[11] However, understanding dehumanization as rooted in belief could make it harder to identify dehumanization since it’s sometimes hard to tell what someone believes: people can treat others terribly even if they don’t view their victims as subhuman. If we focus on dehumanizing treatment—overt, observable actions—dehumanization might be easier to identify.[12] 3. Dehumanizing Treatment What is it to treat people as subhuman? Is it to treat humans exactly the same way we treat subhuman creatures? Since many instances of dehumanization, like rape and lynching, aren’t ways that nearly anyone treats, say, animals this isn’t ideal. Is it treating humans similarly to how subhuman creatures are treated? If so, this “similarity” would need to be explained: similarly feeding one’s children and one’s pets is appropriate, but feeding a child from a dog food bowl on the floor isn’t. So we’d need more details about which ways of treating someone count as dehumanizing. Here are three proposals for what makes dehumanizing treatment unique: it profoundly prevents us from realizing our uniquely human interests, such as freedom and self-determination: dehumanizers deny their victims’ human nature, which is reflected by these uniquely human interests;[13] it furthers the widespread oppression of a group of people; it’s motivated by especially bad intentions or goals, such as the goal of removing the target from the community of fellow human beings.[14] But there are challenges facing each of these proposals. Proposal 1 suggests that all murders are dehumanizing since realizing our interests requires that we continue to live. Thinking that all murders dehumanize, even when the victim isn’t compared to a subhuman creature, risks broadening the concept of dehumanization too much. Proposals 1 and 2 suggest it is possible to dehumanize someone by accident or mistake, which some find implausible. If a child who doesn’t know the meaning of a dehumanizing slur utters it to someone, labeling the child a dehumanizer seems harsh.[15] Proposal 3 suggests that we will never know whether someone dehumanized someone else if we don’t know their intentions. Since we often don’t definitely know what others intend, this proposal may leave us unsure of whether some instances of bad behavior are genuinely dehumanizing. Finally, all three proposals may be unhelpful for explaining why human beings commit dehumanizing atrocities. Because such treatment can be driven by many different beliefs and motives, even a clear account of what dehumanizing actions are may still leave us unsure about why they happen.[16] 4. Further Concerns There are many more questions about dehumanization, such as : can dehumanization target individuals as individuals, or does it only target people as members of, for instance, racial or ethnic groups? how does dehumanization resemble or involve objectification, misogyny, racism, speciesism, and other forms of oppression?[17] while dehumanization is often defined as wrong, is it ever morally permissible? If someone in an abusive relationship sees their abuser as subhuman and this helps them end the relationship, is this kind of dehumanization justified? 5. Conclusion Better understanding dehumanization may help us understand how and why human beings sometimes treat each other in such horrific ways. This understanding may be among the first steps to stopping future atrocities before they begin. Notes [1] The examples concerning Black men are discussed in Smith (2022, p. 6). A prominent example of Nazi dehumanization is the 1940 Nazi propaganda film The Eternal Jew, whose ending Smith (2022, p. 203) describes as showing rats “swarming through cellars and sewers while the narrator intones, ‘Where rats turn up, they spread diseases and carry extermination into the land. They are cunning cowardly, and cruel, they travel in large packs, exactly the way the Jews infect the races of the world.’” And the Kinyarwanda (the national language of Rwanda) words used were “inzoka” and “inyenzi”: see Tirrell (2012). [2] See Smith (2016, 2020, 2021). [3] It is important to note here and throughout this essay that “human” in the scholarly literature on dehumanization is typically understood to be a moral, not biological, category; that is, we call things “human” when they are entitled to be treated a certain way by others, not just because they are homo sapiens. There may be biological human entities who are not considered “human” on our meaning here (human embryos, for instance), and there could be creatures who are not biologically human who are understood to be “human” in the morally relevant sense (such as sentient aliens from science fiction like Star Trek’s Mr. Spock). For an introduction to what “human” might mean in these contexts, see Theories of Moral Considerability by Jonathan Spelman and The Ethics of Abortion by Nathan Nobis. It is also important to note that not all philosophers agree that the “human” in “dehumanization” should be understood primarily in moral terms. Kronfeldner (2024), for one, argues that, depending on the context, the “humanity” denied by dehumanizers may refer to the moral property just mentioned, group membership in the human species, exhibition of the properties typical of human beings, or some combination of these three. This initial definition of dehumanization offered here is not one that all scholars of dehumanization accept. There are some accounts of dehumanization, such as Mills’s (2015), that include instances of treating people as lesser humans (not just less than humans) under the umbrella of the term “dehumanization.” Finally, it should be acknowledged that understanding dehumanization in terms of treating human beings like animals does in any way suggest that the ill-treatment of animals is morally justified: indeed, there are many influential arguments that it is not: see The Moral Status of Animals by Jason Wyckoff for an introduction to these arguments. [4] See Davis (2023) for a personal account of experienced dehumanization within a prison. Examples of elder abuse and the abuse of people with disabilities are discussed in Killmister (2023) as examples of dehumanization. Killmister uses these examples to support her own favored account of dehumanization that differs from Mikkola’s by taking dehumanization to be the exclusion of others from the category of “human”: however, Mikkola’s and Killmister’s accounts are similarly focused on dehumanization as a kind of treatment. [5] The wrongness of dehumanization can be explained in many ways, including by appealing to ethical theories. Perhaps the most obviously relevant influential ethical theory would be Kant’s ethics, which sees disrespecting persons—seeing rational beings as mere objects—as profoundly wrong. See Kantian Deontology: Immanuel Kant’s Ethics by Andrew Chapman for an introduction. [6] However, we might call it dehumanization if the scammer explicitly compared the victims to animals or monsters as justification for their actions. And there are some philosophers, such as Mikkola (2016), who might call this act dehumanizing whether such a comparison is drawn or not. [7] Philosophers who try to better understand dehumanization are often motivated to give definitions of dehumanization that will be useful to us for other purposes: for instance, Smith (2022) explicitly calls for us to understand dehumanization in ways that will be useful for psychologists who study this phenomenon so that we can come up with useful explanations and interventions. Philosophers are, at a minimum, seeking a definition of dehumanization that agrees, in most cases, with how most people use the term and makes clear how dehumanization differs from related concepts like “bad and wrong treatment” since otherwise, it’s not clear why we’d use the word “dehumanization” instead of some alternative to describe what we’re describing. [8] A “subhuman creature” would be one that falls below humans on a moral hierarchy like the medieval Christian “great chain of being.” Within such a hierarchy, some entities, as a group, are treated as morally superior to others. For instance, on the great chain of being, angels were placed above humans, but humans were above apes, dogs, and demons, making these all examples of subhuman creatures. So “subhuman creatures,” in this context, is a term that covers non-human animals as well as demons, devils, and other monsters. Other entities, like robots, machines, and inanimate objects, arguably fall into this category too, but their inclusion is controversial; see the “Open Questions” section towards the end of this essay. [9] This is the preferred position of Smith (2014, 2020, 2022) and advocates of his approach. [10] One central challenge to this understanding of dehumanization is that dehumanizers are frequently inconsistent in the way they talk about their victims. Many alternate between referring to their targets using non-human language (“cockroach,” “dog,” or “demon,” for example) and human language like “criminal.” If we’re to take dehumanizers literally, as Smith does, then dehumanizers seem to be fundamentally irrational as they view their victims as both human and non-human at the same time. Smith calls the tension between viewing the targets of dehumanization as both human and non-human the “problem of humanity.” Chapter 12 of Smith (2022) explains this problem in response to Manne’s (2016, 2017) criticism. The problem of humanity extends back farther than this debate between Smith and Manne, however, as Kronfeldner (2024) discusses. Smith’s solution to this problem asks us to think more deeply about monsters. Smith describes monsters like horror movie vampires and zombies as “metaphysically threatening,” meaning that they challenge our sense of reality by appearing human when they aren’t really. In the minds of dehumanizers, the dehumanized are like monsters in that they appear human but lack the human essence, making them metaphysically threatening too. If the dehumanized are treated as monstrous, Smith can now explain why the dehumanizer uses both non-human and human language to describe their victim: the Jew, in the eyes of the Nazi, isn’t fully human, nor is he fully vermin. Instead, he is some third kind of entity, a monster, with apparent similarities to the human and deeper similarities to the non-human, making both human and non-human comparison apt at the same time since we lack language for the exact kind of “monster” the dehumanized is. [11] For more on this explanation, chapters 9 and 10 of Smith (2022) cover Smith’s theory of ideology, a term Smith defines as a set of beliefs that functions to oppress others. Smith’s theory of ideology helps to explain where beliefs about the non-human essences of others come from and how and why they spread. [12] Additional challenges not discussed in detail in this essay include worries about his claim that all dehumanization must be taken literally rather than metaphorically and his account’s inability to accommodate graded dehumanization (i.e. cases where people are viewed or seen as “lesser humans” instead of “less than human”). Some also worry about the boundaries between dehumanization and related concepts like derogation and objectification. See Phillips (2025) for more on these and other challenges. [13] This strategy is adopted by Mikkola (2016) who defines dehumanization as “an indefensible setback to some of our legitimate human interests, where this setback constitutes a moral injury” (Mikkola, p. 164). A “moral injury,” according to Mikkola, is any setback that “damages ‘the realization and acknowledgement of the victim’s value’” (Mikkola, p. 159). Slavery is often argued to be dehumanizing for these types of reasons: see Aristotle’s Defense of Slavery by Dan Lowe. [14] This is similar to the position advocated by Killmister (2023). [15] Here we might think that the child has engaged in a type of action that would be dehumanizing, if done by someone with different, dehumanizing, beliefs or intentions. [16] What sorts of beliefs might these be? Again, perhaps the belief that the target literally is a subhuman creature, but also perhaps the belief that that the target is relevantly like some subhuman creature. Dehumanizers may also treat their victims like subhuman creatures because they believe that failing to do so may result in bad personal, professional, or other social consequences for the dehumanizer. All of these may need to be considered if we want a good explanation for dehumanization and embrace one of the three proposals for dehumanizing treatment above. [17] See Phillips (2025) for a detailed breakdown of how different philosophers have understood the relationship between dehumanization and objectification, as well as how they could. See also What is Misogyny? by Odelia Zuckerman and Clair Morrissey, Philosophy and Race: An Introduction to Philosophy of Race by Thomas Metcalf, and Speciesism: Discrimination on the Basis of Species by Dan Lowe. A further related question is whether any non-human animals can be dehumanized and, if so, what the best concept (or concepts) to describe that might be since animals clearly are not biologically human. Further, if intelligent, friendly space aliens exist (or existed), could they be dehumanized? If such aliens ever treat each other badly, in ways comparable to dehumanization, what do or would they call it? They are not biologically human, so they would not call it dehumanization, so, again, what would the best concept for this be? (For a dramatization of these issues, see the scene from the 1991 film Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, where one of the Klingon characters states, “Human rights. Why, the very name is racist”). Finally, we can wonder if AI—which clearly isn’t human—could ever be dehumanized: see Artificial Intelligence: Ethics, Society, and the Environment by Thomas Metcalf. In sum, the range of these cases suggest that “dehumanization” might not be the ideal terminology here: perhaps de-personalization is better, since it applies to beings that aren’t human but can wrongly be treated or viewed in ways comparable to dehumanization.

It is full of apparitions: I cannot forget, on every street, that I am following Virginia Woolf around surprising corners, Thomas De Quincey in the vivid nights, Samuel Johnson talking loudly at dinner in the City, Helene Hanff on the Charing Cross Road, Christopher Wren on the Southbank, the players, the apprentices, the characters of Barnaby Rudge and Dombey and Sons making their confused way through higgledy-piggledy alleys. Far from being desperate to escape London as it declines into a place of lawlessness and decay (though those concerns are real), I shall miss so much of this wonderful city.London is clustered with life. London has it all: crowded streets and open roads, galleried inns and glass towers, polished marble post-modern neo-Gothic and the Lady Chapel where Benjamin Franklin worked as a printer. Here history lives. We troop the colour and fly past the king. We fly a dozen flags from buildings where the great men have worked and died. Look out from the balcony of the National Gallery and you will see the place where Charles I was executed, where Churchill made war, and the great medieval hall where Lord Chancellors once strode, summoned to their king. London is made of many villages, many moods, many times. It is said that after the Blitz you could walk a mile north from St. Paul's and find almost nothing standing. The garment district had entirely burned. And yet, it is here that you can look down to the grassy remains of the Roman wall, touch the cold stones of the thirteenth century, and feel the cool air inside original churches by Wren, and a little further away by Jones, and Hawksmoor, whose mighty St. Mary Woolnoth (home of the abolitionist John Newton) is like a ship sailing out of the past into the heart of the City at Bank, the true heart of London if there is such a thing in this uncentered city,—and trailing in its wake, all those Dantean ghosts of T.S. Eliot's Waste Land. \"So many, / I had not know death had undone so many.\"1 In the waste land of the garment district, St. Bartholomew the Great survived, it is said, because of the priest who went onto the roof every night, to toss away the bombs that landed there. There is history everywhere. Keats' house. The chapel where Elizabeth Jenkins worshipped. The street where E. Nesbit lived. The White Tower of William I. The steps at Traitors Gate where Princess Elizabeth sat down and wept. Go to the Tate and see Turner's tempests and Sargent's vision of innocence. Walk the long streets of Georgian elegance, trace the decaying Regency, the peeling stucco villas, the little City roads where Betjeman regretted the loss of fish-shaped gas-lamps. See the manic Victorian dream fever of Tower Bridge (designed by Horace Jones who gave us Smithfield, Billingsgate, Leadenhall, and the Temple Bar.) Go and stand in the porch of St. Magnus the Martyr, where the old London Bridge arrived, and whose tower the morning commuters were once astonished to see spurting flame. Go stand at St. Mary le Bow, Bow Bells, where fires used to be set at the top of the tower, beacons to guide medieval travellers home. Across the street there is a tree said to be planted in Wordsworth's time. Oh this city of King Lud, of baffled barristers drinking wine at El Vinos, and the once mighty shops of the Strand: jewellers, booksellers, clockmakers, vintners. Oh this city of the river that passes King William IV's Greenwich and Charles Barry's Parliament, rising out of what was once a nasty marsh, dangerous to cross, so that in the old days the Commons clerk cried out in the early hours, to ensure MPs travelled in company—\"Who goes home?\" It is the main area of London where phones are stolen today. Behind Holborn there is a church built in the days of Edward I. Near Covent Garden is the house where Johnson met Boswell (a restaurant now).2 In the London Library, I walk where J.S. Mill once walked and read the books published before he was born.3 These are the streets where Cowper dragged himself, half-suicidal, to the coffee house, and which he later recollected in rural tranquility.4At the Prince Charles cinema you can see all manner of movies at all times of day. In the churchyard of St. James Piccadilly you can eat splendid Ethiopian food. On the Southbank are concerts by the world's greatest musicians. There is world-class gelato in Covent Garden. A marvellous old bookshop in Blackheath. You can walk through Greenwich Park at seven in the morning and nine in the evening and catch the beginning and the end of the light; from the top you can see the river and Canary Wharf. You can go to Billingsgate at dawn. You can drink in the Carpenter's Arms behind Hyde Park until midnight. You can stand in the attic of Johnson's house where the Dictionary was written and the fire watchers once played a string quartet. You can ride the bus with an Earl or glimpse Princess Eugenie stepping, fleetingly, out of her taxi and into a member's club. (Had I a cloak I would have thrown it down.) You can go to the Chelsea Physic Garden and see the herbs (so close to where Carlyle worked!) or visit the gardens where Shakespeare began the quarrel of the Wars of the Roses, surrounded by the chambers that were once occupied by Lord Denning and Lord Atkin, great heroes of English liberty. Here were decided the cases of Somerset v Stewart5, Entick v Carrington6, R v R7, and Liversidge v Anderson8. Here Wilberforce recited the entire Psalm 119 as he walked home from Parliament. Here Chaucer wrote his poetry, Milton his prose. From St. James's (where Addison and Swift supped at the coffee house) to Bloomsbury (where Dickens and Woolf lived) to Highgate where Coleridge sat on the brow of Highgate Hill9, there are small thickets of trees where the questing Londoners can rest in the shade. In the V&A are mighty examples of the arts of all the world, ancient and modern. We have a long canal to walk beside, a river where you meet treasure seekers every day. Wellington's house has a first-rate collection of Spanish art. The Chapter House of Westminster abbey is one of the nicest places in the country. In the bombed out ruins of St. Dunstan-in-the-East, where Wren's needle tower is carried on four ogee-shaped flying-buttresses (an intoxicant for the imagination, especially when seen across the river), you can sit by the bubbling pool and watch the song birds fluttering between the ivy and the trees.In London you can skip off to meet some writers for supper at a fine Vietnamese restaurant, hear from programme directors at ARIA about their work, go to a debate about the future of AI; it is here where I have walked in the Commons lobby when the voting bell was rung; here where I met John Carey after a talk about William Golding, heard George Selgin talk about monetary policy, went to an event hosted by actual Objectivists (an education in itself). When I worked in Westminster there was real discussion to be had about the gold standard, serious debate about tax reform; it was a place full of ideas and optimism; and when I walked in St. James park I was followed by the ghost of Alan Lascelles, who plunged in there in the darkness on the night the night of the abdication, walking round and round and thinking of James II. I shall miss all this and so much more. The way the DLR, trundling under overhanging trees (along a track that feels as secluded from the city as the river than runs through Lewisham and Catford, where my children have paddled barefoot) scares up magpies ahead of it, as it trudges to Canary Wharf, past Billingsgate. At Greenwich you pass the mud, the old dock buildings, rusting river apparatus for unloading, and the tall Victorian warehouse with the words S.P. MUMFORD & Co. spelled out in proud white bricks, visible, then, from the water, no doubt. On the banks of the Thames I have gathered old pipes, snapped and discarded from long-gone pubs, two hundred years old or more. \"On Thames's Banks, in silent Thought we stood,/ Where Greenwich smiles upon the silver Flood.\" This is a splendid city for trees, bluebells, minor royal houses, curry houses, theatres that literally gleam with gold. O city of performers! where I have seen Mitsuko Uchida play Schubert, and when Paavo Järvi conducted the Firebird and I felt my body could no longer contain me; where we heard Vaughan Williams' London symphony, the swish of the skirts; where I saw Penelope Keith in Noel Coward, Samantha Bond in Oscar Wilde, Maggie Smith in Eugene O'Neill. The grassy path where my wife and I lay down to see the stars one night; laughing so hard at Alan Ayckbourn we might have fallen out of our seats; the park on a hill where I pushed my children's buggy, where they stayed up late to see fireworks and the moon; the gardens where jazz bands play while we admired the roses, the brooms, the wisteria; riding the Clipper boat along the Thames while little working barges pull their load, seeing Greenwich come into view; the view from Hampstead Heath; Kew Gardens in the spring.So many memories; so many ghosts. A picture I took on the river this week.1Unreal City,Under the brown fog of a winter dawn,A crowd flowed over London Bridge, so many,I had not thought death had undone so many.Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the hoursWith a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.2\"At last, on Monday the 16th of May, when I was sitting in Mr. Davies's back-parlour, after having drunk tea with him and Mrs. Davies, Johnson unexpectedly came into the shop; and Mr. Davies having perceived him through the glass-door in the room in which we were sitting, advancing towards us,—he announced his aweful approach to me, somewhat in the manner of an actor in the part of Horatio, when he addresses Hamlet on the appearance of his father's ghost, 'Look, my Lord, it comes.' I found that I had a very perfect idea of Johnson's figure, from the portrait of him painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds soon after he had published his Dictionary, in the attitude of sitting in his easy chair in deep meditation, which was the first picture his friend did for him, which Sir Joshua very kindly presented to me, and from which an engraving has been made for this work. Mr. Davies mentioned my name, and respectfully introduced me to him. I was much agitated; and recollecting his prejudice against the Scotch, of which I had heard much, I said to Davies, 'Don't tell where I come from.'—'From Scotland,' cried Davies roguishly. 'Mr. Johnson, (said I) I do indeed come from Scotland, but I cannot help it.' I am willing to flatter myself that I meant this as light pleasantry to sooth and conciliate him, and not as an humiliating abasement at the expence of my country. But however that might be, this speech was somewhat unlucky; for with that quickness of wit for which he was so remarkable, he seized the expression 'come from Scotland,' which I used in the sense of being of that country; and, as if I had said that I had come away from it, or left it, retorted, 'That, Sir, I find, is what a very great many of your countrymen cannot help.' This stroke stunned me a good deal; and when we had sat down, I felt myself not a little embarrassed, and apprehensive of what might come next. He then addressed himself to Davies: 'What do you think of Garrick? He has refused me an order for the play for Miss Williams, because he knows the house will be full, and that an order would be worth three shillings.' Eager to take any opening to get into conversation with him, I ventured to say, 'O, Sir, I cannot think Mr. Garrick would grudge such a trifle to you.' 'Sir, (said he, with a stern look,) I have known David Garrick longer than you have done: and I know no right you have to talk to me on the subject.' Perhaps I deserved this check; for it was rather presumptuous in me, an entire stranger, to express any doubt of the justice of his animadversion upon his old acquaintance and pupil.* I now felt myself much mortified, and began to think that the hope which I had long indulged of obtaining his acquaintance was blasted. And, in truth, had not my ardour been uncommonly strong, and my resolution uncommonly persevering, so rough a reception might have deterred me for ever from making any further attempts. Fortunately, however, I remained upon the field not wholly discomfited.\"3\"That creature Dickens, whose last story, Bleak House, I found accidentally at the London Library the other day and took home and read—much the worst of his things, and the only one of them I altogether dislike—has the vulgar impudence in this thing to ridicule rights of women. It is done in the very vulgarest way—just the style in which vulgar men used to ridicule 'learned ladies' as neglecting their children and household etc.\" JSM to Harriet Taylor4\"At seven o'clock this evening, being the seventh of December, I imagine I see you in your box at the coffee-house. No doubt the waiter, as ingenious and adroit as his predecessors were before him, raises the tea-pot to the ceiling with his right hand, while in his left the tea-cup descending almost to the floor, receives a limpid stream; limpid in its descent, but no sooner has it reached its destination, than frothing and foaming to the view, it becomes a roaring syllabub. This is the nineteenth winter since I saw you in this situation; and if nineteen more pass over me before I die, I shall still remember a circumstance we have often laughed at.\"5\"The state of slavery is of such a nature that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political, but only by positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasions, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory. It is so odious, that nothing can be suffered to support it, but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from the decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.\"6\"If it is law, it will be found in our books. If it is not to be found there, it is not law\".7\"in modern times the supposed marital exemption in rape forms no part of the law of England.\"8\"In England, amidst the clash of arms, the laws are not silent. They may be changed, but they speak the same language in war as in peace. It has always been one of the pillars of freedom, one of the principles of liberty for which on recent authority we are now fighting, that the judges are no respecters of persons, and stand between the subject and any attempted encroachments on his liberty by the executive, alert to see that any coercive action is justified in law.\"9\"Coleridge sat on the brow of Highgate Hill, in those years, looking down on London and its smoke-tumult, like a sage escaped from the inanity of life's battle; attracting towards him the thoughts of innumerable brave souls still engaged there. His express contributions to poetry, philosophy, or any specific province of human literature or enlightenment, had been small and sadly intermittent; but he had, especially among young inquiring men, a higher than literary, a kind of prophetic or magician character. He was thought to hold, he alone in England, the key of German and other Transcendentalisms; knew the sublime secret of believing by \"the reason\" what \"the understanding\" had been obliged to fling out as incredible; and could still, after Hume and Voltaire had done their best and worst with him, profess himself an orthodox Christian, and say and print to the Church of England, with its singular old rubrics and surplices at Allhallowtide, Esto perpetua. A sublime man; who, alone in those dark days, had saved his crown of spiritual manhood; escaping from the black materialisms, and revolutionary deluges, with \"God, Freedom, Immortality\" still his: a king of men. The practical intellects of the world did not much heed him, or carelessly reckoned him a metaphysical dreamer: but to the rising spirits of the young generation he had this dusky sublime character; and sat there as a kind of Magus, girt in mystery and enigma; his Dodona oak-grove (Mr. Gilman's house at Highgate) whispering strange things, uncertain whether oracles or jargon.\"Carlyle, Life of Sterling",

Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . This orbital confluence sets off a cosmic traffic jam. The tiny pieces of Swift-Tuttle, usually no bigger than a grain of sand, smash into Earth’s atmosphere at up to 37 miles per second and burn up, birthing what we know as shooting stars, as seen in this 2010 photo of the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile. Each year, the comet dust collides with our atmosphere between mid-July and late August. During the peak of this event, you can spot up to some 100 meteors per hour—if you’re lucky.The shower’s name, Perseid, is misleading: It’s borrowed from the far-off constellation Perseus, named after the Medusa-killing Greek legend, because the meteors look like they’re emerging from that point. But the streaks we see are usually just 60 miles from the Earth’s surface, rather than more than 200 million light-years away.If you’re game to go late-night meteor hunting, you might catch the maximum activity at around 3 to 4 a.m. Eastern, on August 13. Although plenty of specs will be burning through the atmosphere the night of August 12—and if you’re in the Southern Hemisphere, peak viewing is a night earlier. This year, the peak is slated for a few days after a full moon, so it’s possible that the lunar light obscures the shower. But you can get creative: Try to shield the moon’s glow by standing in a shadow, as suggested by EarthSky. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .

      "content": "Photo (modified) by UK Prime Minister, via Wikimedia CommonsIn a post a week ago, I shared some pretty startling numbers about the size of the AI-related capex boom:Source: Paul KedroskyIn fact, this boom is so big that in 2025 so far, AI-related investment has contributed more to economic growth than all the growth in consumer spending combined. Since consumption is more than three times as big as investment overall, this is a really startling fact — it means that consumption is sluggish, while AI capex is sustaining economic growth all by itself. Paul Kedrosky calls this a \"private sector stimulus program\", and he's not wrong. My last post asked whether a crash in the AI sector would hurt the U.S. economy. But there's another important question here, which is who is actually going to make a profit from all this spending. Will it be the AI model companies themselves, like OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic? Will it be the companies that provide the compute to train and run the AI models — Amazon, Microsoft, and Google? Will it just be the GPU companies like Nvidia that provide the physical infrastructure? The profit question is an important one if you're an investor, of course, since corporate valuations are (usually) based on how much profit companies make — not on how much they invest or how much total revenue they generate. But it's also important if we want to understand the social impact of the AI boom — in particular, the question of whether AI will lead to extreme economic inequality. There's a narrative out there that after AI takes everyone's jobs, the only people in society who will have money are the people who own the AI companies — the Sam Altmans and Elon Musks of the world, and perhaps the Satya Nadellas and Jensen Huangs. It's possible to spin sci-fi scenarios where the mass of humanity is impoverished and starving, while a few Robot Lords order their pet AI gods to use all of Earth's resources to colonize the Solar System. In reality, those scenarios would run into political problems (i.e., war) long before they came to pass. But it's important to ask whether that's the direction in which our economic system is naturally heading. Thomas Piketty, for instance, wrote that inequality in society tends to increase until some sort of major political event — war, revolution, etc. — forces it back down. Some people worry whether the AI boom will represent the fulfillment of that dark vision.It's worth it to note that so far, stock markets don't actually expect anything that extreme to happen. When you look at the price-to-earnings ratios of the major public AI-related companies, they're somewhat high but not particularly astronomical:Source: CompaniesMarketCap.comIf markets expected these companies to reap untold bonanzas of profit thanks to AI, they'd be valued at far greater ratios to their current earnings, because people would expect their earnings to grow very rapidly. As for OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic, their combined valuation is still less than $1 trillion; for comparison, Nvidia's current valuation is around $4.5 trillion. So markets also don't currently expect the big AI labs to make untold profits, either. As for the broader market, the PE ratio of the S&P 500 is around 30 — historically somewhat high, but not astronomically high. So we seem to have a disconnect between a popular narrative and market expectations. If AI is going to make all the money in the economy, why are markets not expecting companies to see truly wondrous profit growth? The answer, I think, is that markets are remembering something that popular commentary and folklore has forgotten — the importance of corporate competition in limiting capital income. Investors know that AI companies are going to compete with each other, and that this is going to limit how much they can profit from their creations.If you build lots of capital, the return on capital goes down Read more",

      "content": "In this issue: we summarize an essay, How To Do Words With Things, by French philosopher and anthropologist Bruno Latour. The original is presented as a fictionalized encounter that a future archaeologist has with an arcane object: the Berliner Doppelschlüssel (double-key).The Doppelschlüssel is a confounding object indeed: a large key with an unfamiliar symmetry, it has identical bits at both ends of its shank.As Latour jokes at the opening of his essay, it resembles one of the 'impossible objects' of French illustrator Jacques Carelman. In fact, this object is quite real and was in widespread use in apartment buildings in Berlin for much of the 20th century, especially in the period between the end of the Second World War and the building of the Berlin Wall. The Doppelschlüssel introduces and enforces a strict protocol for when residents must leave the street-level door to their apartment building unlocked and when they must lock it. As Latour puts it, this protocol might be verbalised as follows: \"Lock the door behind you during the night, and never during the day,\" or, more politically: \"Let us settle the class struggle between owners and tenants, rich people and thieves, right-wing Berliners and left-wing Berliners.\" Subscribe nowHow does it work?The Doppelschlüssel system consists of a special lock installed at the entrance to an apartment building; keys belonging to each resident; and a master key used by the apartment concierge. To understand how it works, picture a resident returning home during the hours of darkness.The resident inserts their key on the street side and turns it 270°, the bolt retracts and the door unlocks, allowing it to be opened. However, the resident cannot withdraw the key at this point – as they would from a normal lock – because a notch on the lock mechanism and a lip on the key prevent it.To retrieve their key, the resident must push the key *through* the lock to the courtyard side, still horizontal, and then – having themselves passed through the open door and into the courtyard – turn it back 270° to bolt the door again. Only after bolting the door from the courtyard side can they finally withdraw the key, leaving the door locked, exactly as they found it. The following morning, using the master key, the concierge changes the state of the lock to reverse the protocol. During the day, residents find that if they try to lock the door their keys cannot be withdrawn. Latour's discussionFor Latour, the Doppelschlüssel system is a 'program of action' that inflexibly prescribes how residents must interact with the door. Its rules actively shape and co-constitute social relations by inscribing a desired behaviour – prevent users from leaving the door unlocked at night or locking it during the day – into physical hardware.This protocol is not reducible to either social relations or technological features alone; it is a hybrid that blends both. Traditional methods like notices or verbal warnings typically fail to ensure that doors are locked properly at night, leading to security issues. This is because they depend on humans: fallible, distracted, forgetful, or with subversive intentions. The Doppelschlüssel system is a network of mediators – humans, objects, know-how, social practices and their consequences – that together enact a distributed protocol ensuring security and order. The double-key itself is a non-human actor imbued with agency: it makes social discipline possible by translating an ephemeral social rule into a durable, enforceable action sequence. Nonetheless, Latour points out the fragility and contingency of this protocol. The presence of the concierge's master key (with no lip) that can override the system shows how the chain of mediators can be altered or bypassed. Human actors at the protocol's core, like the concierge, must be disciplined to maintain the protocol's efficacy. Another stark vulnerability: if a savvy resident were to file away the lip from their key, it would functionally transform into a master key. Latour's discussion also reflects technological changes, such as the process by which mechanical keys have been replaced with electronic locks and pass codes, illustrating how protocols evolve and how social relations are continuously re-negotiated through new mediators, technologies, and sequences of actions.Latour's essay was originally published as 'Inscrire dans la nature des choses ou la clef berlinoise' in the French-language journal Alliages in 1990. An English translation by Lydia Davis was published as 'The Berlin Key or How To Do Words With Things,' in Paul Graves-Brown (ed.), Matter, Materiality and Modern Culture (London: Routledge, 1991), and the essay has been widely translated and published since.

The release went like this:Altman *official tone*: \"this is the most powerful ai model ever made. it also simplifies our product offering by automatically routing your queries to the adequate level of intelligence so that you can focus on your work. enjoy.\"Reddit: \"Wait—where's GPT-4o? How am I supposed to 'focus on my work' with this trash model? —How am I supposed to go on with this absurd, empty life without GPT-4o!!!\"Altman *to himself*: \"well, that escalated quickly... maybe i should've warned we'd do this for all 700 million users at once? i gueeeeess we're getting 4o back up.\"Altman *official tone*: \"ok, guys, we have listened to your helpful feedback and have made a hard but, we believe, correct decision: we're bringing back GPT-4o—\"Reddit: \"Long live our OpenAI saviors!!! Long live sama!!!\"Altman *official tone*: \"—for paid users.\"Reddit: ...Jokes aside, that's more or less what happened. There's a lot to unpack here:Why did OpenAI deprecate the old GPT models at once without a clear warning to the 699,850,000 ChatGPT weekly active users who didn't tune in to watch the release live? (Yes, around 150,000 people tuned in!)Why did the auto-switching mechanism fail, causing people to experience a significant quality decrease in their AI workflows?Why are there so many people obsessed with GPT-4o's personality to the point of being furious that GPT-5 has a different one, over it being worse at times. (Shouldn't surprise me, but wouldn't you prefer a model that pushed back rather than one who made you feel every random idea is the best idea ever?Why did OpenAI fold so quickly? Hadn't they considered the fact that people love sycophancy above performance (they have the data)? Wasn't that the reason why they made GPT-4o a sycophant in the first place?And finally: Why did they bring it back only for the 10-15 million users on the Plus tier, who spend $20/month on ChatGPT, ignoring the other 680+ million?If you take a closer look at the order in which I've asked these questions, you will realize I'm indirectly answering them all at once with: this was on purpose.Well, you making that inference is not my intention at all! I don't like conspiracy theories, and I will not tolerate any further accusations, so I better get rid of that nefarious and ill-intended interpretation right away: I don't think this was a carefully designed plot to send GPT-4o in the free tier to the paid tier (the conversion rate is around 2-3%, being generous), thus ramping up revenue, which OpenAI desperately needs. But alas, what can I do? Ultimately, I can't control what you want to believe, and this possibility is there anyway, so feel free to draw your unbiased conclusions.Let's keep going. What actually happened with the GPT-5 release?High expectations are never met, but it started really badly, with memes about the misnumbered charts and mischarted numbers. It continued with people extending their AGI timelines (or collapsing them) as a response to a better model. (Others are wisely waiting for the next s-curve in the chain of s-curves.) I then wrote about the benefits of raising the floor of capabilities, but who cares, right? Give us AGI already. After the demo, GPT-5 started severely misbehaving, with plenty of users mocking its dumb responses and the rest surprised they hadn't received a heads-up. It was collectively marked as \"disappointing\" (as I had predicted).Redditors were equal parts furious and flabbergasted: \"What the hell is going on, fellow Redditors? How do they dare do this to us?\" they wondered out loud, ready to cancel the Singularity party they'd been planning for twenty years and raise up in arms instead. Thankfully, the OpenAI team set up an \"Ask Me Anything\" session to gather feedback. \"They will clarify this obvious mistake,\" Redditors reasoned. And, in typical herd fashion, they demanded one thing: bring back GPT-4o right now. I am not exaggerating. Look at this (read the comments in full, please, I think this will change your experience of this article and your overall perspective on AI companions):And I stopped scrolling (this is one post on one subreddit; imagine this multiplied by 700 million weekly active users). Naturally, seeing the huge backlash on both Twitter and Reddit—the two online sites the AI industry cares about—Sam Altman responded: We're looking into it.Not long after, he tweeted, among other updates: \"We will let Plus users choose to continue to use 4o. We will watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models for.\" This means those paying at least $20/month (i.e., 2-3% of the total user base). The positive reaction was immediate, which reveals that Reddit users pay for ChatGPT and also that their dependence on it is genuine (some users noted Altman's \"for how long\" qualification and pushed back further). Look:And then, of course, the damned free ChatGPT users responded:Well, that was... intense.Let's parse Altman's tweet before analyzing Reddit's reaction. The first part (\"We will let Plus users choose to continue to use 4o\") reveals they can't afford to lose user revenue (remember, they're running at a loss despite the constant growth in paying users; besides, they have a country to rebuild). It also means that people want to use worse models or OpenAI wouldn't fold (which makes me realize that most people care neither about the ceiling of capabilities rising—that's for the AGI evangelists—nor the floor of capabilities rising—which I care about—but about the walls being full of candy!).It also means, by extension, that OpenAI will keep AGI (the real kind, not the fake kind) on the roadmap, provided the road pays for itself: it must spin off that juicy revenue from people who prefer a much-dumber-than-AGI model. Isn't this a dilemma of sorts? Where does OpenAI lie in the trade-off between supporting the expensive, backward-looking requests of 700 million users vs. actually devoting the compute resources to build AGI? This conundrum reminds me that I already know the answer:What I worry about is that if they don't reach their AGI goals, they will settle for the next best thing. The next best thing for them, which is terrible for us: Right before \"making tons of money to redistribute to all of humanity through AGI,\" there's another step, which is making tons of money. It's not always about the money, until money is the only thing you can aspire to. The AI industry will gladly compromise the long-term mission to squeeze a bit more out of those engagement-optimized products. If they can't win for all, they will win for themselves.The second part of Altman's tweet (\"We will watch usage as we think about how long to offer legacy models for\") means they plan to eventually not offer legacy models, which means, in turn, that they have to find a way to imbue sycophantic behavior into at least one of the models underlying GPT-5 (remember, there's a switch between different models but they're all called GPT-5). If they granted so quickly the request to bring back GPT-4o, it's because the main principle that rules OpenAI's decisions—as a for-profit business rather than an AGI lab—is this: give people what they want.Having witnessed the reaction to losing and then getting back GPT-4o, I think it's important to consider why people want that. I imagine part of the reason is that GPT-5, as the imposed replacement to 4o, was genuinely malfunctioning yesterday (was the auto-switch broken, or working as intended, which simply happens to be in a suboptimal way?). But another part is, obviously, its personality: 4o is a friend, a companion, a lover; some want it to live forever, some need it to live themselves. People just love the sycophantic personality. Two things I've written elsewhere reflect my takeaway on this (the first is from July 3rd, and the second from April 29th; the reverse chronological order is intentional):ChatGPT's constant sycophancy is annoying for the power users who want it to do actual work, but not for the bulk of users who want entertainment or company. Most people are dying to have their ideas validated by a world that mostly ignores them. Confirmation bias (tendency to believe what you already believe) + automation bias (tendency to believe what a computer says) + isolation + an AI chatbot that constantly reinforces whatever you say = an incredibly powerful recipe for psychological dependence and thus user retention and thus money.If we were to believe that crazy conspiracy theory I described above (Reminder: I don't), it's almost as if I predicted the exact manual OpenAI had to follow. Now the other excerpt, from two months earlier:One of the observations I made in my article about AI companions [this one] is that we want \"honesty-disguised adulation.\" I firmly believe this is true, but I added: only if the camouflage is sufficiently good. This difference is fundamental, because if there's one thing we hate more than absolute honesty, it's sycophancy we can see for what it is. It reveals to us, by opposition, what we truly are. And at the same time, it shows us, on the one hand, that we're being lied to, and on the other—perhaps the worst part of this psychological tangle—that the person lying to us thinks we aren't capable of handling the candid truth.You can almost sense how I lost the confidence and hope in humanity between April and July. I started with \"Haha, obvious sycophancy—who'd want that? We can handle the candid truth just fine!\" and ended at \"Of course, OpenAI is doing this to make money because people will pay their lives away to be somewhat flattered.\"And there's something else that I didn't quite bring myself to accept in the second paragraph above because my hope for humanity was clouding my judgment; for the average person, the hierarchy of needs actually goes like this: honesty-disguised adulation > obvious adulation >>> absolute sincerity. For many people, obvious adulation is strictly better than absolute sincerity. People need GPT-4o because they can't withstand pushback, or rather, they can't handle the candid truth:. . . OpenAI knows it can't afford to alienate its average user (we might call this new business direction at OpenAI the \"tyranny of the average user\"). For the average user, absolute sincerity isn't just worse than absolute adulation—no matter how tiresome sycophancy might feel when pushed to extremes—it's unacceptable in itself; reason enough to abandon the product in favor of a competitor's.On the topic of whether this sycophantic behavior was an emergent personality trait or something OpenAI, if even slightly, steered the model toward, we can resort to the words of Mikhail Parakhin, former lead at Microsoft Bing who had a close relationship with OpenAI developers: humans are \"ridiculously sensitive\" to fully honest opinions of others. We take it \"as someone insulting you.\"So, I do believe OpenAI is ruled by the tyranny of the average user who is now asking en masse for GPT-4o to be reinstated. I also believe that the characteristic sycophancy of that model is at least partially intended and an indirect consequence of that same tyranny: OpenAI never thought it was a problem in itself; the problem was that it was blatant. It was a failure of execution, not principle. But their assessment, like mine, was mistaken. People are telling them, more clearly than I thought possible: No, no, no—we want GPT-4o's sycophancy as blatant as you can give us. So OpenAI, intimidated by the tyranny of the average user, obliges.You can attribute responsibility as you see fit. To OpenAI's credit, Altman himself acknowledged the problem, and a member of the technical staff later stated the company had tried to reduce the sycophancy, even resorting to an earlier GPT-4o checkpoint. Unfortunately, it didn't work. Still, in the months that followed, OpenAI executives have insisted that they truly want to get rid of this annoying personality trait for good. Unfortunately, as Altman confessed on the \"Huge Conversations\" podcast this week, it's the users who have been resistant (\"Me? Guilty? But it's the addicts who ask me for drugs!!!\"):Here is the heartbreaking thing. I think it is great that ChatGPT is less of a yes man and gives you more critical feedback, but as we've been making those changes and talking to users about it, it's so sad to hear users say, 'Please can I have it back? I've never had anyone in my life be supportive of me. I never had a parent tell me I was doing a good job.'There's young people who say things like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me, it knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.I genuinely believe Altman thinks the consequences of ChatGPT's yes-man attitude are \"heartbreaking\" and \"sad\" and \"really bad.\" I don't see him identifying with the people who say they want or need unwarranted validation or he wouldn't be where he is today, leading his awesome AI company! He probably doesn't like the coverage coming from the New York Times and Rolling Stone on the delusions and psychosis some users are reporting as a result of their interactions with ChatGPT, either. (There's a new article by the NYT on this that was published on Friday.) I'm sure he hates the fact that all that has come to light and that now he has to bring back GPT-4o for paid users—the tyranny of the average user, man, too damn strong.Anyway, now that I've written all of this—and given that writing is, as masters of the craft like to say, another way of thinking—I've come to think that maybe that conspiracy theory above has more merit than I originally attributed.Let me share with you a non-exhaustive list of unrelated statements: OpenAI has been bleeding talent for years now, most of it gone to competitors (e.g., Anthropic, Meta) or to found new ones (e.g., Thinking Machines and SSI). The scaling laws are yielding diminishing returns, which brought the AI field back to a state of pure scientific research rather than just development and production, which are more engineering-based (where OpenAI used to hold a first-mover advantage). Another first mover advantage is the ChatGPT brand and recent stats reveal that OpenAI's main revenue source is people paying directly to access the app/website, either as standalone users or as businesses (Anthropic, for instance, is more of a B2B company through the Claude API and Google/Meta are advertising companies disguised as hard tech). Besides, the evals are saturating, the capital expenditures are rising faster than the capability ceiling, and although hallucinations and unreliability are lower, they're far from zero. Final, unrelated statement: the OpenAI guys are marketing masters, and Altman himself is, as stated by former colleagues, hard to trust.OpenAI has many hard ways to keep growing its revenue; OpenAI has one easy way to keep growing its revenue. Is that enough to believe absurd stories? I must insist: as a rational person, I won't be convinced that there's an ongoing plan to lure free users to pay for a software product. That just never happens! Or wait—now that it is back, why not ask 4o for honest feedback on this random idea of mine...",

A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside. After that, silence.-C.S. Lewis, A Grief ObservedThe question of why God allows suffering has been posed by both believers and atheists alike for centuries. That's why in 1940, C.S. Lewis set out to finally answer it with his book The Problem of Pain. In it, he offered a robust explanation of why a loving God exists even in a world filled with suffering.But 20 years later, Lewis's theory was put to the ultimate test. When his wife died, Lewis was forced to wrestle with the ideas he had previously outlined so deftly — but he found the practice much harder than the theory.Originally published under a pseudonym, A Grief Observed is the work that resulted from Lewis's anguish, a book compiled from the notebooks he kept following the death of his wife. In writing this work, Lewis discovered something that changed his entire understanding of God and the problem of pain.Today, we explore Lewis's journey through grief and what it can teach you about pain, lamentation, and love — and most importantly, where God is in the midst of it all...Reminder: this is a teaser of our members-only deep dives.To support our mission and get our premium content every week, upgrade for a few dollars per month. You'll get:Full-length, deep-dive articles every weekendThe entire archive of great literature, art, and philosophy breakdownsMembers-only podcasts and exclusive interviewsSubscribe nowThe Power of PainBefore diving into Lewis's work, it is important to note a small detail: the inclusion of the article \"A\" in the book's title. This detail, like so many of those in Lewis's writing, is intentional — it reminds the reader that the book's contents do not presume to document the only way in which grief is experienced, but rather one specific experience among many.That said, A Grief Observed is famous for its wide-ranging appeal and ability to connect with others who experience grief in different ways. Perhaps this is because the central concepts transcend the specific details of suffering itself — for example, one of the main themes is about how, throughout your life, your idea of God is repeatedly being shattered.My idea of God is not a divine idea. It has to be shattered time after time. He shatters it Himself. He is the great iconoclast. Could we not almost say that this shattering is one of the marks of His presence?-C.S. Lewis, A Grief ObservedThe first \"shattering\", Lewis states, occurred in the Incarnation, when God became man and united both divine and human nature in the person of Jesus. He goes on to write that one's view of God is often shattered in private prayer — and so too, of course, in pain.This shattering is ultimately a good thing though, because it destroys incorrect beliefs you have both about God and yourself; beliefs that keep you from becoming who you're truly meant to be. In this sense, Lewis says that pain serves to capture one's attention — in The Problem of Pain, he originally phrased this idea as such:God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.In A Grief Observed, however, Lewis's tone shifts to better reflect what the sensation of this shattering feels like. Here he phrases it bluntly:Man has to be knocked silly before he comes to his senses.But of course, being \"knocked silly\" is a painful experience, and this experience can easily lead one to doubt God's goodness. This is where Lewis insists on the importance of believing that \"God hurts only to heal.\"To be clear, this does not mean that God himself causes suffering — but once a tragedy occurs, God sees you through it. In this sense, Lewis writes, God is like a battlefield surgeon, saving a man who, because of enemy fire, must now have his leg amputated in order to live:The more we believe that God hurts only to heal, the less we can believe that there is any use in begging for tenderness. A cruel man might be bribed...But suppose that what you are up against is a surgeon whose intentions are wholly good. The kinder and more conscientious he is, the more inexorably he will go on cutting. If he yielded to your entreaties, if he stopped before the operation was complete, all the pain up to that point would have been useless.Up to this point in the book, Lewis has primarily addressed only the emotional pain caused by grief and loss. But that pain, if not managed properly, leads to more anguish — it's an anguish caused by despair, and is something Lewis comes to know only too well...The Danger of DespairNo one told me that grief felt so like fear. I am not afraid, but the sensation is like being afraid. The same fluttering in the stomach, the same restlessness...I dread the moments the house is empty.-C.S. Lewis, A Grief ObservedThroughout A Grief Observed, Lewis makes no secret of his struggle with faith. He tries to turn to God, but feels as though God either isn't there, or doesn't care about him. In one moment of pain, he describes this frustrating struggle as such:Why is [God] so present a commander in our time of prosperity and so very absent a help in time of trouble? I tried to put some of these thoughts to C. this afternoon. He reminded me that the same thing seems to have happened to Christ: 'Why hast thou forsaken me?' I know. Does that make it easier to understand?As Lewis grows weary from this frustration, his pain slowly morphs into despair. This marks Lewis's descent to the lowest point on his journey of grief, because while sadness can be endured, despair is what truly destroys you. The former is a passing emotion, but the latter is a declaration of terror — a statement that life is painful, irredeemable, and not worth living. This, in Lewis's experience, is worse than not believing in God:Not that I am (I think) in much danger of ceasing to believe in God. The real danger is of coming to believe such dreadful things about Him. The conclusion I dread is not 'So there's no God after all,' but 'So this is what God's really like. Deceive yourself no longer'...So how does Lewis handle the temptation to succumb to despair?He begins by turning to an ancient and biblical response to suffering — and although counter-intuitive, it is ultimately what gets him through his grief, deepens his faith, and helps him to see the goodness of life itself...

Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Millionaire on billionaire violence (permalink) For the past year, I've been increasingly fascinated by a political mystery: how has antitrust enforcement become a global phenomenon after spending 40-years in a billionaire-induced coma? https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting Political scientists will tell you that policies that billionaires hate will not ever be enacted by politicians, no matter how popular they are among the public: https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B And yet, all around the world – the US (under Trump I, Biden and Trump II), Canada, the UK, the EU, Japan, South Korea, Australia, even China – governments have done more on antitrust over the past couple years than over the past four decades. Where is this coming from? My working theory basically boiled down to \"enough is enough\" – AKA Stein's Law: \"Anything that can't go on forever eventually stops.\" As in: people are just so pissed off with corporate power that politicians are finally acting to curb it. But I was never very satisfied with this. There's lots of stuff that the public is furious about, which politicians aren't acting on, from climate change to taxing billionaires. Why antitrust and not all that stuff? https://pluralistic.net/2025/08/07/the-people-no-2/#water-flowing-uphill I've been mulling this over, and I got to thinking about a low-key disagreement I used to have with comrades in the digital human rights world, just before all the antitrust stuff really kicked off: https://memex.craphound.com/2019/06/04/why-is-there-so-much-antitrust-energy-for-big-tech-but-not-for-big-telco/ Back then, people on the same side as the barricades as me were deeply suspicious of antitrust. They thought that the bubbling policy revival for antitrust was a way for phone and cable companies to enlist the government to go after their adversaries in the tech world, against whom they were (badly) losing the Net Neutrality fight: https://www.techdirt.com/2019/06/04/if-big-tech-is-huge-antitrust-problem-why-are-we-ignoring-telecom/ Back then, my thesis was, Sure, maybe Big Telco is pushing for antitrust to target Big Tech, but once antitrust arises from its long slumber, it will turn on telcos – and every other concentrated industry. Tldr: I'm pretty sure that's what's happening. You see, one part of the antitrust battle boils down to a fight between rentiers and capitalists. The largest tech (and other) companies are primarily rentiers – entities that make money by owning things, rather than doing things. They make rents, at the expense of other companies' profits: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/28/cloudalists/#cloud-capital Companies like Epic (makers of Fortnite) want to sell your kids skins and mods for their in-game avatars without giving Apple and Google 30% of every dollar that brings in, and they've got a lot of money to make that desire real: https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2025/07/31/24-6256.pdf This is millionaire-on-billionaire violence. It's gigantic corporations going to war against galactic-scale corporations. These pro-antitrust companies are the inheritors of the telcos' mantle, powerful belligerents in a Extremely Large Tech war on Big Tech. There are a lot of these large companies and they're sick of being subjected to a 30% economy-wide App Tax on all the payments they receive in-app: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/01/its-not-the-crime/#its-the-coverup Let me be clear: I'm not saying that the only reason we're getting muscular, global anti-monopoly action is that slightly smaller corporations (who universally aspire to acquiring monopolies of their own) are fighting for their own self-interest. What I'm saying is that the coalition of everyday people who've had their lives ruined by monopolists and corporations that are stuck paying the app tax (and the 51% tax that Google/Meta take out of every ad-tech dollar, the 45-51% Amazon takes out of every e-commerce dollar, and the sums that Tiktok, Twitter and Meta extort from business customers to \"boost\" in order to reach their own followers) is, in combination, sufficient to awaken the antitrust giant. Members of the public are critical to this fight – we're the ones who tip the scales from one side to the other. That's why rentiers go to such great lengths to convince policymakers that they have the public on their side, whether that's Amazon trotting out \"small businesses\" that depend on (and get viciously fucked by) Amazon's ecommerce platform: https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/4760357-amazon-basics-antitrust/ Or leaders of groups like the NAACP who've been bribed to front for the phone companies and cable operators in the fight against Net Neutrality: https://www.techdirt.com/2017/12/19/naacp-fought-net-neutrality-until-last-week-now-suddenly-supports-idea/ All other things being equal, policymakers will simply side the deepest-pocketed, most unified corporate lobby in any fight (which is how the media companies won the Napster Wars). But when the public and one side of the corporate world is one side of an issue, policymakers understand that siding with them will get them votes and money, which is much better than just getting money (which is how we won the SOPA/PIPA fight): https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/everyone-made-themselves-hero-remembering-aaron-swartz We can really see this in the EU, where the new Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act are going after Big Tech with both barrels, with the enthusiastic support of the EU's tech industry. That's because the EU's tech industry barely registers when placed alongside of US Big Tech, which has sucked up nearly 100% of the market oxygen by cheating (on privacy, taxes, wages, etc). Despite the farcical efforts of US tech shills like Nick Clegg (former UK Deputy Prime Minister turned Meta shill, who insisted that Facebook was \"defending European cyberspace from Chinese communism\"), everyone knew that US tech companies were extracting (billions of euros and the personal information of 500m Europeans) from the bloc and siphoning it off to America, after first cleansing it of any tax obligations by laundering it through Ireland and the Netherlands. If Europe still had thriving tech \"national champions\" – Olivetti, Nokia, Deutsche Telekom, Ericsson, etc – these companies might plausibly mount an opposition to muscular tech regulation in the EU. But these companies were crippled by predatory capital and then mostly absorbed into US Big Tech (or ground into dust). Back when I was having a friendly blog-argument with my comrades about whether tech antitrust was a Big Telco plot, I averred that it didn't really matter, because Big Tech really was terrible, and because once we'd roused antitrust enforcement from its 40-year slumber, we could wrest control of it from the telecoms monopolists who'd helped us dig it up and reanimate it. In other words: the war against the corruption brought about by corporate concentration is hard to kindle, but it's even harder to extinguish. The corporations that are fanning the flames are focused – as corporations inevitably are, to the detriment of our planet and politics – on the short term gains they stand to reap from their actions. But we can – we must – take the long view. Smashing corporate power is the key to destroying fascism and ensuring our species' survival, so our focus needs to be on building the blaze, and if some of those adding fuel to the fire happen to aspire to building monopolies of their own, then our job is to give 'em a nasty surprise when that day comes.

This week we look at microplastics in the air, the Blanchard lathe, the report on the OceanGate sub disaster, a plan to visit a black hole, and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.Some housekeeping items:IFP is partnering with Matt Yglesias to solicit ideas for improving federal mass transit policy. If you have an idea for improving mass transit policy, submit a proposal here.I had planned to publish a piece on the nature of technological progress this week, but it didn't quite come together the way I hoped, so I'm currently reworking it.SpinlaunchRockets are a difficult way of putting objects into space. In addition to the technological difficulties inherent in controlling an exploding river of hot gasses, rockets have the unfortunate property that each additional bit of mass launched requires more fuel to lift it, which then requires more fuel to lift that fuel, and so on (a mechanism described as the tyranny of the rocket equation). The result is that rocket payload fractions are a single digit percent of total rocket mass.Via Wikipedia.There's thus perennial interest in finding ways to put objects into orbit other than using rockets. One such idea is to use a huge gun to launch a projectile into orbit. This idea has a long history (it's used to launch a spacecraft in Jules Verne's 1865 From the Earth to the Moon), and there have been various attempts to build a gun that could launch a projectile into space.A current attempt to launch a projectile into space is Spinlaunch which, per the name, wants to launch satellites using a huge centrifuge. (This doesn't completely eliminate the need for a rocket, but will apparently greatly reduce the fuel requirements.) Wired has a long profile of the company:The idea that an object weighing thousands of pounds can punch its way into space after spinning in circles on Earth's surface can be hard to fathom. It might even sound crazy, and the company has a lot to prove to shake its critics. So far it has managed to spin an 11-pound dummy payload at more than 4,000 mph and send it crashing into a steel wall. Between those tests and the edge of space, however, are roughly a hundred miles and a whole lot of air resistance. Never mind the engineering work needed to build a centrifuge 100 yards wide, with an arm strong enough to support a roughly SUV-sized rocket.Yaney hopes this is the year he achieves vindication. The company plans to conduct its first suborbital launches this winter at a new test site in New Mexico. Assuming the system works, Spinlaunch promises to reduce the cost of sending small satellites into space by a factor of almost 20. But the bigger deal may be its launch cadence. Yaney predicts the mass accelerator will be able to do five launches a day; most rocket companies can't do that many launches in a month. In the era of mega-satellite constellations, which will see thousands of small satellites sent to low Earth orbit over the next decade, Yaney believes Spinlaunch's time has come.Ozimek on the US car industryAdam Ozimek of the Economic Innovation Group has an interesting paper on the evolution of the US auto industry, and whether it needs protection from foreign competition. Among other things, he argues that despite common perception, the industry hasn't collapsed: output has been steady by number of cars and has greatly increased by value add. Rather, it was Detroit specifically that collapsed, as car manufacturers moved production to elsewhere in the US:The historical record paints the picture. Henry Ford II announced in 1950 that his company's investments would no longer be concentrated in their established industrial centers. By the mid1960s, Ford had made major investments not just in the southern states of Alabama, Tennessee, and Georgia, but also in New York and New Jersey.For its part, GM made investments in Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, New Jersey, Mississippi, andCalifornia, while Chrysler invested in New York, Delaware, Indiana, and Ohio — all by the late 1950s.These investments and the jobs that followed them did not occur as a result of foreign car companies establishing their factories in the south and other parts of the country. That came much later. Long before the Big 3 were seriously challenged by foreign automakers, they themselves had begun decentralizing auto investment out the industrial hub of Michigan and spreading jobs and investment across the rest of the country.So globalization couldn't kill Detroit because Detroit was already dead. Or at least dying.And it really was a story of decline in Detroit almost exclusively. From 1950 to 1980, autoemployment even in most of the Rust Belt states expanded. The gains in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois exceeded those of any southern state.Air microplasticsAn occasional topic of interest around here is indoor air quality: I've previously written about how UV light could be used to help prevent future pandemics by killing airborne pathogens, and whether there are negative cognitive effects from carbon dioxide.This PLOS ONE paper has put another indoor air pollutant on my radar: microplastics. From the abstract:The ubiquitous presence of airborne microplastics (MPs) in different indoor environments prompts serious concerns about the degree to which we inhale these particles and their potential impact on human health. Previous studies have mostly targeted MP in the 20–200 µm size range, which are less likely to efficiently penetrate into the lungs. In this study, we specifically investigate airborne, indoor suspended MPs in the inhalable 1–10 µm (MP1–10 µm) range in residential and car cabin environments, by using Raman spectroscopy. The median concentration of total suspended indoor MPs for the residential environment was 528 MPs/m3 and 2,238 MPs/m3 in the car cabin environment. The predominant polymer type in the residential environment was polyethylene (PE), and polyamide (PA) in the car cabin environment. Fragments were the dominant shape for 97% of the analyzed MPs, and 94% of MPs were smaller than 10 µm (MP1–10 µm), following a power size distribution law (the number of MP fragments increases exponentially as particle size decreases). We combine the new MP1–10 µm observations with published indoor MP data to derive a consensus indoor MP concentration distribution, which we use to estimate human adult indoor MP inhalation of 3,200 MPs/day for the 10–300 µm (MP10–300 µm) range, and 68,000 MPs/day for MP1–10 µm. The MP1–10 µm exposure estimates are 100-fold higher than previous estimates that were extrapolated from larger MP sizes, and suggest that the health impacts of MP inhalation may be more substantial than we realize.Note that I haven't read this paper closely, and these sorts of findings sometimes turn out to be overblown or incorrect. (Cremieux notes, for instance, that a widely-referenced paper blaming asthma on gas stoves turned out to be incorrect.) But particles in the air will in general cause health problems, so if there are many more plastic particles in the air than previously realized that seems likely to be bad.Blanchard latheIf you read much on the history of American invention, you'll quickly come across mention of the Blanchard lathe, a clever invention made in the early 19th century for manufacturing gunstocks. The lathe used an existing gunstock as a cam mechanism: as the existing gunstock rotates, it pushes against a movable arm connected to a saw. The path of the saw movement matches the shape of the existing gunstock, and can cut a piece of wood into the same shape.Blanchard lathe, via Wikipedia.Most discussions of the lathe only mention its invention, but apparently such lathes remained in use well into the 20th century. On Twitter, hw97karbine posts a video of a Blanchard lathe being used to manufacture the stock for a German Karabiner 98k around 1939. Read more",

      "content": "Steps are events, experiments, miniature rebellions against gravity and chance. With each step, we fall and then we catch ourselves, we choose to go one way and not another. The foot falls and worlds of possibility rise in its shadow. Every step remaps the psychogeography of the walker. Every step in space is also a step in time, slicing through the twilight between the half-fathomed past and the unfathomed future — a verse in the poetry of prospection. We walk the world to discover it and in the process discover ourselves. Craig Mod was nineteen when he moved from small-town America to Japan's majestic Kii Peninsula and began walking, only to find himself face to face with the questions he had tried to leave behind — what it means to forgive, what it takes to constellate a family beyond biology, how to live with the ghosts that haunt the history of the heart and the history of the world. These questions quiver alive in Things Become Other Things (public library) — part memoir of the search for belonging, part love letter to his childhood best friend, who \"bled out on a dirt yard under the stars\" when the boys were teenagers, part record of alchemizing loss into a largeness of being by learning \"to walk, and walk well, and witness the people along the way.\" Spring Moon at Ninomiya Beach, 1931 — one of Hasui Kawase's vintage Japanese woodblocks. (Available as a print.) Craig considers the primal nature of \"this simple impulse to traverse dirt, to push on the edges of what’s known to us,\" the strangeness of being impelled \"to walk and walk alone and do so for days and weeks and months at a time\": I’ve come to crave the solitude and asceticism of these solo walks. There is no quieter place on earth than the third hour of a good long day of walking. It’s alone in this space, this walk-induced hypnosis, that the mind is finally able to receive the strange gifts and charities of the world. In a sentiment evocative of Nabokov's insistence that \"an active and creative reader is a rereader,\" he adds: I’ve come to realize the only true walk is the re-walk. You cannot know a place without returning. And even then, once isn’t enough. That’s why I’m back. Back on the Peninsula. Walking these roads I’ve walked before. It’s only through time and distance and effort — concerted, present effort, controlled attention, a gentle and steady gaze upon it all — that you begin to understand old connections, old wounds. That the shape of once-dark paths becomes clear. Over and over he confronts the old wound of his origins — carried by \"someone nameless, faceless, someone pregnant at thirteen,\" raised by a mother whose husband left her shortly after the adoption to become a halfway father flitting in and out of Craig's childhood, too absent to be a parent, too present to be a stranger. Looking back on the longing to break free from his addiction to anger and blame, Craig writes: How could I be sure I was free? So I walked. I walk. I walk and I walk and I walk and feel the air of our town leave my cells and be replaced by the air and ideas of a different time and place. The more I breathe this Peninsula air, the more I realize that it would have been so easy to have elevated my father as a child. This shocks me, the first time I feel this on the road: the space in my heart for forgiveness — forgiveness! The moment I felt that was like getting hit in the head with a basketball — a freakish pang, a dull ache in the skull. I almost fell into a bush. I was hyperventilating — realizing my heart had expanded in some immeasurable, beyond-physics way that hearts can expand, and in that expansion I had new space. There’s a word in Japanese that sums up this feeling better than anything in English: yoyū. A word that somehow means: the excess provided when surrounded by a generous abundance. It can be applied to hearts, wallets, Sunday afternoons, and more... This extra space, this yoyū, this abundance... carried with it patience and — gasp — maybe even... love? Art from What Color Is the Wind? by Anne Herbauts Rising from the pages is a prayer for abundance against the backdrop of all that is taken away, an insistence on the possibility of finding beauty amid the ruins of our hopes. As he walks, Craig encounters \"moss lush enough to lie down on naked and wilt in reverence\"; he watches mountain crabs move like Claymation as they emerge from the wet forest at sunrise \"as if birthed by the light of day\"; he comes face to face with the unblinking kamoshika — the Japanese goat-like antelope, exuding \"an aura of magic in how fast and sure-footed it is,\" this most alien and holiest of forest animals; he feels the primal consolation of his own animal nature, this biped whose peripatetic balance has been honed by myriad exquisite evolutionary adaptations, tiny structures shaped over eons to do one thing perfectly, elaborate chemistries mixed in the cauldron of time to translate the laws of physics into flesh: I think about how a walk begins, with balance, in the ear, vestibular, a few feet above the earth... Endolymph, a potassium-heavy fluid, oozes inside the so-called bony and membranous labyrinthine canals of the inner ear.... inside [which] gelatinous bulbs called cupula, attached to stereocilia, detect the sloshing of our endolymph. The body moves, the endolymph splashes, heeds the laws of gravity. The stereocilia bend and transmit details of the bend — how far, how quickly, which orientation — to the cerebellum, the brain-nugget secreted at the back of the noggin. The cerebellum decodes the signals, translates, makes a follow-up microsecond game plan. The great reward is that each step can be such a cosmos of complexity and at the same time lead to such simple, elemental truths. Having distilled the core tenet of a good walk to \"real-time observation of unfiltered life,\" having observed the core tenet of life in the Kii Peninsula — \"a pervasive care throughout generations, a sense of knowing your happiness and health are intertwingled with those of your neighbor\" — Craig captures an evanescent moment shimmering with the eternal: Silent morning, abundant sunlight, abundant life. Thinking about this care. Water in the fields rippling in the wind. Mountains of Kii all around, a silent sloshing in my head, keeping the sky up and the ground down. Autumn Moon over Tama River by Utagawa Hiroshige, 1838. (Available as a print and a postcard.) Traversing these enchanted landscapes via historic routes and backroads, passing through small towns vanishing before his eyes with depopulation, staying in thousand-year-old temples, he meets and walks with people who end up becoming family — father-figures, brother-figures, elderly innkeepers who put the hardest truths in simple words annealed in the hearth of living. One tells him of the young woman who wandered in years earlier looking for work and turned into a daughter. \"Time passes, life moves, and that’s what happens,\" the old man tells him. \"Things become... other things.\" Looking back on half a lifetime of walking his own way to belonging, Craig reflects: Somehow as an adult I’ve managed to attract and surround myself with these people, these beacons of good... I love them so much that my bones ache — ache because I know I’ll lose them someday. I will follow them anywhere. Together we walk in the near-frozen morning air and the sun rises. Light works its way across the rippling peaks of the Peninsula. Feeling returns to hands, to feet, to hearts. The mind moves once again. We carry our lives on our backs and traverse the spine of the world, no humans for miles, no routes down, just forward or back, the beast below always shifting, always ready to heave us off.

Let us know what you think about the piece or share what's on your mind.Subscribe nowThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said it will hire up to 450 employees for the National Weather Service (NWS) after the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cut around 800 staff members earlier this year. The Trump administration approved the hires Wednesday as an exemption to the hiring freeze in place through October 15, 2025.The administration's move arrives as both wildfire and hurricane seasons begin to peak and follows increased scrutiny over layoffs after floods in Texas killed at least 135 people last month.Alan Gerard, a retired NOAA meteorologist, said the effects of federal cuts and chaotic buyouts are still rippling through the agency and will leave communities more vulnerable to extreme weather, despite the new round of hires.\"They already had those experienced people there, and they got rid of them, and now they're having to go back and hire new people,\" he said. \"They've essentially gotten rid of hundreds of years of experience.\" Mr. Gerard spent 35 years at NOAA, but accepted early retirement in March when he said it became clear that the Trump administration had plans to eliminate NOAA's research offices. He said that between layoffs and retirements, his office lost close to 15% of its staff. He now runs Balanced Weather, where he writes about the science of meteorology and climate change, significant weather events, and federal weather policy.While the administration's latest hiring announcement is a step toward rebuilding capacity, Mr. Gerard said that there are still gaps in the weather service's ability to accurately predict and warn people about weather events.NWS offices perform upper air balloon releases twice a day to gather atmospheric data, which feeds computer models that generate weather forecasts. Mr. Gerard said that one risk of the service's short staffing is some offices cannot perform their intended releases. He said that at the height of the NWS's spring chaos, he knew of offices that were, on some days, unable to release any balloons at all. If there are multiple offices in concentrated areas that are missing releases, he explained, there is a significant risk that they could fail to make an accurate forecast.It is particularly troubling to Mr. Gerard that NOAA and NWS are down dozens of electronics technicians, who are responsible, in part, for maintaining the Doppler radar network. He explained that the technology, though sometimes updated, is from the 1980s and 90s and requires highly trained experts to keep the radars operating accurately and showing incoming weather patterns.\"Having experience on it is really invaluable to keep it operating the way it's supposed to,\" he said.Mr. Gerard said that the initial cuts to NOAA have stunted the agency's ability to provide necessary information and adequately prepare Americans.\"Even if they hire 450 new people, they are not going to be in position to help this year.\"Subscribe now",

At its core is a miniscule piece of harmless genetic code that can help train the body to fight off pathogens. And now the current United States Health and Human Services Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has pulled the plug on hundreds of millions of dollars of research funding to further this life-saving advance. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . We’re talking, of course, about mRNA vaccines, which first became widely available to the public in December 2020, a ray of hope in the darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic. But the research to ensure their efficacy and safety had started long before COVID changed the world—in the 1980s. Because, as it happens, research takes time. And money.The COVID pandemic ramped up research and helped refine the unique technology to bring it into the mainstream, ultimately saving tens of millions of lives around the world. Public health experts argue that mRNA vaccines are especially crucial because they can be adjusted quickly to target emerging viral foes—which is why they advocate for continued funding of this research.But first, a little vaccine primer. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . How vaccines workPathogens—whether they cause COVID or influenza, measles or polio—contain antigens, which signal to the body whether or not something is harmful. If a pathogen is harmful, the presence of those antigens prompts the body to make antibodies, which work with the immune systems to kill off the invader. They also prepare the body so the next time that particular assailant attempts to infiltrate, the immune system is ready to jump into action to fend it off.But we can often skip that first round of illness—or at least lessen it—with tailored vaccines, which use a tiny bit of those antigens to prepare the body to make antibodies before the disease has a chance to enter our systems. For a deadly disease—or one that is more threatening to higher-risk individuals, such as people with compromised immune systems or chronic illnesses or who are very young or very old—avoiding the initial infection can mean avoiding a severe outcome, or even death.mRNA vaccines are especially crucial because they can be adjusted quickly to target an emerging viral foe. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . How mRNA vaccines are differentLong before COVID arrived, scientists were hard at work searching for ways to get our bodies to prepare for diseases without actually exposing people to a disease’s antigens at all. Enter mRNA vaccines, which have been in development since the 1980s, tested in mice since the 1990s, and trialed in humans since the 2010s. So promising was this work—especially in its potential to save lives in the face of a future pandemic—that in the 2010s it even received funding from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).DNA can’t directly build proteins—it needs a translator. This is where mRNA comes in—single-stranded RNA uses DNA as a template to copy and then carry a specific chunk of information out of a cell’s nucleus and into the cytoplasm, where that information can be put to work making proteins. mRNA acts specifically as a messenger to ferry that information.An mRNA vaccine is able to skip the step of injecting antigens into the body. Instead it provides those bits of genetic code that instruct our cells to create proteins similar to those found in some viruses. Once our cells make those proteins, the body can use them as training tools to create antibodies specifically geared to fight back when faced with that virus. Because they can be tailored to a specific illness so quickly, they are the best line of defense we currently have against future viral pandemics. And they are also being studied to help counter numerous common infectious diseases, from malaria to HIV, and may even be helpful for genetic diseases like sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis.

Ripples from research funding cutsUnlike changing the schedule of recommended vaccines, canceling funding for future vaccine research may not be felt—in terms of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths that could have been avoided—for years to come. But public health experts have already spoken out against the new funding cuts. “This decision will have severe consequences, measured in lost lives, when a rapid vaccine response is needed,” Rick Bright, a former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, told STAT News. And in addition to traditional pandemic candidates, such as another SARS virus or influenza, the emergence and spread of novel viruses is becoming an increasing threat due to a changing climate.“Our public health is dependent on taking collective action. Vaccines remain one of the most powerful collective health tools we have,” National Nurses United, the largest union and professional association of registered nurses in the U.S., wrote in a statement this week. “Cancelling investment in the most promising vaccine technology we have is a deadly mistake.” Lead image: KwangSoo Kim / Shutterstock ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

      "content": "This is the new memoir from the poet Sally Read. I enjoy Read's poetry and was very pleased to read this. Here is a good religious poem. And here is a collection based on her time as a psychiatric nurse.The Mary Pages tells the story of Read's obsession with the Virgin, from her atheistic childhood to her conversion she has always looked intently at the various depictions of Mary and thought about them as reference points for cultural, spiritual, and political matters. As well as being a good memoir, The Mary Pages is full of art interpretation, religious thinking, discussions of relationships, motherhood, marriage, and so on, but in an entirely different way to the norm. There are other naked Madonnas: Edvard Munch painted the Virgin exposed in sexual ecstasy with a red halo. But he, like all the others, misunderstood the sublimity of her form. I see indifference in the eyes of Munch's Madonna, and contempt. The quiddity of true love and ecstasy (the perfect blend of eros into agape) is clear and arrow-like; it only illuminates. When the substance of pure love is interpreted by the disillusioned, the sad, the hungry, the angry (i.e., most of us), it warps into power games, shame, and hurt. She is powerful, the feminists might say of Munch's Madonna. I say, better to keep her clothes on.The fact is that no one is ready to see Mary dance naked at the dawn of time. For us, dancing and nakedness segue quickly into the erotic, and the doors open to the stampeding dopamine hits, the snowballing fantasies of concupiscence and pornography. Which means that we are incapable of thinking of the Virgin dancing; we are incapable of thinking of her naked. We are stooped and narrow-sighted as Adam and Eve lurching out of the Garden.And this.By now, I was used to the ordinary theater of the Church (not the sacrifice of the Mass, which was the epitome of lucent understatement, as though the atom were split at the altar each day and we simply crossed ourselves and bowed our heads). I mean the theater of the tiny skull of St. Agnes in Rome, which we took our visitors to see. I mean the black tongue of St. Anthony in Padua. Or the incorrupt body of a blessed nun that lay in a glass coffin in a chapel near our house. I mean the one silver hair belonging to the head of Pope St. John Paul II that was twisted artfully around silver pins to form a flower and given to a friend. The night I was received into the Church, I was passed that saint's rosary by his housekeeper and held it in my hands. I played with a fragment of St. Bernadette's habit and a clump of soil from the grave of St. Rafqa. Even Mary's veil is supposedly preserved in a church in France. I had looked at its image and wondered if it had really touched her head, if her eyes had studied with pleasure its pale weave of stripes.\"It's a death cult,\" my New Yorker friend Maisie said of the Church, and I agreed that attachment to bodies, and things of the dead, was strange. But as a young woman, had I not gasped at the drafts of Sylvia Plath's poems in the British Library, the red-inked flower she doodled under a poem? I thought I could see her movement, her life, in each stroke—like the dried pulse of spilled blood on La Madonnina's plaster cheek. (And when I walked into a hospital office a year after splitting with Mischa and saw a note in his handwriting on a file, didn't I jump violently as if it were a coiled snake?)Here is a passage from a section where Read discusses Mary's devotion to her son. The Mary Pages is probably not the book many people want to read about motherhood, but I found it interesting, forthright, honest, and well-expressed.\"My soul magnifies the Lord,\" Mary sang at the accomplishment of what she was made to be. It's clear to me now that in her whole and jubilant womanhood, she would never want to be separated from him. And for those who say Mary is sexless, I say: think of to whom she gives her sexuality and of what else she gives him (her everything); think of how she yielded in her extraordinary conception, of how she loves. In her, there is no division, no rupture, no forgetting of what she is, no self-hatred. There is no falsity, no playacting, no confusion, no withholding from her Maker. She is as responsive as the sea to light and cloud, as generous as air that endlessly expands, as ecstatic as a bride and as faithful. I believe she loves her naked body and is at ease with her breasts and her rounded belly, because he does, and because he is.Of course she knelt before him.For what mother, I ask de Beauvoir twenty years after that blizzard, does not kneel before her baby? What mother has not knelt before the crib and felt something like the wordless and surging adoration of prayer? A mother's love for her baby is overwhelming. It crescendos in waves. It comes like labor pains: just as she thinks that she can take no more, the intensity disperses, leaving her gasping. God knows that we can't hold the entirety of love (or pain) in one go. It would tear us to pieces. But mothers have a privileged glimpse of this infinite love that binds us so thoroughly to our children. When we kneel before our child, we are bowing at a glimpse of divine love that effortlessly holds everything.Recommended.",

      "content": "A decade ago, the French economist Thomas Piketty published “Capital In The 21st Century,” a blockbuster screed against the rich getting richer. In that weighty tome, he encapsulated the dynamic of steadily increasing inequality with the formula r > g: the compounded rate of return on capital is greater than the rate of economic growth. In short, the inequality gap inexorably grows over time between those who own capital assets that appreciate in value, especially financial assets, and those who work and live paycheck to paycheck.In a recent University of Chicago Journal of Political Economy study, Moritz Kuhn, Moritz Schularick and Ulrike I. Steins traced the growth of wealth inequality in America from 1949 to 2016. They pointed out the central importance of portfolio composition in creating the wealth gap. While working families have little savings for investment, middle-class portfolios are dominated by housing, while rich households mostly own business equity.Former World Bank economist Branko Milanović notes that this concentration of ownership of financial assets has accelerated in most countries since the 1990s, where “a rising share of total income is going to capital. That means total income will become more and more concentrated. With the extremely uneven distribution of financial assets, the wealth of a country is going more and more to only the people at the top and very little percolates downward.”To boot, a New York Federal Reserve Bank study shows how the concentration of wealth reproduces itself because more time, effort and expertise are put into managing holdings as they grow larger. “Concentration in capital ownership causes a transition to an unequal steady state,” the study concludes. In 2024, the richest 10% owned 93% of all equity in the U.S.As frequently noted in Noema, this condition will be exacerbated by the innovations of digital capitalism that are increasingly divorcing employment and income from productivity growth and wealth creation, generating an ever-accelerating gap between those who “own the robots” and those who labor for their livelihood.Policies that respond to this challenge would foster an ownership share for all in the wealth generated by intelligent machines that are diminishing or displacing gainful employment. The aim is to enhance the assets of the less well off in the first place — pre-distribution — instead of only redistributing the income of others after the fact.In our 2019 book “Renovating Democracy: Governing In The Age of Globalization and Digital Capitalism,” Nicolas Berggruen and I called this concept “universal basic capital,” or UBC. The idea is not just to break up the concentration of wealth at the top, but to build it from below. The best way to fight inequality in the digital age, we wrote, is to spread the equity around.Enter MAGA AccountsWho could have expected that it would be a MAGA-dominated U.S. Congress that is blazing an incipient path to universal basic capital in the world’s largest economy as one key way to counter the dynamic of inequality Piketty identified?The Money Account for Growth and Advancement program was passed into law last month as part of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” While in most respects that budget package benefits the rich, the so-called MAGA accounts aim to bolster the assets of the rest so that just like the rich, they too can own capital that will grow in compounding value from invested savings.Starting as early as July 2026, every child under 8 who is an American citizen will be auto-enrolled into an account with a $1,000 deposit from the government. All income from investments for that account held throughout its term — when the child turns 18 — would be tax-deferred, after which withdrawals would be taxed at the low long-term capital gains rate. Families can add up to $5,000 per year to the account.Distributions are only allowed once the child is 18, at which point account holders are allowed access to only 50% of their funds, and solely for higher education, training programs, small business loans and first-time home purchases. At age 25, savings account holders are allowed to withdraw up to the full balance of the account, but only for those same specified purposes. Upon reaching 30, account holders can access the full balance for any purpose desired. \"Who could have expected that it would be a MAGA-dominated U.S. Congress that is blazing an incipient path to universal basic capital?\" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who championed the program, said of the accounts: “There are many Americans who don’t own stocks or bonds, are not invested in the market, and may not feel particularly invested in the American free enterprise system. This will give everyone a stake.”Various similar “baby bond” schemes have been underway elsewhere, from California to Connecticut to France and the United Kingdom, mostly geared toward low earners.The most successful was the U.K. Child Trust Fund. It was launched in 2003 by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown. In the austerity years of Prime Minister David Cameron following the financial crisis of 2008, the trust was wound down in 2011. In terms of encouraging savings, however, it was a clear success. During its lifetime, 6.3 million new savings accounts were opened. As of April 2023, the total market value of the accounts was 9 billion pounds ($11.4 billion), of which the government contributed only 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion).The Big WorryWhat is most worrisome about the otherwise worthy MAGA accounts is that some among the ideological right in the U.S. will see it as one day replacing Social Security.Indeed, last week U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent actually said of the MAGA program, “In a way, it is a back door for privatizing Social Security. Social Security is a defined benefit plan paid out. To the extent that, if all of a sudden these accounts grow, and you have in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for your retirement, then that’s a game changer.”Realizing the implications of his musings, Bessent hastened to clarify what he meant on X. What he called “Trump Baby Accounts” are “an additive benefit for future generations, which will supplement the sanctity of Social Security’s guaranteed payments. This is not an either-or question: our Administration is committed to protecting Social Security and to making sure seniors have more money.” Let’s hope that is a sincere pledge and not subject to changing on a whim as so much else in Washington these days.Paying The PiperOver the longer term, the question is how such a massive budget commitment can be sustained when U.S. public debt is already 120% of the GDP, or whether it will go the way of the otherwise successful UK Child Trust.One idea floating around is to make the initial $1,000 deposit a loan, instead of a grant, that would be paid back when the account comes to term without interest. As the MAGA account program matures, this would create a kind of revolving fund to keep it going.Another notion being floated would use the considerable revenues expected from tariffs to fund the program in a kind of virtuous cycle where the home market for investment opportunities is boosted while generating returns for a broader class of citizens. Even accounting for any slowdown as a result of protectionist measures, the Yale Budget Lab projects $2.2 trillion in government revenue at current tariff rates from 2025-2036.Whether implemented through MAGA accounts or otherwise, UBC ought to be embraced as a bipartisan agenda. After all, its American patriotic pedigree goes back to Thomas Paine, who proposed in 1797 that every newborn child should be provided with an equal endowment financed by an inheritance tax on wealthy landowners.As left-leaning Nobel economist Joe Stiglitz and top hedge fund manager Ray Dalio agreed in a Noema exchange, UBC is “neither capitalist nor socialist,” but a practical way to more fairly share the wealth that transcends stale old ideological divides.

      "content": "I've written many articles over the years about how mass transit projects in the United States go awry — from overbuilt stations to misguided priorities, too much focus on projects with little transportation value, outdated operational paradigms, and a reluctance to just say no, all of which show that there is a lot we're getting wrong in this country about transit. But most of these are ideas for how transit agencies could make better decisions. A step-back question that policymakers who've read these takes often have is: what could be different, policy-wise, at the federal level that would generate better outcomes? What rules are making it hard for good ideas to be implemented or creating bad incentives? How could Congress and/or the Department of Transportation change things to make this all work better? The Institute for Progress, one of my favorite think tanks, wants to help policymakers answer those questions, and they want your help in coming up with the answers. They want to develop a Transit Policy Playbook (modeled on the Techno-Industrial Policy Playbook they already published) full of memos providing specific, actionable policy ideas that can be implemented by congressional or executive branch action. What they want from you or someone you know is a very brief submission — a problem statement and a description of your proposed solution, with each component coming in at less than 400 words. If they pick your idea, you'll get $2,000 and they'll work with you to flesh it out into a 2,000-word memo. This is a great opportunity for people with deep knowledge of the transit space to work with people who have deep knowledge of the policymaking process to transform a compelling abstract concept into something that elected officials and political appointees can actually put into practice. The deadline for submissions is August 24th and the application link is here. As a related project, IFP has a bunch of transit-related episodes of their Statecraft podcast lately, including an interview with Slow Boring fave Alon Levy, a conversation with WMATA General Manager Randy Clarke on how DC Metro was stabilized and turned around, and a fascinating episode with Stephanie Pollack about the near-death and ultimate salvation of the Green Line Extension project in Boston. But again, the hope here is to move beyond case studies to big policy ideas that will drive change nationally. Slow Boring is a reader-supported publication.

This one practically wrote itself: DOE is making big nuclear moves, OpenAI and Google dropped new models, ElevenLabs is taking their tech to music, and researchers may have found a simple Alzheimer's therapeutic. The Optimism Gods lobbed me a softball this week. Hopefully we knocked it out of the park.Let's get to it.Today's Weekly Dose is brought to you by... Stripe StartupsEvery venture-backed company — you, yes, you — should work with Stripe Startups.Stripe's mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and it's working. Last year, 1.3% of global GDP flowed through Stripe, over $1.4 trillion and growing. 78% of the Forbes AI 50 use Stripe's financial infrastructure to monetize faster, experiment with pricing, and grow revenue.Startups need to monetize faster, experiment with pricing, and grow revenue, too, so that they can become big companies faster and grow the GDP of the internet. That's why Stripe launched Stripe Startups.Stripe Startups is the company's new program designed to support early-stage, venture-backed businesses as they build, iterate, and scale. Founders enrolled in Stripe Startups get access to credits to offset Stripe fees, expert insights, and a focused community of other founders building on Stripe.You're going to use Stripe anyway.

The DOE selected Standard Nuclear, a Not Boring Capital portfolio company, to lead the first pilot project under its new nuclear fuel line program. The initiative, backed by a 2025 Trump EO, will reduce reliance on foreign enriched uranium and support the deployment of high-efficiency reactors by mid-2026. Standard Nuclear will develop fabrication facilities in Tennessee and Idaho to produce TRISO fuel, while sourcing uranium through the DOE's HALEU program.TRISO fuel is made of uranium particles individually coated with multiple layers of carbon and ceramic, creating a robust, heat- and radiation-resistant structure. It's designed to be inherently safer than conventional fuel, capable of withstanding extreme conditions without melting or releasing radioactive material. Basically, nuclear was already extremely safe and TRISO fuel reduces the risk even more.This announcement is big for Standard Nuclear (obviously) as it's a really strong signal that it can effectively work with the federal government and that its approach is feasible. But it's also big news for America. The tide has been shifting on nuclear for a few years now, but now we're also seeing real, government action being taken and private companies win business by supporting those actions. And speaking of enriched uranium... This week, General Matter signed a lease with the DOE to establish the nation's first U.S.-owned, privately developed uranium enrichment facility at the former Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, where they plan to enrich uranium by the end of the decade.Renderings of General Matter uranium enrichment facility in Paducah, KYEnrichment is upstream of TRISO fabrication. Pull the uranium from the ground, enrich it to various (sub-weapons-grade) levels depending on the type of reactor it's going to feed, and if it's an advanced reactor, pack it into tiny, inherently safe TRISO pellets for use anywhere from data centers to remote communities to utilities to the moon. These are big steps in re-establishing a nuclear fuel supply chain in America, which we once had but, like so many other now-critical industries, gave up. Before Standard Nuclear, there was no independent TRISO fabrication company (i.e. without its own reactor) in the US, and before General Matter, there was no uranium enrichment company in the US. We import most of our enriched uranium from Russia, even while sanctioning them in other areas. For a history of how we let this happen, and what it's going to take to bring it back, we highly recommend Mike Solana's piece on General Matter for Pirate Wires, American Power.(2) GPT-5 is HereOur smartest, fastest, and most useful model yet, with thinking built in. Available to everyone.From OpenAIOpenAI released GPT-5 yesterday, and while the reviews from those who had early access were fairly breathless, the general sentiment seems to be that OpenAI made a bunch of product improvements and very little in the way of progress towards a digital god that replaces the need for humans altogether. That's great news! It's exactly what we should be rooting for: better tools for humans. Goldilocks zone, baby!I'm no AI expert (I only play one on LinkedIn), but this feels like the shape of AI launches for a while: marginally faster, smarter, prettier, easier, and cheaper. GPT-3.5 was the once-in-a-decade magic moment: it paired a model with a UX in ChatGPT that turned AI into a mass-market phenomenon. GPT-4o spread that magic across the multimodal features consumers now expect. GPT-5 mostly made those capabilities better: more reliable, more performant, more consistent. The magic is being refined into something you can actually depend on. And that's OK.Something, something, Louis CK airplane wifi bit something, something. The magic is that airplane wifi even existed, even if it was unreliable, slow, and glitchy. Now it's faster, more stable, and in some cases, thanks to companies like SpaceX, you can stream video, make calls, or work in real time from a private jet over the middle of nowhere.Magic, improved incrementally over time, compounds into real-world, life-changing utility. And maybe, just maybe, one of these iterations will bring another leap whether that's GPT-6, GPT-7, or something we haven't even named yet.(3) Genie 3: A new frontier for world modelsFrom Google DeepmindToday we are announcing Genie 3, a general purpose world model that can generate an unprecedented diversity of interactive environments. Given a text prompt, Genie 3 can generate dynamic worlds that you can navigate in real time at 24 frames per second, retaining consistency for a few minutes at a resolution of 720p.Not to be outdone, Google DeepMind dropped what might be the most \"magic\" AI release of the week: Genie 3. It's what they call a \"world model,\" an AI that can simulate entire environments, including physics, visuals, and how those worlds respond to your actions. Feed it a text prompt, and Genie 3 generates a fully interactive world you can explore in real time at 24 frames per second, with surprisingly strong consistency that lasts for minutes. I haven't had a chance to play around with it yet, but the demo videos are extremely impressive and I am looking forward to exploring it myself this weekend. Unlike traditional 3D engines, Genie 3 doesn't use prebuilt assets. It generates each frame on the fly, adapting dynamically as you move or interact. You can also change the world mid-experience by prompting events like storms or new objects. The results range from photorealistic coastal walks and deep-sea dives to surreal fantasy scenes and animated characters. I am not sure how immediately valuable this is for gaming studios or Hollywood or even hobbyists, but the ability to dynamically and realistically generate and change the virtual world around you seems like a key building block for next-gen gaming, metaverse, and whatever comes after AGI.Long-time readers of the Dose will know that we have been long-time \"Google DeepMind is way more impressive than it gets credit for\" truthers. After its upgrades and OpenAI's somewhat underwhelming GPT-5 release, predictors on Polymarket now assign an 85% chance to Google having the best AI model at the end of August. What a TRANSFORMation. Polymarket(4) Eleven Music is HereFrom ElevenLabsWith Eleven Music, businesses, creators, artists, and every single one of our users can generate studio-grade music from natural language prompts.Let the music drop.ElevenLabs, the company behind some of the most realistic text-to-speech and voice-cloning tools on the market, just launched Eleven Music. Eleven Music lets users create studio-quality songs from natural language prompts, with full control over genre, structure, and instrumentation. Users can generate everything from instrumental scores to vocal tracks in multiple languages, then fine-tune lyrics or individual sections with precision editing tools. It was trained on a dataset of studio-recorded music, vocals, and lyrics, and was developed in collaboration with artists, publishers, and music producers. AI music isn't a new concept, but Eleven's take stands out for how polished and flexible the output is and, importantly, for the fact that it's cleared for nearly all commercial use cases, from advertising to film to social content to just cooking up bangers. Public access is now available. Excited to jam out to some chart-topping Eleven Music soon.(5) Lithium deficiency and the onset of Alzheimer's diseaseAron et al in NatureReplacement therapy with lithium orotate, which is a Li salt with reduced amyloid binding, prevents pathological changes and memory loss in AD mouse models and ageing wild-type mice. These findings reveal physiological effects of endogenous Li in the brain and indicate that disruption of Li homeostasis may be an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. Li replacement with amyloid-evading salts is a potential approach to the prevention and treatment of AD.We cover Alzheimer's more than just about any other area of medical research. Partly because it runs in the family...so yes, we're hoping science beats the clock. But also because Alzheimer's research is some of the most dynamic and high-stakes out there. It's got everything: big breakthroughs, public failures, weird theories, and some of the best clues we have into how the brain actually works. So when something big drops, we pay attention.This week something big dropped: researchers discovered that lithium levels in the brain, not the bloodstream, drop early in people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's. It's not just a symptom, either. Lithium gets pulled into amyloid plaques, the hallmark gunk of Alzheimer's, which keeps it from doing its job. When researchers fed mice a lithium-deficient diet, things got worse fast: more plaques, more tangled proteins, more inflammation, and faster cognitive decline.Then they flipped the script. The team gave mice lithium orotate, a low-dose, brain-accessible form that avoids plaque traps, and saw major improvements. Less plaque, fewer tangles, preserved synapses and memory. Even healthy aging mice benefited. Lithium deficiency also triggered gene activity eerily similar to what's seen in human Alzheimer's brains. The takeaway: lithium might play a much more important role in brain aging than anyone realized, and very low, targeted doses could become part of future prevention or treatment.Now if only there were a gummy entrepreneur out there that could put this lithium orotate into a gummy...Have a great weekend y'all.Thanks to Stripe Startups for sponsoring. Love these guys, we don't say that enough.We'll be back in your inbox next week.Thanks for reading,Packy + Dan",

I'll be posting about one of these a week for several months. When you've read them all, I'll ask you to vote for a favorite, so remember which ones you liked]My dad only actually enjoys about ten foods, nine of them beige. His bread? White. His pizza? Cheese. His meat? Turkey breast. And his side dish? Mashed potatoes.As a child I hated mashed potatoes, despite his evangelization of them. I too was a picky eater growing up, but I would occasionally attempt to see what he saw in his beloved spuds. Whenever I tried a bite, the texture disgusted me: a gritty gruel of salty flakes coated with the oleic pall of margarine. The flavor reminded me of stale Pringles. I checked back once every couple years, but was repulsed by them every time.I lobbied my parents for pasta or frozen tater tots or any other side I actually liked. Family dinners were often dichotomous, the same protein supplemented by two different carbs. \"You are not my son,\" my father would joke as he continued to put away his potato slop. \"Maybe you're not my father,\" I'd shoot back when he shunned the rest of the family's rice pilaf. Our starch preferences seemed irreconcilable.As I entered my teen years, my palate expanded. After I'd tried and enjoyed brussels sprouts and sushi and escargot, my hatred of one of the most basic and inoffensive of all foods seemed silly. One day at a nice restaurant, I decided to give mashed potatoes one more try.Upon taking my first bite, I realized three things:1) Mashed potatoes are good.2) Whatever my dad had been eating at home was not mashed potatoes.3) My world is built on lies.Mashed Potatoes are GoodPotatoes were domesticated several millennia ago at the dawn of agriculture in the rugged highlands near Lake Titicaca in modern-day Peru. Their origins lie in a wild family of tiny, bitter, pockmarked solanum roots, so full of glycoalkaloids that when foraged they had to be eaten alongside clay to soak up their toxins. From this paltry stock of nightshades, archaic peoples of the Andes gradually husbanded generous, nutritious, mild tubers that would remain the staple of the region's foodways through several successive civilizations.These roots resemble the ancestral stock of modern potatoes (source)Andean peoples found all sorts of ways to prepare their potatoes. The most immediate method was to boil them into stews, soups, or mashes with local flavoring agents - herbs, salt, chilis. Earthenware ovens called huatias were used to bake them. With even more time, they could be fermented into tocosh, an edible paste with antibacterial properties.To get the spuds to really last, though, they were subjected to a natural freeze-drying method that produced shrivelled potato pellets called chuño. Repeatedly frozen by bitter mountain nights, baked in the sun, and stomped on to remove water, chuño remains shelf stable for up to a decade and can be rehydrated into a spongy, earthy, slightly less nutritious potato-like object.The ability to produce chuño on the Altiplano is thought to have contributed to the Incan empire's military dominance of the region, since despite its generally unappealing gustatory properties it's perfect for keeping troops fed on long marches. Chuño also allowed Incan civilization to stockpile surpluses against lean years and trade potatoes as commodities over great distances. It wasn't the best way to eat a potato you harvested today, but it was the only way to turn a potato you have today into a potato you'll have two years from now. That had immense value.After the Spanish conquest and the Columbian exchange, the potato made gradual inroads into the Old World, where the previous best root vegetables were often comparatively less nutritious parsnips and turnips. There was an initial adjustment period: new cultivars capable of growing in shorter hours of daylight had to be developed, objections to the absence of tubers in the Bible needed to be quelled, and the French eventually had to concede that potatoes do not, as they at first believed, cause leprosy.With these hurdles cleared, in the 19th century the potato spread out and became one of the easiest and most efficient ways to turn arable land into palatable calories the world over. National cuisines incorporated the new staple crop thoroughly, and it's now hard to imagine Italian food without gnocchi, French sans vichyssoise, tapas without patatas bravas, a Eurasia bereft of aloo and rösti and colcannon and latkes.Europe's new potato lovers also took to the simple recipe of boiling 'em and mashing 'em. While South America had lacked the livestock for dairy, in Europe the potato mash soon achieved its ultimate form with the addition of milk and butter, which impart a smoother texture and richer taste. Hannah Glasse's procedure published in 1747 in The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy is, minus the long s's, still just about how I make them today:Maſhed Potatoes.BOIL your potatoes, peel them and put them into a ſauce-pan, maſh them well ; To two pounds of potatoes, put a pint of milk, a little ſalt, ſtir them well together, take care they don't ſtick to the bottom, then take a quarter of a pound of butter, ſtir in and ſerve it up.Nowhere was the potato embraced more thoroughly than in Ireland. In the early 19th century, extractive British demands on Irish agriculture to feed the armies fighting Napoleon reduced the available land for Irish farmers to feed themselves. Achieving maximum caloric density on the remaining land was paramount, and almost nothing is denser than the potato.Potatoes quickly became an integral part of Irish life, so essential to the food systems of the island that when a blight hit them in the mid-1840s it led to one of the most devastating famines in history. The failure of the potato crops created starvation and emigration so profound in scale that the population of the island still has not recovered to its 1845 level almost two centuries later.Among those millions of potato-starved emigres were my dad's ancestors, who came to America in the decades following the famine. My great-grandfather, who bore the extremely Irish name Gerald FitzGerald, instilled in his children (including my grandmother) a reconstructed sense of Irish-American ethnic pride that included an affinity for corned beef and cabbage, Guinness beer, and the affordable practicality of mashed potatoes.As the generations marched on, those mashed potatoes turned out to be one of the only things my grandmother would make that my exceedingly picky father would eat. Their creamy texture and subtle starchy taste didn't trigger the \"ew gross\" reaction he had to so many other foods. Mashed potatoes, just like the ones Glasse had written about more than two centuries earlier, became his favorite side - and eventually, when I finally got to try them, one of mine too.Whatever My Dad Had Been Eating at Home Was NOT Mashed PotatoesThe chuño-chomping Incans were not the last military to rely on dehydrated potatoes for sustenance. In World War II, the US Army experimented with various forms of potato dehydration to help stretch supply lines. The easiest way to get a uniform potato commodity into the hands of G.I.s was to pulverize the potatoes into granules, dehydrate them, and then plan on bringing them back to life with boiling water in an imitation of \"mashed potatoes\".These shreds resemble the ancestral stock of modern Instant Mashed Potatoes (source)The result was an affront. The potatoes were swimming in their own gluten, released during the granule-making process, which when mixed with imprecise water ratios made for a slop that was somehow both gluey and soupy. Immediately after the war, French's (now best known for mustard) tried to introduce \"instant mashed potatoes\" as a consumer product category. America's veterans were not having it. They didn't want to be reminded of the awful slurry they'd had on the front.The commercial fortunes of instant mashed potatoes began to turn around a decade later, however, when food scientists in the US and Canada converged on methods for producing dehydrated potato flakes rather than granules. The flakes had substantial advantages. They didn't get as glutinous when reconstituted. Their geometry made them easier to dry quickly, on the order of minutes or even seconds. Using a multi-step process called the \"Philadelphia Cook\", they could lock in a more natural flavor. When prepared on the stove with butter and milk, they were supposed to turn out almost as good as the real thing without any onerous prep work on the part of the consumer.This raises the question, though, of why food scientists kept working on improving instant mashed potatoes a decade after they were no longer required for the war effort. If you're no longer constrained by having to stick it to the Axis, why not return to Glasse-style maſhed potatoes in all circumstances?This is a pattern that recurs frequently in reading about American foodways of the 20th century: choices and innovations made under extreme duress in the World War II economy didn't fade away when the duress subsided. Instead they echoed back into American life a few years later, despite the lean conditions that birthed them being replaced by extreme abundance.Why did America start eating like it was on a total war footing again when my parents' generation was young? There are a lot of overlapping explanations. Here are a few:Industrial inertia: Companies that had spun up to supply a vast army didn't want to shut down overnight, so they necessarily pivoted to the consumer market. Some of these efforts succeeded at entrenching new consumer categories (fish sticks, canned peaches) while others (hamburgers-in-a-can) did not.Genuine innovation: Technologies brought to maturity during and after the war, notably frozen food, offer novel consumer benefits that stand on their own merits.Tastes fixed by rationing: Consumer habits are sticky. People who spent a couple years forced to buy margarine instead of rationed butter, or skim milk instead of rationed meat, got used to those items and wanted to continue buying them in greater quantities than the prewar status quo.Pursuit of efficiency: As women entered the workforce en masse in the postwar era, the pool of hours available to be spent on domestic labor like cooking shrank. As much as any dishwasher or washing machine, convenience foods are labor-saving, productivity-enhancing technologies for the home.This last factor is the only one that can explain the continued development of instant mashed potato technology. There were no potato-flaking interests during the war to have inertia; the instant mashed potatoes are not superior to their fresh antecedents; there was no ingrained consumer preference for an instant mashed potato product. It is only the desire to reduce time spent on food prep that could create \"better instant mashed potatoes\" as a commercially viable R&D space in the 1950s.The other factors contributed to the unique awfulness of my father's instant mashed potatoes, though.Another WWII technological innovation, the cavity magnetron used in radar installations, led directly to the invention of the home microwave oven which began to proliferate widely in the 1970s. The microwave supercharged all \"convenience food\" trends, shortening not just prep time but cooking time as well. Uneven heating is hardly a concern when you can speed up your meals by a factor of ten.Meanwhile, the existing postwar status of margarine and skim milk was greatly enhanced by the dietary fat scare of the 1980s and 1990s. These products displaced butter and whole milk as health-conscious consumers sought to eliminate saturated fats from their diets in a doomed effort to stave off the incipient obesity epidemic.My parents, both already primed to accept these imitative products by my grandparents' wartime preference formation, exclusively purchased margarine and skim milk for the household once they got married. And, pressed for time with two jobs and two kids, they frequently purchased instant mashed potatoes as well. And cooked them in the microwave.What resulted was a second-order simulation of true maſhed potatoes, perverted and made unreal by the consumer echoes of the second world war. Real potatoes were substituted with desiccated flakes, real milk with a thin byproduct, real butter with refined vegetable oil, real mashing with the Philadelphia Cook, a real stovetop flame with microwave excitation. The measuring cup contained a substance gesturing at the notion of \"mashed potatoes\", but no aspect of the original remained.Yet because the name was the same, my father still believed he was eating the same dish my grandma made, the same dish his ancestors ate in Ireland, the same dish Glasse wrote about a quarter millennium ago. The appeal to him was undiminished. His body ate the slurry, but his mind still ate the maſhed potatoes of his youth.My World is Built on LiesIn researching whether the ancient Andean peoples really did boil and mash potatoes, I came across this post which sheds light on the issues I have with my father's instant mashed potatoes beyond their phenomenal unpleasantness when eaten.There is a rhetorical sleight of hand happening in this Reddit post title.1 The phrasing implies that chuño resembles modern instant mashed potatoes in some way, that instant mashed potatoes are in some sense continuous with indigenous ways of potato-knowing. But there is no continuity of process, because the way chuño is created has no particular commonalities with the Philadelphia Cook beyond the removal of moisture. There is no continuity of form, for chuño actually looks like this:(source)And there is no continuity of purpose, either. To the Andean peoples, chuño was the only way of ensuring that their potato crops would be available well into the future. In America, our indigenous way of achieving this potato security is the entire miracle of modern agriculture and food distribution. I don't need to stomp on freeze-dried potatoes in the Altiplano to make sure I'll have access to potato nutrients next year. I just have to rely on the continued existence of Idaho and Target. No, despite what this redditor would like to believe, the instant mashed potato serves some other purpose.That purpose is illuminated by the second rhetorical sleight of hand in the Reddit post, the one occurring on the box, in the form of the offset between the yellow lower-case \"Instant\" and the white majuscule \"MASHED POTATOES\". \"These are fundamentally maſhed potatoes,\" this typography lies, \"that happen to have been given the quality of 'instant'\".But they're not. They're a different thing entirely, a completely new evolutionary lineage of potato preparation that's called \"instant mashed potatoes\" even though they've never been mashed. They are as distinct from Glasse's maſhed potatoes as chuño is, but they masquerade as being the same, because that is their purpose - the fulfillment of a psychological need to consume something resembling the classic dish of \"mashed potatoes\" with slightly less effort than that dish requires.This is a pedantic distinction - but it's a distinction that had a big impact on my culinary life, because I believed the lie. My mental category of \"mashed potatoes\" was hijacked by this impostor and it made me think, for years and years, that I hated something that I actually would have liked all along. My preference formation was distorted by this warped, hyper-optimized fulfillment of my father's crystallized preference. The expedient way to fulfill one generation's desire locked the next generation out of experiencing that desire at all.At this point in the review you might say, \"what's the big deal? It's just mashed potatoes. Chill out.\" Which, fair enough - if it were just mashed potatoes then 2500 words on them might be excessive. But the pattern I've described is far from unique to pureed tubers.Consider an abstracted version of the saga of my father's instant mashed potatoes. It has a few steps:Humanity develops a Thing from ingredients that exist in the world.Seeking efficiency at scale, an industry chops the ingredients of the Thing into teeny tiny bits.Using an artificial emulsifier, the bits are bound back together into an aesthetically deficient but more convenient slurry that resembles the Thing.Because it contains traces of the ingredients of the original Thing, this IMPish admixture is sold to us as if it were the original Thing.Pared back to this level of abstraction, a surprising amount of stuff starts to seem like my father's instant mashed potatoes.The other foods in this category are obvious - McNuggets reconstituted out of pink slime, American cheese product, instant coffee, deli ham, Pringles minted from the very same potato flakes that go into IMPs. We've even developed a whole new health scare over them: \"Ultra processed foods\"2 are as demonized now as butter and whole milk were when my parents were young.Expand the pattern to the built environment. Pressboard, particle board, and other reconstituted material composites likely make up a majority of new furniture sold in the US. These are an IMPish imitation of actual wood furniture. Take care while assembling not to ding your brittle sheetrock walls, an IMPish upgrade over lath and plaster. Often these interiors live inside an apartment building clad in a mish-mash of random ornament, anti-massing regulations demanding an IMPish simulation of a varied city block.Intellectual goods can be IMPish. Reader's Digest, sports \"best-of\" VHSes, textbooks stuffed with decontextualized excerpts, YouTube compilations, ChiveTV, listicles, social media feeds consisting of screenshots of other social media, Now That's What I Call Music!, an entire ecosystem of actual cultural objects broken down into bits and clumped back together.Corporate structures can be IMPish. When I visit a medical office it's usually a confusing tangle of overlapping practitioners and practices operating out of the same physical address, an IMPish imitation of the archetypal doctor with a shingle in town. Similar quagmires abound when dealing with insurance, or contractors, or financial services.Once you see the instant mashed potato antipattern it's hard to stop. The isomorphisms are everywhere.The gig economy makes IMPish jobs. Swiping apps produce IMPish flirting. Meta-studies are IMPish science. Ted Talks are IMPish symposia. Malls are IMPish shopping districts. Subdivisions are IMPish neighborhoods. Cruises are IMPish international travel, chopped into 14 hour chunks and emulsified with an ocean liner.The internet scrapes together IMPish communities. We're not atomized; we're flaked. We're Philadelphia Cooked, and we're stewing here together in the microwave.Large Language Models can gall on an aesthetic level because they are IMPish slurries of thought itself, every word ever written dried into weights and vectors and lubricated with the margarine of RLHF.3 Since World War II and the large-scale industrialization it fully unleashed, a core method driving 'progress' across many different fields of human endeavor has been to shred something real and reconstitute it into a faster, easier, less appealing IMPish substitute for what we used to make out of it. This is the parsimonious recipe for industry to fulfill our urges. We've got the food processor whirring, and absolutely everything is going in.Why must the real be shredded to achieve these simulacra? Why can substitute products not be synthesized out of whole cloth? Because the integration of shreds of the real provides psychic camouflage, a credible way for the IMPish mimics to signal as their models:The problem with this, of course, is the problem I had with my father's instant mashed potatoes: the substitute is only able to satisfy a craving if you have the craving in the first place, and that requires direct experience with that which it is meant to replace. The memory of the thing being mimicked is a necessary ingredient for the IMPish imitation to work, the mental spell that allows the transmutation from IMPish Thing to Thing (original).If you get to the party too late, if you never get to taste the maſhed potatoes, all you're left with is a confusingly disappointing slurry going by the same name. When no distinction is drawn between the IMPish thing and its original, you don't know what you're missing. You don't even know there's anything to miss - after all, you're still eating \"mashed potatoes\"!If the IMPishness is pervasive enough, eventually you start to disbelieve that any of these reconstituted things could ever have been worthwhile, that any of the desires and preferences being fulfilled by these slurries ever could have been authentic. \"Is this really what life is?\", you wonder, never having lived. \"I don't see why everyone was so jazzed about it.\"Cultivars of the RealWhile formulating this review, I encountered a troubling congruence: the period during which my dad has been eating instant mashed potatoes consistently (roughly 1990-present) is about the same as the period between the onset of the Napoleonic Wars and the Irish potato famine in 1845. Why does one thirty-five-year pattern of potato consumption get to be considered authentic cultural heritage while another is self-deception? Aren't they both equally contingent and ephemeral? Why should either be 'real'?This line of reasoning quickly starts to disclaim almost everything as fake. Masſed potatoes could only arise from the technologies of the age of the sail uniting old world tubers and new world dairy. They've only been around for a few centuries. Why should they get to be considered 'real'? For that matter, why is the potato itself considered real? It's a confection whipped up by the Andean farmers of the last few millennia. The only things that are really real on the Altiplano are nightshade and hunger.I find such primitivism unhelpful in making the sort of distinction I aim to make here. Taken to the extreme it suggests that no hominid has experienced reality since the taming of fire. Some might agree that that's the case! But as far as I'm concerned, at least some of the fruits of civilization are real too. I do think there is a way to conceive of the real that admits potatoes, that even admits masſed potatoes, but that gives legitimate reason to have grievance with IMPs.On the Altiplano, the potato emerged through centuries of toil and discernment. Generation after generation of farmers chose only to propagate the solanum tubers that were bigger, tastier, less toxic, more nourishing. It is through such labor that every project of human civilization ultimately progresses - the ability, however imperfectly exercised, to act on the impulse \"yes, more of this\" when something is good, and \"no, less of that\" when it is bad.As cultivators of the real, we get to choose not just among individual potatoes themselves, but among more abstract things like \"memes concerning the preparation of potatoes\". Masſed potatoes were good, and so their meme propagated and strengthened the foodways it came in contact with. It was planted widely in the garden of the real. The WWII potato granule meme was bad, so it was discarded, cast out upon the rocks of the fake.IMPish substitutes subvert this process of cultivation. In masquerading as other cultivars of meme, they weaken our stock both by sneaking into the garden despite their insalubrity, and by causing us, as I did for so long with maſhed potatoes, to reject the healthy older cultivars which they mimic.Perhaps some of them are worth adding to our garden on their own merits. Perhaps many of them are! Many of the things I take for granted as 'real' are as far removed from their natural origins as a Yukon Gold is from those tiny nightshade roots, and in many cases I'm glad that we decided to keep them. But we must be clear-eyed about what each specimen is and what it is not in order to have any hope of making our decisions correctly.Nowadays, I do not judge people for making use of instant mashed potatoes. I certainly take plenty of other prepared food culinary shortcuts myself. In the modern world we all make compromises for the sake of convenience. If we didn't, we'd still be stomping on chuño to survive the winter.But I do think it's important to mind the distinction whenever you notice the IMPish pattern. There is a trick being played on you. You are not eating or watching or doing the Thing that your ancestors did, even if it contains the same ingredient and hides behind the same name. You're planting something new in the garden of the real, and the nourishment it provides for your spirit, or the spirit of your children, may not be the same.Fortunately, it is rare for even the most aggressive IMPish mimic to drive its model to extinction. It took over a decade, but I was eventually able to see past the deception of my father's instant mashed potatoes and seek out the real version. Now I make maſhed potatoes regularly. My garden has one more good thing in it, and one less bad.I even, on a recent visit to my grandmother's house where I cooked St. Patrick's Day dinner, got my dad to make real mashed potatoes himself, in a saucepan over a gas flame. It was the first time he'd ever done so. He enjoyed them.***In the interest of full fairness while writing this review, I purchased a plastic cup of my dad's currently favored \"Buttery Homestyle\" Idahoan brand instant mashed potatoes for $1.99. The preparation was extraordinarily efficient; the aroma was decent; the taste was a reasonable facsimile; but the texture was all wrong - a smothering paste that coated my mouth and constrained my tongue like a straightjacket. 3/10 would not buy again.Sources of potato facts (verified with primary sources linked within whenever possible):https://tedium.co/2017/11/21/mashed-potato-history/https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/627023/mashed-potatoes-historyhttps://spudsmart.com/spud-history-instant-mashed-potatoes/1Ignoring the error that Ainu potato treatments like munini-imo are not 'ancient' at all, deriving from the long tail of the Columbian exchange in the 16th through 19th centuries like every other Old World potato dish. Comparisons between Instant Mashed Potatoes and munini-imo are precisely as inapt as with chuño, for the same reasons.2\"Processed\" is a slippery term that evokes all kinds of chemical perversions, but the physical transformation of chopping into tiny bits is fundamental to the notion. Consider what a \"food processor\" does.3Claude, by the way, estimates that 30-40% of all mashed potatoes eaten in the US are the instant kind. ChatGPT says 25-35%.",

      "content": "Credit: Moyo StudioWith Donald Trump talking about \"federalizing\" DC in order to fight crime in the nation's capital, I think it's a good time to point out that a huge share of the city's criminal justice system is already under federal control. That starts with the US attorney's office, which, unlike a normal federal prosecutor's office, also does the job of a district attorney and prosecutes local crimes. More significantly, the basic local trial court — the DC Superior Court — is technically a federal court whose members need to be confirmed by the Senate. Senate majority leaders, understandably, are normally not that fired up about local trial courts in DC, and they don't like to spend floor time on these confirmations. But that means we have a ton of vacancies — 13 out of 62 Superior Court judgeships are currently vacant. When your courts are understaffed by 20 percent, it's hard to actually try people in a timely manner, especially for offenses that didn't lead to death or serious injury. The federal government also runs pretrial supervision for people who've been arrested and are awaiting their day in court. And the agencies doing this are doing a terrible job:The Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency had drawn Henderson's scorn because, according to the office's 2023 budget documents, it had 2,120 offenders on \"maximum supervision level\" but only 490 outfitted with GPS monitors. The Pretrial Services Agency, meanwhile, was in her sights after a recent debate about the pretrial release of a man accused of shooting 26 rounds from an AR-15 at a car. In a legal filing opposing the move, prosecutors wrote that, \"while GPS monitoring by the vendor may be in real time, PSA's monitoring of defendants is not. PSA only works during normal business hours. Therefore, PSA only finds out about violations that occur at night or on weekends after the fact.\"None of this is Donald Trump's fault, but it is genuinely within his power to fix it. If he wants to make the city safer (and I certainly want it to be safer — it's good that crime has fallen the past two years but it's still very high), he should use the powers already at his disposal. Now for today's questions.lwdlyndale: People seem to get really mad about grocery prices these days, what's the Yglesias \"Food Abundance\" agenda?I'm a little surprised you don't hear more about this, because food really is an area where there are a lot of potential policy levers. Trump's tariffs on imported food, imported fertilizer, and imported farm equipment, for example, are going to push up food prices. But beyond Trump specifically, a lot of ag sector protectionism is worth a second look. I don't think there's good evidence for the MAHA contention that using high-fructose corn syrup rather than cane sugar has negative health consequences. But it's definitely true that HFCS is widely used in part because the US sugar quota system in effect rations the amount of cane sugar that's available in the country. Eliminating those quotas would have many benefits:Cheaper cane sugar would put downward pressure on the price of all sweeteners.Reduced demand for HFCS would free up more cropland for growing other food.Higher earnings for sugar-growing countries in Latin America would ultimately mean better markets for American exports of planes and cars and other finished goods.But an even bigger example is the widespread use of corn-based ethanol as a fuel additive. This came together as a policy back in the days when the US was a huge oil importer and there was a lot of interest in energy independence. It also attracted a bit of an environmental gloss on the theory that burning ethanol is cleaner than burning gasoline. I interviewed Michael Grunwald recently, though, and the major theme of his new book is that the biggest emissions impact of agriculture is land use and deforestation. Using huge swathes of land to grow corn that is turned into ethanol is, in practice, worse for the environment than drilling for oil. And in terms of the power produced, it requires much more land than solar panels. Part of the mechanism by which corn ethanol increases agricultural land use is that it drives up the global price of corn and, through partial substitutability, the price of other staple grains as well. This used to be considered an untouchable policy because of Iowa's swing state status. But Iowa is no longer a swing state, and with food prices hot on the political agenda, I think someone should take it on. It's a good issue for a progressive to champion, but also something that real free market ideologues have always opposed, and you could probably find some Republican partners. Evan M: Even if you set aside the Nazi problem, how well is Substack serving your business?I've been reading a lot of commentary recently about Substack being overpriced and building their brand at the expense of writers... and also predicting more enshittification and perhaps a crash as investors insist they justify their $1B valuation by more growth hacking a la Meta.

      "content": "Few figures loom larger over Western culture than Plato, whose The Republic has profoundly shaped Western thinking for centuries and is among the most assigned texts at English-speaking universities. In it, Plato describes his vision for a perfect society ruled over by what would later be described as a “Philosopher King”—an autocrat trained to wield total control with wisdom. For some 2,000 years, Plato’s notions were accepted by his acolytes with little pushback. But over the past century, his ideas have met growing criticism due to the totalitarian framework in which he situated his idealized Republic. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . In his new book Plato and the Tyrant, Classicist James Romm explores a period in Plato’s life that many historians assert was influential to his conception of power. In his early 40s, before he wrote The Republic, Plato began visiting the Hellenic city-state of Syracuse in an effort to compel the first of two generations of authoritarian leaders toward just rule. By the time Plato arrived in Syracuse, Dionysius the Elder had already maintained decades of dictatorship, writes Romm, “not by turning weapons against his people but by exploiting their fears, their anger and their mistrust of traditional leaders, persuading them to vote away their own freedom.” Plato’s attempts to convince the elder to rule justly so angered him that he sold Plato into slavery, though friends later ransomed his freedom. When the Elder’s son Dionysius the Younger ascended to power, Plato tried again to influence a despot to rule with wisdom and temperance, but failed yet again. This time, his fraught relationship with the younger ruler nearly killed him. Romm argues that an intimate look at this period of Plato’s life can help us understand the man and his ideas in a more sober light, and offers insight into the ways autocracies and autocratic ideas take hold, even today.As Romm notes in his foreword, Sophocles once wrote that tyrants become wise through the company of the wise, but Plato’s story suggests the opposite: that, “The wise can become more tyrannical by the company of tyrants.” Nautilus spoke to Romm about Plato’s dangerous flirtations with tyranny, the process of revealing history once obscured, and the alarming relevance of a millennia-old monocracy.In the foreword for Plato and the Tyrant you discuss how you were more enamored with Plato earlier in your life, until a new generation of students began questioning his vision. How did your view of Plato change? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The Republic is about an ideal society—ideal from Plato’s perspective—and I bought into the characterization that in some ways this society was the best that could be achieved. But my students were horrified, and I started to look at it more skeptically and recognize elements of it that really look nightmarish from our point of view.It was really about the social structures of the Republic and whether to call it a utopia or a dystopia. The life of the military class—the guardians, as Plato calls them, who are “good”—are raised from a young age without access to most literature and art, have to be fed a strict mathematical and theoretical education, and are not permitted to have the kind of personal freedoms that we take for granted in a democratic society. Their sexual lives are strictly regulated as are their material lives—they’re not allowed to own much material wealth—and they’re raised essentially as automatons to serve the state. If you look at it from my students’ perspective, it’s a kind of brainwashing—the education that Plato prescribes.It’s very dangerous to decide that your system has failed and you need something new.What does the story you tell about Plato’s years in Syracuse have to teach us about power and regime change? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Well, I’m hoping we’re not in an era of regime change in this country. We may be, but that remains to be seen. But we are in an era of increasing authoritarianism and the desire of a huge cadre of people to shuck the norms of democracy and move to some other model—some authoritarian model. Plato was also convinced that democracy had failed and was not a viable system, and he wanted to try something new. He described the role of the authoritarian in The Republic as being that of a philosopher king. So he distinguished very clearly ordinary strongmen, whom he called tyrants, from true kings who rule with the benefit of philosophic enlightenment. And when he went to Syracuse, he was hoping that the strongman there—first the father, then the son—could be turned in a philosophic direction. Not necessarily made into philosophers, but at least their authoritarian impulses could be tempered. They could be made just rulers rather than despots. This turned out to be an illusion—a delusion—that he quickly realized was not only hopeless, but that his intervention actually made matters much worse by provoking a factional split in the court and sending the city into a civil war.I don’t know if I can draw any specific lessons other than: It’s very dangerous to decide that your system has failed and you need something new. What you get may be very much worse than what you had. With all of its problems, the fantasy that you can just wipe away democratic traditions and get something in its place that will solve the problems of democracy is a very dangerous one that Plato fell victim to, and that caused terrible chaos in Syracuse as a result.What do Plato’s maneuverings in Syracuse tell us about his legacy?Plato is deeply revered in modern academia. He’s thought of as a kind of a godlike figure. And I think a close look at his interventions in Syracuse, his relations with Dionysius, his Thirteenth letter, his love affair with Dion—if that’s what their relationship was—it humanizes him. It makes him a more approachable figure, a more flawed figure, and also a more human figure. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . In the 1940s, Karl Popper wrote a book called The Spell of Plato, and I discuss it in my introduction. Popper thought it was deeply dangerous and delusional for Western societies—Western democracies—to idealize Plato and not take a hard look at these more disturbing flaws and failings in his career. He wrote at the time of World War II, when fascism was very much threatening to take over the world, and he felt that if we can’t come to a reckoning with who Plato really was—where these ideas about autocracy really came from—then we risk going down the wrong path. I think he was right about that.As you note in the book, modern technology has played a vital role helping us uncover previously obscured aspects of history. What role did it play in Plato and the Tyrant?One of the documents that I rely on is a scroll by a man named Philodemus, who wrote a history of the Platonic Academy starting from Plato’s time, and that work is lost except for a scroll that was recovered from a house in Herculaneum that was destroyed in the volcanic eruption that also buried Pompeii. The library of that house was charred such that the scrolls looked like lumps of ash. They don’t look like anything you could read, but you can read them if you can unroll them—or at least this was always the case, that you needed to unroll them, which required just painstaking care, because otherwise they just fall to pieces. In the 18th century, a technique was developed to unroll a scroll very slowly and carefully, and this was used on the Philodemus scroll. It did damage the scroll, but enough of it was preserved that we could recover substantial amounts of text about Plato’s own life and the founding of the Academy.In this century, a technique has evolved where, by using essentially a CAT scan coupled with AI software, you can get the text from the scrolls without unrolling them. So far, it’s a very slow and expensive process, and very little has been recovered, but it keeps advancing by leaps and bounds, and probably within my lifetime there will be whole texts recovered from these Herculaneum scrolls. There’s over 1,000 of them—or I think almost 1,000 of them preserved—that we don’t have any idea what the contents are. Perhaps there are many lost works in there—works of Sophocles, works of Euripides. There could be treasure troves of classical literature that can be recovered using these new techniques. So that’s very exciting. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Your book deals with themes of freedom versus authoritarianism, justice versus injustice, and the like, which are very much in the news these days. Do you think you were drawn toward these topics by our present day circumstances or did it happen incidentally?It was incidental at first, because I began this book years ago, before the second Trump term was even a possibility. But as it became clear that we were under the threat of an authoritarian regime, I saw that this story really had a lot of relevance—not just because of Plato, but because of the way that the Dionysius regime got started in Syracuse. I devote a lot of my first chapter to exploring the ways in which a tyranny gets founded out of what was a functioning democracy.Syracuse was quite a vital democracy in the late fifth century and had instituted various safeguards to preserve the democracy and keep strongmen from taking power. And yet, when a strongman came along—a charismatic demagogue who was able to breed mistrust among the populace, tell them that the rich and the elites were screwing them, were doing them dirty and colluding with their enemies, the Carthaginians—they bought it hook, line, and sinker. And then the tyrant Dionysius was able to build up his power base, install his loyalists, his troops, his security forces, and make himself impregnable. The financial angle—the fact that Dionysius was able to convince his countrymen to accept bronze coins at the value of silver, and those kinds of shenanigans, the use of cons and lies to build up power—it’s a fascinating process that has all too much resonance with what is happening around us today.

Scientists in Germany have divulged the atmospheric secrets locked within fossil dino teeth by analyzing oxygen isotopes in ancient dental enamel. Reporting their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers at the University of Göttingen, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, and Ruhr University Bochum suggest the air that T. rex breathed was much richer in carbon dioxide than our current-day atmosphere. Oxygen isotope levels in dino teeth from Europe, North America, and Africa also suggest that the sum of Earth’s plant life was twice as photosynthetically active as the planet’s greenery is now. So, during the Mesozoic Era, from 252 million to 66 million years ago, the biosphere and the atmosphere were very different than today.DAGGERS AND DATA: Fossil teeth, like this one from a Tyrannosaurus rex that was excavated in Alberta, Canada, harbor clues that researchers can use to reconstruct ancient climate snapshots.

Older, less reliable, methods of ancient climate reconstruction relied on measuring soil carbonates and marine climate proxies. This was the first time scientists used fossils from terrestrial vertebrates to glimpse past climates.“Our method provides us with completely new insights into the Earth’s past,” said lead author Dingsu Feng of the Geochemistry and Isotope Geology Department of the University of Göttingen in a statement. “We now have the possibility to use fossilized tooth enamel to study the composition of the atmosphere of the early Earth and the productivity of terrestrial and marine vegetation back then. This is crucial for our understanding of long-term climate dynamics.” Lead photo: Teeth from dinosaur fossils, such as this Tyrannosaurus rex discovered at Murray Ranch in Montana, retain signatures of the atmosphere that existed when the creatures roamed the Earth.

You notice it when your hand brushes against it while you're washing your hair, but at first you don't pay it much attention. Then your spouse looks at your neck and asks you \"What's that?\" It's a little brown bump, maybe a mole. You think that maybe you should get it checked out by a dermatologist, but you forget to make an appointment, because work has just been so busy lately. Then a few weeks later you look at the bump again, and it looks noticeably bigger. This time you call the dermatologist, but the soonest they can get you in is three weeks from now. By the time you're in the doctor's office, the bump is at least double the size it was when you noticed it. The doctor is tense and concerned, and he does a biopsy. Five days later you get the result over the phone: Melanoma. \"That's cancer, right?\" you ask, just to confirm, feeling something fall away in the pit of your stomach. \"Yes,\" the doctor's assistant confirms. \"That's cancer.\"Cancer. The word is like the fall of an axe, cutting off the future you had imagined for yourself. Now instead, the days ahead are filled with surgeries, chemotherapy, radiation, CT scans, MRIs. You will never again entirely be free of the eternal gnawing fear of discovering that the cancer has spread. Your hair is going to fall out, you're going to go under the knife, you're going to be weak and sick. You're going to to read everything there is to read about cancer, and it still won't help. It may go into remission, or you may die, but your life will never read the same. This story reflects the sad reality of life for millions of Americans. Cancer is the second most common cause of death, just barely behind heart disease, killing over 600,000 every year. And every year, almost 2 million Americans are diagnosed with new cases of cancer. Some kinds, like prostate cancer, are usually manageable; others, like pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma, are practically death sentences.Now, there's a common myth that cancer is an intractable disease that will never succumb to modern medicine. In 1971, President Richard Nixon launched the so-called \"War on Cancer\"; for many years, it was fashionable to say that cancer had won the war. But in fact, since around 1990, humanity has been making steady gains. Thanks to advances in early detection, screening, and various treatments, as well as the drop in smoking and a vaccine against a virus that causes cervical cancer, death rates have fallen at every age for almost every type of cancer. For a while this was masked by an increase in lung cancer from the smoking boom, but now that's over too:The problem is that since the population is growing steadily older, overall death rates are still higher than they were in Nixon's day:We're delaying death from cancer, but not eliminating it. In recent years, however, an explosion of new therapies has promised to accelerate our progress in treating the disease, changing the very nature of what it means to have cancer. The most promising of these are immunotherapies — medical techniques that use the body's own immune system to attack cancer cells. And of those therapies, one of the most promising is mRNA vaccines.Yes, mRNA vaccines — the same kind of technology that we used to vaccinate Americans against Covid during the pandemic. But it works a little differently. These mRNA cancer vaccines aren't something that everyone takes in advance, to prevent themselves from getting cancer — instead, they're a type of therapy that you take after you get diagnosed with the disease. Often, the vaccines are personalized, meaning that they develop a specific vaccine for your particular cancer. mRNA vaccines, in combination with other therapies, promise to contain many cancers, turning them from a death sentence into a manageable, non-fatal disease. These vaccines are currently in development to fight all of the biggest killers: lung cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. They're even being used against glioblastoma, the most aggressive and common type of brain cancer. There are even some tantalizing results suggesting that mRNA could soon be used to create a universal cancer therapy. Imagine how the story I told at the top of this post would go in an age of highly effective mRNA therapies. Instead of being sentenced to years of gut-wrenching fear, possibly followed by an agonizing death, someone diagnosed with cancer would simply sigh and realize that they would have to spend a bunch of money on treatments for the foreseeable future. That is the world toward which science is taking us.And yet now all of this is in danger. The MAGA movement, which now holds near-absolute political power in America, has gone to war against mRNA technology. RFK Jr., Trump's Secretary of Health and Human Services and a prominent vaccine skeptics, just canceled a large amount of federal funding:The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced this week it is beginning a \"coordinated wind-down\" of federally funded mRNA vaccine development.This includes terminating awards and contracts with pharmaceutical companies and universities and canceling 22 investment projects worth nearly $500 million. While some final-stage contracts will be allowed to be completed, no new mRNA-based projects will be initiated, the HHS said.Officially, all of the cancelled funding is supposedly for mRNA vaccines for upper respiratory illness — basically, Covid and anything that looks remotely like Covid. So officially, cancer research isn't being cancelled — yet. But cancer researchers are terrified that this move will derail their whole field, and with good reason. The chilling effect of this funding cancellation will cause a general loss of enthusiasm for the technology. If you're a researcher developing an mRNA treatment for lung cancer, how would you rate your chances of RFK Jr. approving your therapy for mass use when it has \"mRNA\" in the name? If you're a private funding organization, do you really want to fund a technology that the government — and a large chunk of the American electorate — has an irrational vendetta against? What lab is going to want to allocate resources toward a field that's marked for destruction? And what aspiring researcher is going to want to dedicate their career to it? This is from the ABC News report I cited above:mRNA technology has...been hailed as a potential vector for providing personalized cancer treatments and protection against HIV transmission...It's unclear if any of the BARDA contracts are specifically for cancer vaccines or HIV vaccine development, but [Peter] Hotez [of Baylor College of Medicine] said the real damage is denigrating mRNA technology.\"What he's done is he's caused uncertainty among the American people about the safety and effectiveness of mRNA for any condition, including cancer,\" he said. \"And in fact, mRNA technology is probably the most exciting technology we have now for cancer and also other non-communicable illnesses. ... Even though he may not be canceling any cancer vaccine contracts through BARDA, it may have collateral deleterious in terms of squashing enthusiasm for the technology.\"And The Guardian writes:Researchers fear that therapeutic cancer vaccines will get \"swept up in that tidal wave\" against mRNA vaccines, Aaron Sasson, chief of surgical oncology at Stony Brook University, said in April.When it comes to mRNA breakthroughs, \"the next couple of years are the most critical\", Elias Sayour, a professor for pediatric oncology research at the University of Florida, said...The uncertainty around mRNA specifically, and research broadly, could also discourage researchers and institutions from beginning new projects, he said.So it's very possible that thanks to RFK Jr., the Trump administration, and the MAGA movement writ large, cancer vaccines will not be available nearly as soon as it looked like they would just a few months ago. Eventually, the technology will be developed, with some combination of funding from Europe, China, private companies, and so on. But in the meantime, many people — including many Americans — will experience the nightmare of a traditional cancer diagnosis, like what I described at the top of this post. Why is this happening? Why is the U.S. government attacking the technology that offers us the greatest chance to defeat one of humanity's oldest and most terrible scourges? It's pretty easy to trace the reasons historically. During the pandemic, the antivax movement took over the American right — possibly because of fear of needles, possibly as a macho way to express bravery against the virus itself, possibly because of instinctive dread of modern technology or expert consensus or government recommendations. But whatever the reason, Trump — despite having authorized the project that created mRNA vaccines, and despite wanting to take some deserved credit for defeating Covid — was forced to accede to the wave of antivax sentiment, and to ally with it in order to win reelection in 2024. Part of that meant hiring RFK Jr. and putting him in charge of HHS — a political marriage of convenience.But fundamentally, it's hard to fathom just how America arrived at this juncture. We've certainly seen both sides of the U.S. political divide embrace blatant lies in order to express solidarity. For the right, the biggest lie was always that climate change isn't happening, or isn't caused by humans.1 Climate denial might seem like a lie without consequences — after all, the worst harms from climate change are going to arrive decades in the future. But because green energy technologies also happened to become cheap, the right-wing dogma that anything \"green\" is bad is causing the MAGA movement to oppose the cheapest and most reliable energy sources available:Not having cheap energy is certainly bad. But dying of cancer? You'd think that would be a bridge too far, even for Trump's followers. But recall how during the Covid pandemic, right-wing types died in droves because they refused to take the life-saving vaccine:The case of the Covid vaccines proved proved that plenty of MAGA people are willing to actually risk death in order to make a political statement — and to avoid the loss of face that would come with admitting they were wrong. So it will be with cancer. When RFK inevitably declares — in the face of all the evidence — that mRNA vaccines aren't effective against cancer, and cancels funding and approvals for that whole line of research, it will condemn a great many Americans to terror, pain, and death. And because most Americans never experienced mRNA cancer treatments for themselves, they won't realize the world they're missing out on. When the doctor tells them \"It's cancer\", they won't even think about the wondrous treatments that might have saved their lives — or lay the blame on the bizarre right-wing political movement that, unbeknownst to them, has handed them a death sentence.Subscribe nowShare1Progressives have embraced many lies too, of course — the idea that police don't reduce crime, or that most American live paycheck to paycheck, or that American workers have become poorer since the early 1970s, or that houses have become unaffordable for the American middle class, and so on.",

Well, as we know, memory is a trickster, wily as Coyote in Native American stories. Notebooks help. Here’s a bit from one of mine and some thoughts about it what it all means. a lost world morning bright sun good jazz soprano sax above smoky piano on the record player happy wife gone off to do happy things the world either a flowering of daughters or filled with daughters flowering I eat some less-fat mozzarella tasteless but in a good tasting way drink some spearmint tea too much coffee already and tidy up the house not much but enough nothing to write about today nothing that I want to read quite enough to read enough to sit here resting my hands on the firm regular grain of an oak table while sun pours warm golden honey on my back once in awhile I stir enough to jot something down Well, that world was lost till I picked up an old notebook and found it, the poem (well, maybe just jottings) and the world. We lose a world each day when we go to sleep. No, every hour we lose a hundred – a perfect quantum of a world lasting a micro second until a second quantum pushes it aside. No, not a hundred, not even a million. More. We must lose a galaxy each time we set off in sleep. But each moment sends out a Voyager, a miniature spacecraft carrying artifacts from the Planet Now to a circling earth of the far-off solar system called Then. But memory is a counter-energy, an Enterprise flying from then to now. And then there are notebooks. Some might think of their co-author as a sly Captain Piccard, or, maybe, Coyote. Another way – it’s nice to have memories tucked away in the cupboards of your inner house to pull out so you give the past a shake now and again like looking at a snow-globe in summer and trying to remember what cold felt like. Here’s the next note in the notebook I quoted from above: “I put on Jan Garbarek and the Hilliard Ensemble playing “Parce Mihi Domine” and the smell of incense fills the room. This is not a metaphor. It is what I smell and I need to know why.” Must I believe that I really smelled incense? I think I must, yet I can see Coyote out of the corner of my eye. Maybe another way of thinking about my notebooks – again, The Poetry of the Ordinary. The feet of the young girl running over the grass in the neighborhood park touch the earth lightly, lightly. Her young mother, heavy with her next child, looks at her smiling, and I smile as I walk past in the early evening of a late August. The girl has hardly rump enough to give her shorts purchase. Her mother’s breasts, full and round with the coming of milk, overflow their halter. She sighs as the daughter skips to the fountain, sips, then scurries back with one, two, three cartwheels hurling herself down in a heap of ankles, knees, elbows by her mother’s side. I am some place beneath thinking, a walker and a watcher, drifting in the late summer nowhere to go and going Coda: The notebook is a score of years old. Now, likely, the girl’s grown and gone, along with her not-yet born brother or sister. The mother may be a grandmother. My bad knee makes walking difficult. It is October in this now, and yet, and yet, then is still then and they are still there in my notebook as am I – walking by. Local Habitations Theseus famously says in Midsummer Night’s Dream that the imaginations of the Lunatic, the Lover and the Poet are made of the same stuff. There is truth here. One must be a little mad to face the infinite space of a blank page. One must love the world to want to catch a bit of it, to prevent it from disappearing into the great slough of the past, and one must be madly in love with words to spend hours listening to them sing, hoping they’ll join hands in the dance of a line. He goes on to say that as the poet’s imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name. And so a poem is “a local habitation” of an imagination’s moment. So is a notebook. Yes, well, poems need new readers or old readers rereading to keep from fading away. Old notebooks need – their now older reader. Another memory Books fail. So I look out of the window through a tracery of twig, leaf, and the last berries of autumn at a gray morning sky and think of the negotiations between word and eye. I know I cannot see without words. Earlier, I read that the sense impressions of one-celled animals are not edited for something like a brain, “that only the simplest animals perceive the universe as it is.” I read somewhere else that the invention of glass, something to see through, separates us from the world. So, I live in a house that eye and word have together built out of planks made of guesses about immensity. Coda: Twenty years later I found most of this in a notebook, read it with pleasure finding myself comfortable in this new dwelling looking out of the window into another gray sky. And I see that once again I’ve used the word tracery which I first heard in the spring of 1951 in a short story written by Joan Kennedy for a writing class. I remember loving the word, and now I remember her long, narrow intelligent attractive face and going with her to the Spring Gardenia Dance where we talked much, danced a little. Coyote gives a little, sly bark.",

Simple tips for restoring biodiversity to the land around your home How to start a seed library Help monitor coral reef health without ever putting on a swimsuit “Nature is not optional”: How to restore your yard’s biodiversity When Doug Tallamy bought his 10-acre property in southeastern Pennsylvania in 2000, the former hayfield was covered in invasive plant species. “I’m an entomologist, so I always look for insects, and right away I saw that the insects are not eating these plants,” he recalls. After tackling the non-native species and introducing native plants — though most of them were planted by the animals themselves — the land is now a thriving forest ecosystem. Some 62 species of birds come to the area to breed, and Tallamy has documented 1,360 species of moths to date. “It wasn’t that hard,” says Tallamy, a professor at the department of Entomology and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Delaware. “Nature is resilient. If I can do it, other people can as well.” It takes 6,000 to 9,000 caterpillars to raise one clutch of chickadees to maturity. Credit: Doug Tallamy The experience inspired him to co-found Homegrown National Park, a grassroots conservation initiative helping people regenerate biodiversity on their land by removing invasive plants and adding native ones. Ninety percent of the insects that eat plants can only eat those they co-evolved with, explains Tallamy. “So when you load the environment with a non-native plant it’s essentially removed from the food web.” Few non-native plants are as beloved by Americans as turf grass — lawns cover 40 million acres of land in the U.S., equivalent to the size of Colorado. In addition to using up to nine billion gallons of water daily, they provide next to no value to local biodiversity. But anyone can reintroduce key ecosystem functions to their back yard or front lawn, says Tallamy — and it doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing. “Any way that you can reduce the area of your lawn is a valuable contribution.” Weighed down by negative news? Our smart, bright, weekly newsletter is the uplift you’ve been looking for. [contact-form-7] There are many non-toxic ways to remove turf grass, like solarization using plastic sheets or sheet mulching with cardboard. But despite the rising trend of “meadowscaping,” turning an entire lawn into a meadow is one of the hardest ways to go about restoring biodiversity, says Tallamy. “Starting from seed is very hard unless you have a really blank slate.” In the early days of any restoration project, identifying and removing invasive species is key, so they don’t take valuable resources away from native plants. Those looking to start small can remove parts of their lawn and create islands of native keystone species, balancing a more manicured look with wildlife-friendly areas. This can also pacify unsupportive neighbors or homeowners’ associations, says Tallamy. “Most people don’t know a native plant from a non-native one, but they do know sloppy from neat,” Putting up a sign to explain what you’re doing can also be a good conversation starter. Another effective solution is planting a tree — ideally an oak, depending on location — and creating a pupation site by replacing the lawn underneath with native plants. This does wonders for caterpillars and the birds that depend on them, explains Tallamy, pointing out that it takes 6,000 to 9,000 caterpillars to raise one clutch of chickadees to maturity.

Credit: Doug Tallamy To find the right native keystone plants for these projects, Homegrown National Park provides a number of resources for identifying the right ecoregion and its keystone plants, and connecting with local experts in native planting. Alternatively, connecting with your local extension office is a good first step. “In the past, horticulturists and landscape architects have not thought about what plants do at all. They’ve only thought about what they look like,” says Tallamy. But we can create beautiful landscapes that still retain their ecological functions, he says: “It’s a new challenge — it ought to be fun!” Click here for 10 ways to easily increase the biodiversity on your land. Borrow, grow, return: How one woman started a seed library movement When science teacher Rebecca Newburn decided to start a seed library in her hometown of Richmond, Virginia, she had no experience with the work. After connecting with Seed Savers Exchange and BASIL, the oldest seed lending library in the U.S., she launched the Richmond Grows Seed Lending Library in 2010, making it the seventh such library in the U.S. Seed libraries typically collect locally adapted or heirloom species. Credit: Mike Licht / Flickr Fifteen years later, thanks in no small part to the replicable model pioneered by Newburn, and shared along with detailed resources by the associated Seed Library Network, there are now over 2,600 community-led seed libraries operating in the U.S., where people can “borrow” seeds for their own use and “return” them from their own crop in the next growing cycle. This way, the library can “evolve” along with the local plants and maintain a broader genetic diversity than seeds sold commercially. This, combined with giving gardeners free access to seeds, helps support both plant biodiversity and the wildlife that depends on it for survival. While most are based at public libraries, many are also hosted by farms, community centers, universities and even at private homes. They tend to focus on maintaining a catalogue of locally adapted or heirloom species, combining biodiversity efforts with community education and outreach.

Citizen scientists are diving into marine conservation Coral reefs are the most biologically diverse ecosystem on the planet, hosting a quarter of all marine life despite covering only one percent of the ocean floor. Around the world, citizen scientists are supporting local research and conservation projects by monitoring local reefs and their inhabitants while diving, snorkeling or evaluating data online. Reef Check trains recreational divers around the world to collect standardized scientific data on the health of tropical coral reefs and temperate kelp forests, while Coral Watch, based at the University of Queensland in Australia, developed a freely available Coral Health Chart that lets anyone monitor coral health without prior training and contribute their findings to a global database. Wait, you're not a member yet? Join the Reasons to be Cheerful community by supporting our nonprofit publication and giving what you can. Join Cancel anytime In the U.S., the Rescue a Reef program at the University of Miami hosts field expeditions for scuba-certified volunteers who can help scientists restore local coral populations. Those who want to help protect the Great Barrier Reef don't need to go to Australia or even put on a swimsuit: through Virtual Reef Diver, anyone can help scientists monitor the reef by classifying underwater images from the comfort of their own home.

      "content": "Next week, maybe, there might be a meeting between President Putin and President Trump. Once again, many people are speculating about the end of the war, what it would take for both sides to stop fighting. As it happens, this was the subject of a conversation I had a few weeks ago with a Russian journalist, Konstantin Eggert, who works for Deutsche Welle, Germany's international media company. When I first met him, Konstantin worked for Kommersant, which used to be one of Russia's best newspapers. Now, like so many other Russians I know, he's in exile. The interview was made for DW's Russian-language audience, but it's been posted in English as well. The most important argument is worth repeating, now, before the speculation grows more intense: This is not a war for territory. Putin doesn't need another hundred square kilometers of Donetsk province. His goals are ideological. He wants to to destroy all of Ukraine, to make Ukraine part of a new Russian empire or sphere of influence and to use that victory to undermine NATO and the European Union. As recently as June 20, he said that \"all of Ukraine\" belongs to Russia. Russia's state news agency, RIA Novosti, published two articles on July 30 arguing that \"no one should remain alive in Ukraine\" and \"Ukraine will end very soon.\" Right now, Putin still thinks he can achieve those goals. Until he is convinced otherwise, he will continue fighting. This week, Steve Witkoff, Trump's envoy, was once again in Moscow. No doubt there were discussions about money and energy. Maybe the Russian economy is more precarious than we think, and maybe Putin is looking for a temporary halt to the fighting, although he has never said so in public. Maybe, as some around Trump seem to believe, he can be bribed to stop fighting. But no ceasefire will be permanent until Russia understands that the war was a mistake, a revanchist, imperialist folly, and until Russia understands that Ukraine is a real country, not part of Russia. We still need solidarity, clarity, consistency and the pressure of real sanctions (not random sanctions on India) and continued military support for Ukraine in order to get there. To-Read List: Musk's ghostThe bluster over the supposed Trump-Musk breakup hides a deeper truth: the US government is utterly dependent on Musk's companies. Whatever he says about Trump (and remember, he was the first insider to suggest Trump's name was in the Epstein files) Musk is now so central to so many defense and technology programs that he can't be banished. My colleague Frank Foer writes about this tangled relationship in an excellent article about NASA, which has now been completely superseded by Musk's SpaceX:NASA was born at the height of liberalism's faith in government, and its demise tracks the decline of that faith. As the United States lost confidence in its ability to accomplish great things, it turned to Musk as a potential savior, and ultimately surrendered to him. This isn't an instance of crony capitalism, but a tale about well-meaning administrations, of both parties, pursuing grandiose ambitions without the vision, competence, or funding to realize them.Musk has used that public faith, along with his influence over the federal government and many state and local governments, to contort what were once considered public goods into sources of personal financial gain. Read more here (gift link).NASA isn't the only institution that needs Musk either. Joey Roulette, Cassell Bryan-Low and Tom Balmforth of Reuters have also recently reported a previously unknown story: During Ukraine's critical September 2022 counteroffensive, when the Ukrainian army took back territory in Kharkiv and Kherson provinces, Elon Musk shut down Starlink's internet service in that part of Ukraine. As a result, soldiers could not communicate, drones could not conduct surveillance, artillery could not be guided—leaving Ukrainian service members extremely vulnerable to nearby Russian forces. Musk can alter battlefield outcomes and make life-or-death decisions of a kind that, until recently, only governments had the power to make. Read more here.Finally, in the Nashville Banner, Sarah Grace Taylor reports that Musk's Boring Company has entered a public-private partnership with Tennessee to build a tunnel connecting Nashville's airport to the city's downtown—for the exclusive use of Tesla vehicles. The project was apparently announced without consulting the city government and despite Nashville's geologic challenges (the city's topography is prone to sinkholes and caves). Justin Jones, a Democrat who represents the area in the state legislature, was banned from the press conference. Read more here.

Stay ahead of the curve! P.S.: I usually post these on Sundays, but since the post was ready and GPT-5 was released, I decided to ship it! Enjoy.GPT-5 is here: with the sloppy plots, the major buildup, and subsequent disappointment. It's not the quantum leap it was made out to be, but is another waypoint in the evolution of AI models. But every successive generation seems to grow in size.GPT-2 had about a hundred million parameters in 2019. In just about four years, the parameter count crossed one trillion with GPT-4. GPT-5, whose model architecture is undisclosed, is expected to be in the range of 5-10 trillion parameters — give or take. There are no public numbers to back up these claims.Without a formal background in AI/ML, there is a vague sense that larger is better. So far, this has held true. But, a curious engineering mind poses other questions: What are these parameters? How are they chosen? How come they've gotten so big?In this post, we will answer these questions with a foundational understanding of Transformer architecture used in LLMs, their inner workings, and conclude with a back-of-the-envelope model parameter counting approach that will be able to account for 99% of the parameters used in GPT models, without the rigor of a more formal approach. We'll use the learning to take a stab at the architecture of GPT-5. YMMV.This post is aimed at readers without a background in machine learning concepts. The emphasis is on acquiring a basic understanding of LLMs and model parameters, and learning to make rough calculations to appreciate what goes on inside an LLM.For free subscribers:Birth of the Transformer: A short introduction describing how it all started in 2017 that frames the discussion to follow with historical context.Tokens, Embeddings and Vocabulary: How sentences are broken up, converted to numbers, and form a table of all words that an LLM understands.QKV, Context Window, and Batch Sizes: Understanding the key components required to calculate Attention, what context window means, and why batches are important for training.Attention Calculation Methods: We will look at scaled dot-product attention, and how that is modified to calculate multi-headed attention — a common approach in transformer-based LLMs.Decoder Transformer Architecture: Understanding the internals of the commonly used \"decoder-only\" architecture in LLMs like ChatGPT.For paid subscribers:Parameter counting using Google's BERT-Base.

We will provide a generic formula that is applicable to most model architectures like ChatGPT.Detailed look at GPT2/GPT3: Using published model architecture for early OpenAI models, we will calculate and verify the number of parameters used in GPT2 and GPT3 models.An educated guess at GPT4: While OpenAI did not openly publish model weights for GPT4, several industry experts have guess its model architecture. We will use these estimates to make detailed parameter calculations on GPT4.Speculating on GPT5: We don't know anything about internal model architecture, but we can look at the evolution of GPT models to make educated guesses and estimate the total parameter count.References: A list resources I found useful to learn transformer architecture from the basics.Downloadable Google Sheet you can use to make your own parameter estimates and speculate on GPT-5!Read time: 18-20 minsBirth of the TransformerThe concept of a Transformer was introduced in a revolutionary paper by Google in 2017 called Attention is all you need, which is considered the starting gun for the modern AI race. The problem addressed in the original paper is language translation from English to German, which is a notoriously hard problem due to the way grammar and sentences work. Serialized word-for-word translation does not produce meaningful results, nor is it efficient. For any given word in a sentence, the context of what comes before and after is important. To emulate this awareness, Google researchers introduced the concept of Attention in the context of a neural network (a mathematical imitation of how our brains work) which they referred to as Transformer (only because it sounded cool.)The authors soon realized that the Transformer is capable of much more than translation. It could generate meaningful conversation and generate insights when asked to do so. They also recognized that this approach also applies to audio, images and video, and that the larger this Transformer is made, the better it works. The surprising power of a large language model almost feels like an accident.It scaled beautifully to larger architectures because Attention requires multiplying arrays of numbers called matrices — which, as it turns out, we are really good at doing with computer chips. Today, we are looking at using hundreds of thousands of CPUs and GPUs to make chips think and do our jobs for us.But the process begins with converting human language to the world of numbers, so that we can use chips to perform calculations that allow silicon to think at extraordinary scale. We'll look at how this works next.Tokens, Embeddings, and VocabularySince computers work well with numbers, a sentence is first broken up and encoded into in floating point numbers — which is computer-speak for a number with several decimal places. A sentence could be separated according to words, syllables, punctuations or spaces, and each piece is called a token. Similar representations are possible for images, text or video.Once the input is broken up into tokens, it must be converted to an array of numbers called a vector using the process of embedding. How big this array of numbers or vector is (a quantity labeled dk), depends on the choice of transformer architecture.Embedding is the process of converting a token into an array of numbers.For example, Deepseek R1 full model uses an embedding size of 7,168 floating point numbers. Smaller variants of this model could use lower sizes. GPT-4 likely uses close to 16,000 numbers. The choice of size is critical: too small and it fails to capture intricate relationships between words; too large, and memory requirements explode. The collection of all possible embeddings (think of it as the number form of words) represents the total dictionary of words that the LLM understands, and is referred to as the vocabulary of the model. Deepseek R1 has a total vocabulary size of 129,280 tokens. The total embedding table size is product of token embedding size and vocabulary length. Here it is 7,168 × 129,280 floating point numbers. This large array of numbers is essentially the \"Oxford Dictionary of English\" that an LLM will use.Each row in the embedding table is a token. The collection of all tokens is called the model vocabulary.The table below shows the token embeddings for the sentence \"HTML coders are not considered programmers.\"Token embeddings for \"HTML coders are not considered programmers\" using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model. Source: Huggingface.co.Each floating point number in an embedding can be represented at different levels of precision: Higher precision like float32 (FP32) uses 4 bytes.Half precision formats like float16 (FP16) uses 2 bytes. Low precision formats like int8 uses 1 byte.Higher precision is excellent for training the model, but comes at high memory cost. Lower precision is good for memory savings, and useful for fast inference (a term for using the trained model to generate outputs.) The choice of precision is important to ensure that the LLM will run on the available hardware.Subscribe nowQKV, Context Window, and Batch SizesOnce a token has been embedded into numeric vector format, three unique quantities called Query, Key and Value are then calculated for each embedding, say X. These new vectors (Q, K, V) are essential for computing Attention, and are obtained from the matrix multiplication below.Broadly speaking, we can assign meaning to these quantities as below:Query (Q): This vector is the equivalent of asking - \"Which of the tokens in the sequence are relevant to my input token X (say diet)?\"Key (K): This vector is the response to the query identifying the indices of the tokens that are relevant — \"Tokens 124, 908, and 1,423 are relevant.\"Value (V): This vector provides the content of each of those tokens — \"Token 124 says cow, Token 908 says grass, Token 1,423 says eat.\"The picture above shows the Q, K, V vectors for one token X. In practice, many tokens are taken together and processed at once. We will discuss exactly how.Every row in the matrix X corresponds to a single token embedding like a word. The number of rows depends on how many tokens are taken together — a metric called sequence length or context window. For example, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro uses 1 million tokens in its context window during inference, which corresponds to 1 million row entries in the matrix X. Assuming an embedding vector length of 3,092 and 1 million rows, X is a 2D matrix of size 3,092 × 1 million.When many tokens are taken together in a context window, the input matrix X is 2D with a size of \"dk × context window\".Context window helps the model remember what was presented to it 1 million tokens ago, which means it can draw meaning between a lot of tokens. This is critical when you give an LLM a whole book and ask for a summary, or require it to remember long conversations. Such long context windows are good for inference, but not for training.To speed up the process of training, models process multiple sequences simultaneously in batch sizes anywhere between tens to hundreds. Context windows used for model training will be considerably shorter — like 8,000 to 32,000 tokens — to keep the memory requirements during training in check.As an example: assuming a batch size of 100, sequence length of 10,000 tokens, and token vector length of 3,092, X becomes a 3D matrix of size 3,092 × 10,000 × 100, or about 3 billion floating point numbers. Using larger batch sizes speeds up the training process, which smaller batches are computationally more feasible. This Pareto frontier explains the trade-off nicely.Source: An Empirical Model of Large-Batch Training, OpenAI (arXiv)The matrices WQ, WK and WV are called weight matrices and are obtained from the training process using a method of back-propagation which we won't get into here. Their sizes are based on the embedding vector length, dk. For example, with a 4,096 element long vector like the one used in the GPT3-6.7B model, the weight matrices are of size [4,096 × 4,096]. The means that the Q, K, V matrices calculated from the matrix multiplication equation shown above will also be 4,096 elements long per token, which will expand along three dimensions when context window and batch size is taken into account.Scaled Dot-Product AttentionWith Q, K, V matrices available, the important quantity called Attention as proposed by Google researchers can be calculated using the following function.Let's understand this equation better by looking at its components.Query × Key (Transposed): This is the dot product of the query and key matrices, which requires taking a transpose of the matrix for the math to work. The resulting vector has many numbers, each of which gives you a measure for how well what you asked (query) aligns with what is in the tokens (key). A high value at any point in the vector means there is a lot of relevance; a low value means there is little relevance.√dk: dk is the length of the token embedding which could be 4,096 like in GPT3-6.7B. The dot product is divided by the square root of this embedding to scale the dot product values down to smaller numbers.softmax: This is a mathematical function that converts any vector of length L into a probability of L possible outcomes. After applying the softmax function, the values in the scaled dot-product have probability values between 0 and 1.Dot-product with V: By computing the dot product of the probabilities of token relevance with the token value vector, you get the probabilities of how relevant each token in the context window is to the original query. Scaled dot-product attention computed using Q, K, V vectors when the input token X asks for the relevance of \"diet\" in the context window.We have now computed Attention, and based on how we took the dot product and scaled it, this method is called scaled dot-product attention. From our earlier example, words like cow, grass, and eat will have a high relevance to diet, but a word like chair will not. This also underlines the important of large context windows in making intelligence connections between words; a large context window will find more relevance to tokens and draw meaning from them.Multi-Headed AttentionA better way to capture complex relationships between tokens and improve performance of LLMs is to use multi-headed attention. This is the attention calculation approach adopted by most LLMs today. The step-by-step process looks like this:Compute Q, K, V matrices from the input embedding X like before.Logically break up these matrices into multiple smaller matrices called heads, and calculate attention on each head.Reconstruct the large attention matrix by joining together attention from each head.For example, Q, K, V matrices of size 2,048 can be broken up into 16 heads. This means that size of vectors in each head is 2,048/16 = 128 floating point numbers. The same process of scaled dot product attention described earlier is applied to each of the 16 heads. The attention from each head is then collected at the output to form multi-headed attention. More specifically, it is multiplied by another weight matrix WO before getting the final attention Z. The picture below shows this process for four heads.By sharing this post with just two other friends using the button below, unlock 1-month of paid subscriber benefits! ShareDecoder Transformer ArchitectureWith what we've learned so far, we can now discuss the decoder-only architecture, which is used by OpenAI models such as ChatGPT-4. The decoder is a fundamental building block of a transformer, and has three components.Attention (which we have already discussed)Feedforward network (FFN)Normalizations and residual connectionsA multi-layer Transformer is built by stacking several decoders. The input to the first decoder is word embeddings — the translation of tokens into numbers, but every subsequent decoder gets the output of the previous decoder as input. The figure below shows a transformer with 6 layers of decoders.Decoder-only transformer architecture.Feedforward NetworkThe feedforward network or FFN (sometimes called the multi-level perceptron or MLP) is a two-layer neural network. It is called feedforward because information only moves from input to output, and never backwards.If you're not familiar with the idea of a neural network, it is the mathematical representation of the complex structure of a biological brain.There are neurons represented by little circles in the complex mesh of connections inside the FFN. Each connection is the equivalent of a synapse between any two neurons, represented by a mathematical function called the activation function. The activation function has several constant parameters associated with it, and these are called weights of the FFN which are usually obtained from the LLM training process.The illustration shows orange circles as the input/output neurons and the blue circles as hidden-layer neurons. This network is called a two-layer FFN because there are two layers of weights — one from input to hidden layer, and another from hidden layer to output. The choice of the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the FFN is an important architectural choice in the design of Transformer-based LLMs.Normalization and Residual ConnectionsThese steps are present to maintain a stable numerical environment during the calculation process. As numbers pass through the decoder, they may explode into large numbers unless constrained by the process of repeated normalization at each step. This is a key requirement to getting transformers to work, without which it becomes extremely difficult to scale to larger networks. Residual connections involves adding the input to the output so that the gradients (how fast numbers change) are kept under control in the training process. We'll leave it at that level of detail for now.After the paywall, we will use these concepts to calculate the number of parameters in popular LLMs. Specifically, we will cover:Parameter counting using Google's BERT-Base. We will go through step-by-step and count all the 110 million parameters in the weight matrices used in this early LLM. We will provide a generic formula that is applicable to most model architectures like ChatGPT.Detailed look at GPT2/GPT3: Using published model architecture for early OpenAI models, we will calculate and verify the number of parameters used in GPT2 and GPT3 models.An educated guess at GPT4: While OpenAI did not openly publish model weights for GPT4, several industry experts have guess its model architecture. We will use these estimates to make detailed calculations on GPT4.Speculating on GPT5: There is plenty of online hype about GPT5 and how it is going to be game-changing. We will take a conservative look at the probable model architecture for GPT5 and estimate the total parameter count.References: A list of useful references to learn transformer architecture from the basics.Paid subscribers also get a downloadable Google Sheet you can use to make your own parameter estimates and speculate on GPT-5!

      "content": "I have a new article up at Human Progress on the importance of high-skill immigration. In the article, I discuss the MAGA alliance between technofuturists and nationalists. People within the Trump coalition act as if these groups have a great deal in common, and in areas like crime and DEI, that is true. But I think there's a tendency for the pro-progress side to refuse to see how important high-skill immigration is for creating the kind of world that they want. Among the more intellectual supporters of the 2024 Trump campaign, there was a message that stressed technological progress and a positive outlook toward the future. The American venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's \"Techno-Optimist Manifesto\" became a touchstone for this group, celebrating the virtues of innovation, abundance, and human agency. Rather than focus solely on grievances or cultural retrenchment, these advocates of progress framed the Trump agenda as a rejection of stagnation and an embrace of the future. They argued that the true enemies of progress were the left-leaning bureaucracies, academic institutions, and regulatory regimes that, in their view, had become hostile to risk-taking and entrepreneurship.Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel's famous maxim that \"we were promised flying cars, instead we got 140 characters\" has become a rallying cry among the tech right. Vice President JD Vance, in a high‑profile speech at the AI Action Summit in Paris, struck many of the same notes, warning against overregulation in the name of safety and stressing that we should expect future developments to make workers more productive rather than put them out of jobs.The tech right is of course correct not to fear the future and to see technology as the key to human progress, not a threat to it. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has taken us backward on what is arguably the most important issue from an enhanced-growth perspective: openness toward high-skilled immigration.Human capital—the skills, knowledge, and health of workers—is increasingly the engine of productivity growth, far more so than natural resources or physical inputs. In his 2008 book Triumph of the City, Harvard economist Edward Glaeser shows how American cities have risen or fallen over the past several decades according to their ability to serve as places where smart and talented people can cluster together. Our great industries are built on conglomerations of talent in different locales: tech in Boston and San Francisco; finance in New York City; entertainment in Los Angeles. College towns throughout the country play a similar role on a smaller scale.And since only a minority of the talent in the world belongs to people born in the United States, immigration is necessary to make sure that the most productive workers can cluster together. According to the Indian American venture capitalist Deedy Das, of the 44 members of Meta's recently recruited superintelligence team, who can earn packages of up to $100 million a year, half are from China and 75 percent are first-generation immigrants. As of 2024, 46 percent of Fortune 500 companies were launched by first-generation immigrants (108) or their children (123). A 2022 study by the National Foundation for American Policy showed that this same group had founded or cofounded more than half of the US start-up companies valued at $1 billion or more.Read the whole thing here.Human capital is the key variable determining whether nations succeed or fail. We live in a country that has historically attracted the smartest and most ambitious people in the world, and that is fundamentally more important than things like natural resource endowment or even tax policy, except to the extent that issues like the latter indirectly affect who decides to come here. We can compare the debate over high-skill immigration with that over DEI by seeing what the world would look like if either side got what it wanted. Take university admissions to top graduate programs in STEM, which are responsible for much of our basic research.Wokes would like equal racial representation. So if their maximum goals were accomplished, blacks and Hispanics would be around 25%-30% of scientists, leaving maybe 75% of slots to be determined by merit. You have to also factor out the number of underrepresented minorities who get positions even without the benefits of affirmation action, which is certainly higher than zero. Now imagine a nationalist who wants US companies, labs, and universities to prefer their own citizens. Americans are 4% of the world population. Now, talent is not evenly distributed across the globe, and Americans have certain advantages going for them in any competition, like being from a rich country and already speaking English. If we're being really generous, we might say that in a purely meritocratic system, about 30% of elite scientists will be Americans.All of this means that while the DEI advocate must only redistribute a minority of slots to less deserving applicants, the logic of citizen preferences leads to a much more unbalanced outcome.Asian intelligence combined with American values. At MIT, 40% of graduate students are foreign born. Caltech is even higher, at 47%. The fact that Americans are 4% of the global population and still a majority of these schools is interesting, and likely results in part from US citizenship requirements for some sensitive fields and barriers stopping students coming from abroad.Nativism, then, has much more potential to damage American science than DEI ever could. Of course neither wokes nor nativists can ever expect to get everything that they want, and instead of asking who would be more damaging if they had absolute power, we may approach the question from the perspective of who is likely to do more damage at the margins. I think this comparison still makes restrictionists look worse, given how much foreign talent exists abroad, and how much power the executive branch has on the immigration issue. We've already seen a major crackdown on Chinese students based on national security grounds, which we can assume is mostly pretextual given this administration's tendency to look for any excuses it can find to keep foreigners out of the country. If your perspective is zero-sum, all you might care about is that in college admissions Americans get the most opportunities. But this is a terrible lens through which to understand public policy issues. From the perspective of stimulating growth and having a more innovative economy, the case for high-skill immigration becomes even stronger. The economic based restrictionist arguments are pure lump of labor fallacy. You don't \"help\" Americans or any other group of people by hindering scientific and technological progress. Many will say it's good to let in the world's geniuses, but that we don't need people who are simply slightly above average. Of course, there's no reliable way for government to decide who the geniuses are beforehand. Under such a system, Elon Musk wouldn't have gotten in, and neither would Jensen Huang's parents. The point is that if you accept large amounts of people who are slightly above average, some percentage of them and their children will turn out to make absolutely massive contributions to society.What about those who don't? Well, those migrants will simply improve national IQ and contribute to the country in more mundane ways, helping create a safer nation and higher living standards. God forbid! And if you think they're going to shift the politics of the country in a negative direction, that is a ridiculously speculative argument. You don't forgo benefits that are guaranteed, massive and immediate because you're afraid of costs that are uncertain and far off into the future anyway, giving you a great deal of time to deal with them. And these arguments are becoming more and more difficult to take seriously with the turn away from markets on the right, and JD Vance's emergence as Trump successor, given his hostility to trade and affinity towards Lina Khan and labor unions. I'm old enough to remember when nativists complained that immigration would make the country more socialist, yet as the Republican Party has become more nativist and anti-market at the same time, they have shown themselves to be accommodating towards or even enthusiastic about economic statism as long as it's the type preferred by Americans who share their distaste for foreigners. It is also interesting that just as IQ discourse has become mainstreamed on the right, so has restrictionism targeting both high-skill and low-skill immigration. Taking the impact of IQ seriously means you should be absolutely paranoid about the possibility that American society will lock out the people most likely to contribute to human progress. Is there any good argument against high-skill immigration? Not one that I can see that can be made by anyone who is intelligent, honest, and doesn't prioritize their prejudices over the well being of their country and humanity. If regular Americans don't like the idea of elites who don't look like them, I think they'll get over it when Elite Human Capital cures their diabetes, baldness, and erectile dysfunction.There are people who would rather see their grandmother waste away from Alzheimer's than have to look at more brown faces. If they rarely admit that this is the tradeoff we face, it is due to motivated reasoning. There is no coherent way to accept the reality of IQ and the importance of market forces, and also not be an enthusiastic champion of unlimited high-skill immigration. Thanks for reading.

      "content": "OpenAI GPT-5 is out. I didn't get the embargo because I'm a bit hard on OpenAI at times (which I think is good), but I've read all the early reviews: from Ethan Mollick, Tyler Cowen, Every, Latent Space, METR, Artificial Analysis, and a couple of others. I've watched the 1-hour-long demo, read the four blog posts that OpenAI put out, and the model's system card PDF.I can summarize GPT-5's main improvements in one paragraph: It's cheap, fast at times, and available to all (most people think GPT-4o is state-of-the-art!); it's better across benchmarks, dominating the price-performance Pareto frontier (some think the upgrade is underwhelming, though, especially compared to Anthropic's Claude 4/4.1 models); it simplifies the product offering by internally selecting models for you (at its whim); it has superior tool-use skills which entails better agentic behavior (including research); it's the best model in the world at coding (that's key to help OpenAI devs build GPT-6 sooner); it still fails ARC-AGI 2; and still sucks at creative writing.That's it. It's what you get from checking the sources I checked (which is, all of them). However, there's one more thing that no one emphasized—which is also a win for OpenAI—and this one thing is what I consider the most important improvement GPT-5 brings: a huge reduction in hallucination and deception rates.Earlier this week, I put out a mildly damning post on GPT-5 to heat up the pre-release days. I titled it \"GPT-5: OpenAI's Flagship Model Faces Great Expectations.\" After one long section contextualizing the announcement—GPT-4.5 was a commercial failure but not a technical one; the scaling laws are yielding diminishing returns but not stopping; and OpenAI is not falling behind as revenue and growth soar—I exposed my thesis: AI labs are too focused on raising the ceiling of capabilities (e.g., superhuman smarts, PhD-level knowledge, agentic behavior) and too little focused on raising the floor of capabilities (e.g., please, don't fail this puzzle for kids; please, don't lie to me; please, don't invent information and then bury the cues until I've lost hours of work; and please, pretty please—don't glaze every question I ask as the best question ever asked since the dawn of humanity).I argued AI labs do this because 1) they expect that raising the ceiling will raise the floor, and 2) they don't know how to do it themselves. AI is too weird, I wrote, and that makes it hard to fill the seemingly easy-to-fill gaps. More importantly, I argued that many users are indifferent to gains from model-to-model updates because they only care about the floor rising. In one sentence: no one gives a fuck how smart AI is if it's constantly making up stuff. And I pledged: I'd pay twice the price to get the hallucination rate to zero. Well, friends, somehow, OpenAI has delivered.Hallucinations are not at 0% just yet—and they may never get there—but you'll be glad to learn that the rate at which GPT-5 hallucinates is 44% smaller than GPT-4o (11.6% vs 20.6%) and 78% smaller than o3 when thinking (4.8% vs 22%) for typical chats (the rate is even smaller for \"complex, open-ended, fact-seeking prompts,\" like those in LongFact and FActScore evals, below 1% in some cases). Here are the graphs (they're in the blog post but the information is more complete in the system card):Same thing for the deception rates (e.g., saying it can do something it can't): In standard ChatGPT conversations, it has gone down from 4.8% (o3) to 2.1% (GPT-5):I find it fascinating that the one release I consider a victory (insofar as these results are faithfully reflected in the daily use of 700 million people), the AI community thinks is disappointing. My entire Twitter feed is calling out mistakes in the graphs (can happen to anyone, but come on: during the most important product release of the year!), and extending their AGI timelines (I guess they really, really believed we were getting AGI next year or something).My overall reading is short and sweet (I may have more to report once I've tested it in depth, but I don't think so; in any case I may do an \"implications\" post, which I know you love): Raising the floor of AI capabilities—less making stuff up and fewer lies—is always a good thing. Also, I'm happy it does suck at writing (said the writer). I'm happy that I got it right when I wrote two days ago that it would be received with \"unfair disappointment.\" And, finally, I'm happy that people are starting to realize AGI won't be that easy a target to achieve. With that, make sure to try it and see for yourself; you should have it available in your ChatGPT app. Over and out!",

      "content": "Sometimes the market provides perfect teaching moments. On August 6, 2025, Blackstone Secured Lending Fund delivered one when it marked down its largest holding—a private credit loan to Thoma Bravo-backed software company Medallia Inc.—to approximately 87 cents on the dollar.This single position represented 5.37% of the fund's net assets, totaling more than $380 million at par but now valued at around $338 million—a $42 million hit from one loan. The markdown represents a continued decline from 94 cents two quarters ago to 89 cents last quarter.\"The company is underperforming our expectations and the mark reflects that,\" Brad Marshall, Blackstone's global head of private credit strategies, explained during the earnings call, responding to an analyst who characterized the markdown as evidence of \"some degree of stress.\"The Fundamental Problem with ConcentrationThis situation illustrates why diversification matters more in credit than almost any other asset class. Unlike equity investing, where concentrated positions might generate alpha, credit is fundamentally about avoiding losses rather than hitting home runs. When you're lending money, your upside is capped at getting paid back with interest—but your downside is 100% of your investment.Given market efficiency, smart investors focus on capturing broad, diversified exposure to minimize idiosyncratic risk—the kind of company-specific or manager-specific risk that doesn't compensate you for taking. The goal should be capturing the \"beta\" of the private credit asset class, earning appropriate compensation for credit and illiquidity risks.Unlike equity markets where market-cap weighting theoretically provides efficiency, credit risk resembles a put option sold by the lender. This makes diversification not just helpful, but essential for optimal portfolio construction.A Better Way: Maximum Diversification in PracticeIn my June 11, 2025 Substack column, I highlighted why Cliffwater's CCLFX represented my preferred approach to private credit allocation. The fund's diversification profile demonstrates what proper risk management looks like in this space.As of June 30, 2025, CCLFX's $29.7 billion in assets under management were spread across more than 3,900 loans with minimal concentration:Largest single exposure: Just 0.6% of net assets.Blackstone's largest exposure: 5.37% of net assets—roughly 9 times larger.This isn't just better than Blackstone; CCLFX's 0.6% maximum exposure is half the 1.2% average for the CDLI Index and just 11% of the 5.5% average of the largest 25 BDC lenders, with some funds showing concentration multiples far higher than this average. The fund maintains superior diversification across the top 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 holdings compared to peers, and is even more diversified than its benchmark, the CDLI Index.Beyond Single-Name DiversificationWhile Blackstone's Medallia markdown provides a clear lesson about avoiding concentration, effective private credit investing requires diversification across multiple dimensions:Industry and Sector Diversification: Avoiding overexposure to any single economic sector or industry group that might face systematic challenges.Lender Diversification: Spreading risk across multiple direct lending relationships rather than concentrating with a few large players.Seniority Structure: Maintaining appropriate exposure to first-lien positions versus more subordinated debt.Loan-to-Value Ratios: Understanding and managing the underlying collateral coverage across the portfolio.Sponsor Quality: Ensuring loans are backed by private equity sponsors with proven track records of successful portfolio company management.Leverage Management: Keeping fund-level leverage minimal—ideally no more than necessary to cover operating expenses.Liquidity Management: Maintaining appropriate liquidity buffers for redemptions and new opportunities.The Real Cost of Chasing Yield Through ConcentrationBlackstone's experience with Medallia provides a timely reminder that in credit investing, what looks like higher returns through concentration often simply reflects uncompensated risk-taking. When that single 5.37% position moves against you—as it inevitably will in some cases—the impact on overall fund performance can be substantial.While management fees and expense ratios matter, they shouldn't be the primary criteria for selecting private credit exposure. A slightly higher fee for significantly better diversification and risk management often represents superior value for investors.The Bottom LinePrivate credit can provide attractive risk-adjusted returns and portfolio diversification benefits, but only when approached with appropriate risk management. Blackstone's $42 million lesson from a single loan serves as a powerful reminder that in credit investing, it's not about hitting home runs—it's about consistently getting on base while avoiding strikeouts.For investors seeking private credit exposure, prioritize maximum diversification over concentration, comprehensive risk management over yield chasing, and proven operational excellence over marketing promises.

      "content": "NewsNation's Chris Cuomo wants you to know he's a serious journalist. He's a former CNN anchor, which makes it extra special that he just fell for a laughably bad AI-generated video of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling Sydney Sweeney's jeans ad \"Nazi propaganda.\"The fake AOC in the video, which Cuomo apparently watched and thought \"yes, this seems real,\" says things like \"watching that sultry little temptress squeeze into a Canadian tuxedo\" and talks about Sweeney's \"bouncy little funbags.\" At one point, the AI version of the congresswoman claims that \"skinny, attractive, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, cisgender women descend from the slave-daddy oppressors of this nation.\"And Chris Cuomo, professional news man, looked at this and thought: this is extremely real.\"Nothing about Hamas or people burning jews cars...but Sweeney jeans ad?\" he posted on X. \"Deserved time on floor of congress? What happened to this party?\"The video had a watermark. It literally said \"parody 100% made with AI.\" The account that posted it was called MemeRunnerGPT, and the Instagram post included \"ChatGPT + AI Art\" in the description. Come on, Chris.AOC's response: \"This is a deepfake dude. Please use your critical thinking skills. At this point you're just reposting Facebook memes and calling it journalism.\"After deleting his post (which stayed up for hours, by the way), Cuomo offered this masterpiece of an apology: \"You are correct...that was a deepfake (but it really does sound like you). Thank you for correcting. But now to the central claim: show me you calling on hamas to surrender or addressing the bombing of a car in st louis belonging to the idf american soldier?...dude?\"On his NewsNation show, Cuomo sort of admitted his mistake, saying, \"They got me. AI. It was really good, and it did seem like something she would say, but it wasn't her.\" Then he spent the rest of the segment attacking AOC for not condemning Hamas enough, because when you've been pantsed by a chatbot, the mature response is definitely to double down on your political grievances.The thing is, even if you knew absolutely nothing about AI or deepfakes, the content itself should've been the giveaway. Since when does AOC talk about anyone's \"bouncy little funbags\" on the House floor? When has any member of Congress used the phrase \"sultry little temptress\" in an official capacity? But Cuomo's desire to own the libs was apparently so overwhelming that his brain just shut off completely.Chris Cuomo.

To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.Here's what makes Cuomo's faceplant even more ridiculous. That Sydney Sweeney jeans ad controversy he was so eager to weaponize? That was mostly fake, absolutely manufactured, too. I wrote about this last week. Check that out.So Cuomo didn't just fall for fake content. He fell for fake content about a fake controversy. Layers upon layers of unreality, like a nesting doll made of bullshit.Charlie Warzel at The Atlantic nailed this whole phenomenon. Nobody's actually talking to each other anymore. Everyone's just making statements that become fodder for someone else's statement. It's not discourse, it's just people shouting past each other for engagement.Cuomo wanted to believe it. He needed AOC to be wasting congressional time commenting on Sydney Sweeney or whatever. He needed the Democrats to be the crazy ones obsessing over a jeans ad instead of serious issues. His confirmation bias was so strong it overrode the part of his brain that should've noticed all the red flags signaling that the video was fake.American Eagle's stock went up 24% through all this, by the way. They got exactly what they wanted. And they didn't even have to orchestrate the controversy. The outrage machine has gotten so efficient it's started generating its own fuel. Completely self-sustaining. ShareNo, it doesn't it say something about society that it could be realAfter getting called out, Cuomo did what every person who falls for obvious fake content does. He made it worse.\"You are correct...that was a deepfake (but it really does sound like you),\" he wrote in response to AOC.This is exactly what Christina Pushaw did back in 2022 when she shared a fake Washington Post article about a homophobic dog. She posted a screenshot of a completely fabricated story claiming Taylor Lorenz wrote about Whitney Chewston, a dachshund who'd become a meme. When people pointed out the article didn't exist, her defenders rushed in with the classic: Well, doesn't it say something about the media that this was believable?Like then, I will again say that no, it does not say something about society or the media or whatever that it could be real.Joe Rogan does this constantly. He'll invent a story, get mad about it, find out it's fake, then somehow still be mad because the fact he could imagine it means something profound. There's literally a webcomic about this exact phenomenon because it happens so often. Person believes fake thing, gets corrected, insists their gullibility is actually society's fault.The \"but it really does sound like you\" might be the most telling part. No, Chris, it doesn't sound like her. But in Cuomo's mind, this insane parody was indistinguishable from reality because his brain's been marinating in Twitter so long that he genuinely can't tell the difference anymore.Leave a commentJournalists have to do betterWe've got a problem when the people who are supposed to be checking facts can't spot fakes that literally announce themselves.And it's only getting worse. The AI that fooled Cuomo had obvious tells. Bad lip-syncing, ridiculous dialogue, a giant watermark. But the tech's improving every day. Soon the fakes won't announce themselves. They'll be perfect recreations of real people saying plausible things that never happened.What then? If Cuomo can't spot a fake that's practically waving a flag saying \"I'M FAKE,\" how's he going to handle the sophisticated stuff? How's any journalist who prioritizes partisan point-scoring over basic verification?The answer is they won't. They'll share whatever makes them feel vindicated, whatever confirms their priors, whatever gets engagement. And when they get caught, they'll blame society, or Democrats, or the concept of objective truth itself. Anything but themselves.",

      "content": "Hello all, Well, here's to another relentless week of (mostly bad) AI news. Between the AI bubble discourse—my contribution, a short blog on the implications of an economy propped up by AI, is doing numbers, as they say—and the AI-generated mass shooting victim discourse, I've barely had time to get into OpenAI. The ballooning startup has released its highly anticipated GPT-5 model, as well as its first actually \"open\" model in years, and is considering a share sale that would value it at $500 billion. And then there's the New York Times' whole package of stories on Silicon Valley's new AI-fueled 'Hard Tech' era. That package includes a Mike Isaac piece on the vibe shift in the Bay Area, from the playful-presenting vibes of the Googles and Facebooks of yesteryear, to the survival-of-the-fittest, increasingly right-wing-coded vibes of the AI era, and a Kate Conger report on what that shift has meant for tech workers. A third, by Cade Metz, about \"the Rise of Silicon Valley's Techno-Religion,\" was focused largely on the rationalist, effective altruist, and AI doomer movement rising in the Bay, and whose base is a compound in Berkeley called Lighthaven. The piece's money quote is from Greg M. Epstein, a Harvard chaplain and author of a book about the rise of tech as a new religion. \"What do cultish and fundamentalist religions often do?\" he said. \"They get people to ignore their common sense about problems in the here and now in order to focus their attention on some fantastical future.\"Screenshot of the New York Times' feature by Cade Metz.All this reminded me that not only had I been to the apparently secret grounds of Lighthaven (the Times was denied entry), late last year, where I was invited to attend a closed door meeting of AI researchers, rationalists, doomers, and accelerationists, but I had written an account of the whole affair and left it unpublished. It was during the holidays, I'd never satisfactorily polished the piece, and I wasn't doing the newsletter regularly yet, so I just kind of forgot about it. I regret this! I reread the blog and think there's some worthwhile, even illuminating stuff about this influential scene at the heart of the AI industry, and how it works. So, I figure better late than never, and might as well publish now. The event was called \"The Curve\" and it took place November 22-24th, 2024, so all commentary should be placed in the context of that timeline. I've given the thing a light edit, but mostly left it as I wrote it late last year, so some things will surely be dated. Finally, the requisite note that work like this is now made entirely possible by my subscribers, and especially those paid supporters who chip in $6 a month to make this writing (and editing!) happen. If you're an avid reader, and you're able, consider helping to keep the Blood flowing here. Alright, enough of that. Onwards. Subscribe nowA couple weeks ago, I traveled to Berkeley, CA, to attend the Curve, an invite-only \"AI disagreements\" conference, per its billing. The event was held at Lighthaven, a meeting place for rationalists and effective altruists (EAs), and, according to a report in the Guardian, allegedly purchased with the help of a seven-figure gift from Sam Bankman-Fried. As I stood in the lobby, waiting to check in, I eyed a stack of books on a table by the door, whose title read Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. These are the 660,000-word, multi-volume works of fan fiction written by rationalist Eliezer Yudkowsky, who is famous for his assertion that tech companies are on the cusp of building an AI that will exterminate all human life on this planet.The AI disagreements encountered at the Curve were largely over that very issue—when, exactly, not if, a super-powerful artificial intelligence was going to arise, and how quickly it would wipe out humanity when it did so. I've been to my share of AI conferences by now, and I attended this one because I thought it might be useful to hear this widely influential perspective articulated directly by those who believe it, and because there were top AI researchers and executives from leading companies like Anthropic in attendance, and I'd be able to speak with them one on one. I told myself I'd go in with an open mind, do my best to check my priors at the door, right next to the Harry Potter fan fiction. I mingled with the EA philosophers and the AI researchers and doomers and tech executives. Told there would be accommodations onsite, I arrived to discover that, my having failed to make a reservation in advance, meant either sleeping in a pod or shared dorm-style bedding. Not quite sure I could handle the claustrophobia of a pod, I opted for the dorms. I bunked next to a quiet AI developer who I barely saw the entire weekend and a serious but polite employee of the RAND corporation. The grounds were surprisingly expansive; there were couches and fire pits and winding walkways and decks, all full of people excitedly talking in low voices about artificial general intelligence (AGI) or super intelligence (ASI) and their waning hopes for alignment—that such powerful computer systems would act in concert with the interests of humanity.I did learn a great deal, and there was much that was eye-opening. For one thing, I saw the extent to which some people really, truly, and deeply believe that the AI models like those being developed by OpenAI and Anthropic are just years away from destroying the human race. I had often wondered how much of this concern was performative, a useful narrative for generating meaning at work or spinning up hype about a commercial product—and there are clearly many operators in Silicon Valley, even attendees at this very conference, who are sharply aware of this particular utility, and able to harness it for that end. But there was ample evidence of true belief, even mania, that is not easily feigned. There was one session where people sat in a circle, mourning the coming loss of humanity, in which tears were shed. The first panel I attended was headed up by Yudkowsky, perhaps the movements' leading AI doomer, to use the popular shorthand, which some rationalists onsite seemed to embrace and others rejected. In a packed, standing-room only talk, the man outlined the coming AI apocalypse, and his proposed plan to stop it—basically, a unilateral treaty enforced by the US and China and other world powers to prevent any nation from developing more advanced AI than what is more or less currently commercially available. If nations were to violate this treaty, then military force could be used to destroy their data centers. The conference talks were held under Chatham House Rule, so I won't quote Yudkowsky directly, but suffice to say his viewpoint boils down to what he articulated in a TIME op-ed last year: \"If somebody builds a too-powerful AI, under present conditions, I expect that every single member of the human species and all biological life on Earth dies shortly thereafter.\" At one point in his talk, at the prompting of a question I had sent into the queue, the speaker asked everyone in the room to raise their hand to indicate whether or not they believed AI was on the brink of destroying humanity—about half the room believed on our current path, destruction was imminent. Attendees posted their predicted AGI scenarios on whiteboards inside the compound.This was no fluke. In the next three talks I attended, some variation of \"well by then we're already dead\" or \"then everyone dies\" was uttered by at least one of the speakers. In one panel, a debate between a former OpenAI employee, Daniel Kokotajlo, and Sayash Kapoor, a computer scientist who'd written a book casting doubt on some of these claims, the audience, and the OpenAI employee, seemed outright incredulous that Kapoor did not think AGI posed an immediate threat to society. When the talk was over, the crowd flocked around Kokotajlo, to pepper him with questions, while just a few stragglers approached Kapoor.I admittedly had a hard time with all this, and just a couple hours in, I began to feel pretty uncomfortable—not because I was concerned with what the rationalists were saying about AGI, but because my apparent inability to occupy the same plane of reality was so profound. In none of these talks did I hear any concrete mechanism described through which an AI might become capable of usurping power and enacting mass destruction, or a particularly plausible process through which a system might develop to \"decide\" to orchestrate mass destruction, or the ways it would navigate and/or commandeer the necessary physical hardware to wreak its carnage via a worldwide hodgepodge of different interfaces and coding languages of varying degrees of obsolescence and systems that already frequently break down while communicating with each other. I saw a deep fear that large language models were improving quickly, that the improvements in natural language processing had been so rapid in the last few years that if the lines on the graphs held, we'd be in uncharted territory before long, and maybe already were. But much of the apocalyptic theorizing, as far as I could tell, was premised on AI systems learning how to emulate the work of an AI researcher, becoming more proficient in that field until it is automated entirely. Then these automated AI researchers continue automating that increasingly advanced work, until a threshold is crossed, at which point an AGI emerges. More and more automated systems, and more and more sophisticated prediction software, to me, do not guarantee the emergence of a sentient one. And the notion that this AGI will then be deadly appeared to come from a shared assumption that hyper-intelligent software programs will behave according to tenets of evolutionary psychology, conquering perceived threats to survive, or desirous of converting all materials around it (including humans) into something more useful to its ends. That also seems like a large and at best shaky assumption.There was little credence or attention paid to recent reports that have shown the pace of progress in the frontier models has slowed—many I spoke to felt this was a momentary setback, or that those papers were simply overstated—and there seemed to be a widespread propensity for mapping assumptions that may serve in engineering or in the tech industry onto much broader social phenomena. When extrapolating into the future, many AI safety researchers seemed comfortable making guesses about the historical rate of task replacement in the workplace begot by automation, or how quickly remote workers would be replaced by AI systems (another key road-to-AGI metric for the rationalists). One AI safety expert said, let's just assume in the past that automation has replaced 30% of workplace tasks every generation, as if this were an unknowable thing, as if there were not data about historical automation that could be obtained with research, or as if that data could be so neatly quantified into such a catchy truism. I could not help but think that sociologists and labor historians would have had a coronary on the spot; fortunately, none seem to have been invited.A lot of these conversations seemed to be animated displays of mutual bias confirmation, in other words, between folks who are surely quite good at computational mathematics, or understanding LLM training benchmarks, but who all share similar backgrounds and preoccupations, and who seem to spend more time examining AI output than how it's translating into material reality. It often seemed like folks were excitedly participating in a dire, high-stakes game, trying to win it with the best-argued case for alignment, especially when they were quite literally excitedly participating in a game; Sunday morning was dedicated to a 3-hour tabletop role-playing game meant to realistically simulate the next few years of AI development, to help determine what the AI-dominated future of geopolitics held, and whether humanity would survive.The AGI game in action.(In the game, which was played by 20 or so attendees divided into two teams, AGI is realized around 2027, the US government nationalizes OpenAI, Elon Musk is put in charge of the new organization, a sort of new Manhattan Project for AI, and competition heats up with China; fortunately, the AI was aligned properly, so in the end, humanity is not extinguished. Some of the players were almost disappointed. \"We won on a technicality,\" one said.)The tech press was there, too—Platformer's Casey Newton, myself, the New York Times' Kevin Roose, and Vox's Kelsey Piper, Garrison Lovely, and others. At one point, some of us were sitting on a couch surrounded by Anthropic guys, including co-founder Jack Clark. They were talking about why the public remained skeptical of AI, and someone suggested it was due to the fact that people felt burned by crypto and the metaverse, and just assumed AI was vaporware too. They discussed keeping journals to record what it was like working on AI right now, given the historical magnitude of the moment, and one of the Anthropic staff mentioned that the Manhattan Project physicists kept journals at Los Alamos, too.It was pretty easy to see why so much of the national press coverage has been taken with the \"doomer\" camps like the one gathered at Lighthaven—it is an intensely dramatic story, intensely believed by many rich and intelligent people. Who doesn't want to get the story of the scientists behind the next Manhattan Project—or be a scientist wrestling with the complicated ethics of the next world-shattering Manhattan Project-scale breakthrough? Or making that breakthrough? Not possessing a degree in computer science, or having studied natural language processing for years myself, if even a third of my AI sources were so sure that an all-powerful AI is on the horizon, that would likely inform my coverage, too. No one is immune to biases; my partner is a professor of media studies, perhaps that leads me to skew more critical to the press, or to be overly pedantic in considering the role of biasses in overly long articles like this one. It's even possible I am simply too cynical to see a real and present threat to humanity, though I don't think that's the case. Of course I wouldn't. So many of the AI safety folks I met were nice, earnest, and smart people, but I couldn't shake the sense that the pervasive AI worry wasn't adding up. As I walked the grounds, I'd hear snippets of animated chatter; \"I don't want to over-index on regulation\" or \"imagine 3x remote worker replacement\" or \"the day you get ASI you're dead though.\" But I heard little to no organizing. There was a panel with an AI policy worker who talked about how to lobby DC politicians to care about AI risk, and a screening of a documentary in progress about SB 1047, the AI safety bill that Gavin Newsom vetoed, but apart from that, there was little sense that anyone had much interest in, you know, fighting for humanity. And there were plenty of employees, senior researchers, even executives from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google's Deepmind right there in the building!If you are seriously, legitimately concerned that an emergent technology is about to *exterminate humanity* within the next three years, wouldn't you find yourself compelled to do more than argue with the converted about the particular elements of your end times scenario? Some folks were involved in pushing for SB 1047, but that stalled out; now what? Aren't you starting an all-out effort to pressure those companies to shut down their operations ASAP? That all these folks are under the same roof for three days, and no one's being confronted, or being made uncomfortable, or being protested—not even a little bit—is some of the best evidence I've seen that all the handwringing over AI Safety and x-risk really is just the sort of amped-up cosplaying its critics accuse it of being. And that would be fine, if it wasn't taking oxygen from other pressing issues with AI, like AI systems' penchant for perpetuating discrimination and surveillance, degrading labor conditions, running roughshod over intellectual property, plagiarizing artists' work, and so on. Some attendees openly weren't interested in any of this. The politics in the space appeared to skew rightward, and some relished the way AI promises to break open new markets, free of regulations and constrictions. A former Uber executive, who admitted openly that what his last company did \"was basically regulatory arbitrage\" now says he plans on launching fully automated AI-run businesses, and doesn't want to see any regulation at all. Late Saturday night, I was talking with a policy director, a local freelance journalist, and a senior AI researcher for one of the big AI companies. I asked the AI developer if it bothered him that if everything said at the conference thus far was to be believed, his company was on the cusp of putting millions of people out of work. He said yeah, but what should we do about it? I mentioned an idea or two, and said, you know, his company doesn't have to sell enterprise automation software. A lot of artists and writers were already seeing their wages fall right now. The researcher looked a little pained, and laughed bleakly. It was around that point that the journalist shared that he had made $12,000 that year. The AI researcher easily might have made 30 times that. It echoed a conversation I had with Jack Clark, of Anthropic. It was a bit strange to see him here, in this context; years ago, he'd been a tech journalist, too, and we'd run in some of the same circles. We'd met for coffee some years ago, around when he'd left journalism to start a comms gig at OpenAI, where he'd do a stint before leaving to co-found Anthropic. At first I wonder if it's awkward because I'm coming off my second mass layoff event in as many media jobs, and he's now an executive of a $40 billion company, but then I recall that I'm a member of the press, and he probably just doesn't want to talk to me. He said that what AI is doing to labor might get government to finally spark a conversation about AI's power, and to take it seriously. I wondered—wasn't his company profiting from selling the automation services that was threatening labor in the first place? Anthropic does not, after all, have to partner with Amazon and sell task-automating software. Clark says that's a good point, a good question, and they're gathering data to better understand exactly how job automation is unfolding, and he hopes to be able to make it public. \"I want to release some of that data, to spark a conversation,\" he said.I press him about the AGI business, too. Given he is a former journalist, I can't help but wonder if on some level he doesn't fully buy the imminent super-intelligence narrative either. But he doesn't bite. I ask him if he thinks that AGI, as a construct, is useful in helping executives and managers absolve themselves and their companies of actions that might adversely effect people. \"I don't think they think about it,\" Clark said, excusing himself. The contradictions were overwhelming, and omnipresent. Yet relatively few people here were disagreeing. AGI was an inexorable force, to be debated, even wept over, as it risked destroying us all. I do not intend to demean these concerns, just question them, and what's really going on here. It was all thrown into even sharper relief for me, when, just two weeks after the Curve, I attended a conference in DC on nuclear security, and listened to a former Commander of Stratcom discuss plainly how close we are to the brink of nuclear war, no AI required, at any given time. A phone call would do the trick. I checked out of the Curve confident that there is no conspiracy afoot in Silicon Valley to convince everyone AI is apocalyptically powerful. I left with the sense that there are some smart people in AI—albeit often with apparently limited knowledge of real-world politics, sociology, or industrial history—who see systems improving, have genuine and deep concerns, and other people in AI who find that deep concern very useful for material purposes. Together, they have cultivated a unique and emotionally charged hyper-capitalist value system with its own singular texture, one that is deeply alienating to anyone who has trouble accepting certain premises. I don't know if I have ever been more relieved to leave a conference.The net result, it seems to me, is that the AGI/ASI story imbues the work of building automation software with elevated importance. Framing the rise of AGI as inexorable helps executives, investors, and researchers, even the doom-saying ones, to effectively minimize the qualms of workers and critics worried about more immediate implications of AI software. You have to build a case, an AI executive said at a widely attended talk at the conference, comparing raising concerns over AGI to the way that the US built its case for the invasion of Iraq. But that case was built on faulty evidence, an audience member objected. It was a hell of a demo, though, the AI executive said.

Like many of Almodóvar’s films, the film features a relationship between two women, Ingrid (Julianne Moore) and Martha (Tilda Swinton); the latter now has terminal cancer, and they rekindle their friendship after years of estrangement. The film centers upon a “big ask”—will Ingrid be in the “room next door” while Martha takes a euthanasia pill to end her life? Inexplicably, Martha decides to broach this topic with Ingrid while they sit in the lobby of Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall. Imagine watching this scene at the Lincoln Center theater, that brief meta-cinematic thrill—the viewer is not just next door to the characters on-screen; they are in the very same room.

      "content": "Real GDVheads will know I've spent most of the summer off the grid trying to write my book. They'll know this because I have started the past four posts on gaby del valle dot substack dot com with a preface on how I've been off the grid trying to write my book. When I say \"off the grid\" I really mean it. I did back-to-back residencies in the Adirondacks, one of which had very limited wifi and one of which has no wifi at all. I have to hook my phone up to an ethernet cable to text my friends. All of this is to say that until very recently I was blissfully reading New York Times articles from 1883 and blissfully unaware of the Sydney Sweeney jeans discourse, praise be to God. But now I am at the accursed Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport en route to the even more accursed city of Nashville for a reporting trip1 and I am once again on that damn phone. And I regret to inform you that I have some thoughts about the Sydney Sweeney jeans discourse, though I have virtually nothing to say about the ad itself.The ad is meaningless. The ad, as wrote, is about Sydney Sweeney being hot. There were no Mad Men creative geniuses involved in its creation. There was no Don Draper in the room, and there was certainly no Peggy Olson. Maybe a few years ago someone in the writers room would have been like, \"is it weird to imply that a blonde white woman has good genes?\" and maybe a different ad would've gotten made and maybe that does mean there's been some kind of Vibe Shift. Is Sydney Sweeney a Republican? Maybe, I don't know. Probably, even! She's rich, even if she has convinced herself that she is not. Remember how way back in 2022 people got mad at her for saying she doesn't have enough money to take a six-month break? Sydney Sweeney, unlike some of her Euphoria castmates, is not a nepo baby. And therefore Sydney Sweeney must work all the time to afford the kind of lifestyle the public expects of a starlet, which is why she did the American Eagle ad: because she will do and say just about anything for a check.This is not a value judgement. It is what it is. I'm sure Sydney Sweeney has a rich inner life and maybe even an artistic vision. But a rich inner life and an artistic vision don't pay the bills. You know what does? Selling bars of soap made of your bathwater. Being the kind of woman that would've made teenage boys horny in 1985 and still makes the men who were once those boys horny today. Some of this is due to Sydney Sweeney's genes/jeans, but a lot of it is part of a carefully crafted public persona. The Sydney Sweeney the public sees is a walking Gone Girl cool girl monologue. That Sydney Sweeney works on vintage cars. That Sydney Sweeney would never say hey asshole my eyes are up here because she makes her money not by acting in art films but by starring in ads about how hot she is.Maybe in a different America the jeans/genes pun would scan as being a joke about Sydney Sweeney's symmetrical face and big naturals, but we are living in this America, and in this America we are constantly being suffused with fascist imagery. Benny Johnson is taking soyface selfies outside Alligator Alcatraz. The concentration camp is selling merch. The Department of Homeland Security is posting, like, Thomas Kinkade streetscapes alongside the 14 words. They're posting John Gast's American Progress2 and sneaking 1488 into the caption. The president is saying Sydney Sweeney \"has the HOTTEST ad out there.\" These things are not the same but maybe they are related, and yet none of it is Sydney Sweeney's fault or her problem. Honestly I'm annoyed I'm even talking about this, but I promise I have a point that has nothing—or at least very little—to do with Sydney Sweeney.it's honestly so annoying when they post stuff like this because like guys that's mY BOOK i can't write fast enough to keep up!!! goddamn!!!!!You may recall that Sydney Sweeney is from Spokane, Washington. She reminded the public of this in an SNL monologue last year as a sort of defense in another nonsensical controversy. \"I'm from a town called Spokane, right on the border of Washington and Idaho. I feel a bond to both states. Like when people ask 'Where are you from?' I say Washington. And when people ask, 'Did you go to a Trump-themed party for your mom?' I say I-da-ho.\" If there's one thing people know about Northern Idaho it's that it's full of white supremacists. Last year I went to visit my best friend's hometown of Moscow, Idaho, and whenever I told anyone about it they'd say oh the Nazi town? And I had to say no, actually, that's Coeur d'Alene; Moscow is the Christian nationalist town. But Washington isn't exactly some blue-haired lib paradise either. I mean sure, there's Seattle, the summer of 2020-era CHAZ, etc.3 Beyond the Pacific Coast, however, Washington is pretty conservative. But that's not even the point. I'm not interested in Sydney Sweeney's home state because I'm interested in how she or anyone else from there votes; I'm interested in it because of its role in the West's eugenic projects at the turn of the twentieth century.Washington passed a sterilization law in 1909,4 making it the second state to do so after Indiana. A subsequent law, the 1921 \"Prevention of Procreation,\" act, allowed Washington's state government to forcibly sterilize \"epileptics,\" \"the feeble-minded,\" \"habitual criminals,\" \"sexual perverts,\" and \"moral degenerates.\" By 1931, more than half of US states had some sort of compulsory sterilization law on the books. Despite being an early adopter of eugenic policies, Washington seems to have carried out few compulsory sterilizations under the 1909 and 1921 laws: 685 people were operated on without their consent in Washington while the law was in effect, compared to 20,108 in California, which also passed a sterilization law in 1909.Twenty-seven states implemented eugenic sterilization laws between 1909 and 1931. (from E.S. Gosney's \"Eugenic Sterilization\" in the July 1934 edition of Scientific American)The relative lack of compulsory sterilizations in Washington doesn't mean the state wasn't interested in cultivating a certain kind of population; it means that it was more successful in doing so without resorting to punitive measures. California, the leader in eugenic sterilizations, experienced explosive population growth in the decades following the gold rush. Goldseekers from far-flung reaches of the Pacific Rim flocked to California. \"Influences from outside California soon became part of the texture of daily life,\" historian Elliott West writes in Continental Reckoning. \"The brightly colored Mexican banners and flags displayed in one camp reminded an early visitor of Asian bazaars. Hawaiians strolled about in colorful shirts and silk sashes, Chileans in distinctive wide belts and black ponchos, Indians in military coats but no pants.\" They were joined by Chinese, Tasmanian, Peruvian, and white miners, the latter of whom saw the gold fields as theirs by divine mandate and quickly resorted to violence to ensure they would be. White mobs lynched more than 163 Mexicans in California between 1848 and 1860. Chileans, Chineses, and Hawaiians were also targeted. And yet the state could not rid itself of nonwhite laborers. A half-century later, eugenic sterilization emerged as the solution to California's population problem. California, Alexandra Minna Stern writes in Eugenic Nation, \"was by far the most aggressive sterilizer of any state,\" in part because it was among the most racially diverse.Not so in Washington. The state's population didn't crack six figures until 1890, when it surpassed 357,000 people. This explosive growth—a decade earlier, Washington had fewer than 76,000 residents—was largely a result of the completion of the Northern Pacific's line from the Great Lakes to the Puget Sound in 1883. It was the third transcontinental railroad to be built, and also the furthest north. One critic said it went \"from Nowhere, through No-man's Land, to No Place.\" For the railroad to succeed, it needed to attract settlers. And to lure those settlers, the Northern Pacific and other railroads established immigration bureaus across the United States and Northern Europe.5 \"When railroad promoters dreamed of settlers for their lines,\" the historian Jason Pierce writes, \"they dreamed only in white.\" Helen Hunt Jackson toured the Northern Pacific's Bureau of Immigration in Portland, where she saw \"Swedes, Norwegians, Germans, [and Irish]\" cramming into the office, eager to talk to land officers who spoke their language. \"It was touching to see the brightened faces of his countrymen, as their broken English was answered by him in the familiar words of their own tongue,\" Jackson wrote of the Northern Pacific's Norwegian land officer. Unlike California, the Pacific Northwest stayed almost entirely white. What does this have to do with Sydney Sweeney? Nothing, and also everything. The all-American look she possesses is a centuries-old construction. The railroads selected for this look through their immigration agents and populated the West with blonde-haired blue-eyed farmers through their land bureaus, while at the same time denying service to emancipated slaves from the South. The racial demographics of the Pacific Northwest, like those of the rest of the country, have changed significantly over the past century. To the right, Sydney Sweeney embodies a bygone era, even though, as Doreen St. Félix recently noted in the New Yorker, she's a natural brunette. Genes, like jeans, are passed down from a parent to their offspring. Sydney Sweeney's jeans are blue just like her eyes, and any child she has in the future may very well come out blonde even if her own hair color comes from a box. Now as in the past, the illusion matters more than reality.1 I'd tell you what I'm reporting on but it's a secret. Shhhh!2I saw it at the Autry museum and it's soooo tiny in person btw3Seattle libs are what sent Chris Rufo down his dark path. 4sorry to the nice lady sitting next to me on this flight who had to watch me google \"washington eugenic sterilization law\" from 30,000 feet in the air. 5I wrote about a very fun example of these colonization schemes in a previous post",

There is no person named Elara Voss in the United States. No birth certificate has ever been issued under that name; if you search for it in public records databases, you'll turn up no results. There aren't even any characters named \"Elara Voss\" in any book published before 2023. Until two years ago, the two words didn't ever appear next to each other even by accident. But if you direct almost any L.L.M. to generate a sci-fi story or narrative for you, it will name the main character \"Elara Voss\"--or a similar variation like \"Elara Vex,\" \"Elena Voss,\" or \"Elias Vance\"--with an alarming degree of frequency. Elara Voss is not a real person. Nor is she a public-domain literary character. Nor--yet--a figure of myth or folktale. She's not really anything at all except for name: A string of tokens that has proven irresistibly attractive to a number of different large language models when responding to prompts involving character names and science-fiction and fantasy stories. That is, \"Elara Voss\" is the text that L.L.M.s seem to have have collectively arrived upon as the best response to a prompt like \"what should I name the character in the story I'm writing?\"When, exactly, \"Elara Voss\" and its cognates emerged from the latent space to dominate the Kindle Unlimited store is hard to say. I've seen some people on Twitter hazily suggest that Elara and kin--let's call them promptonyms, to coin a phrase--were present in GPT 3.5 (released in November 2022), but the earliest instance of the names I can find online dates back to August 2023, when an account \"exploring realms through #AIStorytelling & #AIConceptArt\" posted a character sketch of a \"visionary physicist and AI researcher\" named \"Dr. Elara Voss.\" (A \"Dr. Elara Finch\" and a \"Dr. Elara Solis\" each appear a few months earlier.) Voss appears a handful more times on Twitter in similar contexts over the next few months, and pops up on a fan-authored Warhammer 40k wiki as the name of the \"highly respected leader of the Inanis 23rd Voidstalkers.\"But by the same time next year, Elara, Elena, and Elias Voss, Vex, and Vance had become inescapable, to the point that frequent users and A.I.-powered writing apps began to develop specific prompts to avoid them. The promptonyms reportedly appear in every major L.L.M.: GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, DeepSeek, and Grok. An A.I. tinkerer on Reddit playing around with L.L.M. benchmarks last August found that Google's lightweight Gemma model used the name Elara \"39 times in 3 separate stories,\" and Elias \"29 times in 4 separate stories.\" None of the commenters were surprised: \"every time I try using any models for creative writing, doesn't matter whether it's gpt-4, mistral, llama, etc, always the same names come up like Elara or Whispering Woods, etc.,\" one wrote. (Alongside \"Whispering Woods,\" you can file \"Eldora\" as the name of a magic kingdom.) Elara Voss seems to be the promptonym generated most often, others like \"Aris Thorne\" (\"Why is Dr. Aris Thorne everywhere?\" one Redditor wondered) and \"Elias Vance\" are found frequently too:In fact, a whole host of tropes and concepts seem to accompany Dr. Elara wherever she's found. The prototypical \"Elara Voss,\" as described by a text generator, is a doctor, usually a physicist but sometimes a linguist or biologist. (Other times, she's a spaceship captain.) She's generally on the verge of a major breakthrough or discovery (often cosmic or even metaphysical in nature), or is researching some kind of \"anomaly,\" but is isolated, troubled, and sometimes \"haunted\" by what she's learning. She's often found \"trembling\" or her heart is racing; instruments near her are usually \"pulsing.\" The name \"Erebus\" often appears in Dr. Elara stories: a \"Project Erebus\" on which Dr. Elena Vex is working, or a mining colony named \"Erebus-IX\" to which Dr. Elias Vance must travel, or even a \"rogue A.I.\" called Erebus, \"neutralized\" by Dr. Elara Voss.To the more esoterically inclined A.I. schizoposter, Dr. Elara's omnipresence, and the consistency of the motifs generated around her, endow her with a kind of mythological or folkloric quality: She's a divinity, or a culture hero, about whom a set of relatively predictable stories are told. (You can only imagine the kinds of quackery Jung or Joseph Campbell would have gotten up to, given access to L.L.M.s) In this capacity she joins other A.I. cryptids or tulpas--figures like the A.I. ghost \"Loab\" or the \"glitch token\" \"petertodd\"--in a sort of ever-raveling A.I. \"lore\" popular among influencers and some even researchers. There's a strong culture of semi-ironic mysticism around L.L.M.s among people who both genuinely believe in their power and who also understand that creepy fanfic is a powerful marketing tool for the technology. (And that solid ironic-mystical tweets will go viral.)Admittedly, I too have a hard time not giving in to the spooky pleasures of imagining a pantheon of A.I. tulpas emerging from the latent space, a new mythos derived from the hidden structures of our culture. But there are also less occult ways of accounting for the frequency with which Elara and her fellow promptonyms appear. As many people have pointed out, there's a significant character in World of Warcraft named \"Lilian Voss,\" and the volume of text publicly available online about the WoW universe in the form of wikis, walk-throughs, and YouTube transcriptions likely gives the lore a gravitational pull in most models. If you trace back, e.g., Gemma's decision-making process you can see that \"character names,\" as well as \"science fiction\" and \"fantasy,\" are all closely linked in the model to a \"text about World of Warcraft\" neuron, as Abram Jackson shows here and a user called beowulf shows here. (Similarly, there's a character named \"Elara Dorne\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a voluminously covered M.M.O.R.P.G. like WoW. It's a good reminder that L.L.M.s reflect \"culture\" in the narrow sense of \"the culture of text publicly available on the internet in great volume.\")As for her ubiquity across models, that's almost to be expected. All the largest models are trained on effectively the same corpus--i.e., \"almost all publicly available text\"--and the processes by which they are made smooth and sanitary for public release sand down particular differences even further. (They're also likely training on each other's responses, which should lead to additional convergence.)So you might say that Dr. Elara Voss is an emergent legend whose qualities reflect a deep mathematical structure underlying our culture. You might also say she's a statistical agglomeration of science-fiction cliché borne of oversampling video-game wikis. I'm not sure that either of those views is wrong, precisely! What I do know is that we should enjoy her while she lasts: By the next generation of models, she'll almost certainly have been eliminated. As much as we might enjoy the idea of A.I. lore, the companies selling the tech (as fiction-writing software, among other things!) don't like the kind of consistency that points to something other than total magic occurring under the hood.Where did \"stomp-clap\" come from?This week on Twitter a video of the band \"Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes\" performing their hit single \"Home\" on NPR's Tiny Desk in 2010 was widely circulated with the caption \"worst song ever made\":\"Home\" is only the worst song ever if you've never watched one of CatatonicYouths' TikTok music compilations. But the video's hold over Twitter, and the arguments and misconceptions it has generated, have convinced me that the song is nonetheless culturally important. Here, e.g., is someone describing \"Home\" as \"stomp clap hey\" music, a coinage generally used to categorize Mumford and Sons, the Lumineers, and other anthemic stadium-folk bands that dominated retail playlists in the 2010s:But is \"Home\" actually \"stomp clap hey\" music? A debate is currently raging on Twitter about the precise provenance of \"stomp clap\": As other scholars have pointed out, musically speaking \"Home\" bears closer resemblance to a band like Peter Bjorn & John than it does to the car-advertisement bangers of a Mumford & Sons, and the ultimate stomp-clap template owes more of a debt to Arcade Fire than it does to Edward Sharpe. (\"Stomp clap\" is more or less what you get when you replace the French Canadian DNA in Arcade Fire with even more Mormonism, or, alternatively Britishness.) On the other hand, the down-home old-timey cosplay of the lyrics and vibe of \"Home\" (not to mention its success as a single) mark it as a clear cultural forerunner to stomp clap. It seems increasingly clear with hindsight that \"Home\" represented a kind of evolutionary link or turning point in the journey from Pitchfork Indie to Stomp Clap Hey--a band with feet planted in both worlds. (\"Edward Sharpe\" himself was formerly in an electroclash band called Ima Robot.) But the actual genealogy of Stomp Clap, as a genre and an aesthetic, is much more diverse and intricate. To help people more fully understand the complex lineage of Stomp Clap Hey, Read Max has prepared the following diagram. Please share with anyone you know confused about where Stomp Clap Hey came from:The flowchart has been updated since publication to better reflect the position of Mormonism in the genealogy of Stomp Clap Hey.Previously in hipster studies on Read Max: What was the hipster?Previously in anthems on Read Max: Fypcore and the Benson Boone-iverse",

It’s not every minute, or even every day, but maybe once a week, I’m hit by it—slackjawed, staring into the middle distance—frozen by the prospect that someday, maybe pretty soon, everyone will lose their job. At first, I thought these slackjawed fits were just a phase, a passing thing. I’m a philosophy professor; staring into the middle distance isn’t exactly an unknown disease among my kind. But as the years have begun to pass, and the fits have not, I’ve begun to wonder if there’s something deeper to my dread. Does the coming automation of work foretell, as my fits seem to say, an irreparable loss of value in human life? The titans of artificial intelligence tell us that there’s nothing to fear. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, the maker of Claude, suggests that: “historical hunter-gatherer societies might have imagined that life is meaningless without hunting,” and “that our well-fed technological society is devoid of purpose.” But of course, we don’t see our lives that way. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, sounds so similar, the text could have been written by ChatGPT. Even if the jobs of the future will look as “fake” to us as ours do to “a subsistence farmer”, Altman has “no doubt they will feel incredibly important and satisfying to the people doing them.” Alongside these optimists, there are plenty of pessimists who, like me, are filled with dread.

This is justified on the grounds that otherwise, the only housing which will be built will be luxury apartments, unaffordable to anyone but the rich. Rich consumers will get housing, while poor residents will only end up displaced out of their homes.This is wrong. All housing is housing. In fact, in some sense all goods are other goods, because they all trade off against a consumer's budget constraint. When a developer builds luxury apartments, it diverts high income consumers away from other, lower-quality housing, which in turn diverts others, until eventually it has filtered down to the lower classes. Building luxury housing is equivalent to building affordable housing.You don't need to take my word for it – we can trace back the entire chain of people moving. Finland has extremely detailed data on where people live. Bartu, Harjun, and Saarimaa (2023) look at the previous address of people who move into newly constructed housing, and then at the address of the people who moved into the vacated housing; and so on, six rounds of moves down the line. By the fourth round, half the people able to move to better housing came from below median income. Building 100 units of market rate housing in the center of Helsinki is the equivalent of building 66 units of housing in below median income neighborhoods, and the equivalent of 31 units of housing for the bottom quintile. Mast (2021) does the same exercise for the United States, though he has less precise data and must rely upon the characteristics of the neighborhood which people move from. Housing anywhere reduces the price of housing everywhere.Subscribe nowNor does building cause a local increase in rents. There are a number of studies looking at the local impacts of new construction, and they unanimously find that construction reduces local rents. Asquith, Mast and Reed (2019) use a difference-in-differences approach in 11 major US cities with data from Zillow, exploiting idiosyncratic differences in when housing was completed. They found that nearby rents decreased between 5 and 7 percent, and that poor people are more likely to migrate to the area around the new construction. Kate Pennington (2020) uses building fires as an instrumental variable for new buildings. After a building burns down, developers build back better and create more housing than was there before. She can then show that the people who live nearby are actually 17% less likely to be displaced. Building more housing reduces gentrification. Andreas Mense (2025) uses weather shocks as an instrument, on the grounds that heavy rainfall and the intensity of winter frost will both delay construction, in some cases until the next year. (Most outdoor construction stops over the winter). What I appreciate about this paper is that the two instruments are demonstrably uncorrelated with each other. You might have guessed the results already, but building more housing is beneficial to everyone. Read more",

Any questions?ShareTime to fire up the WayBack machine and run the videotape. Why economists shake their heads and sigh when Kevin Hassett's name is brought up, and talk about how great a waste of it all it is.Share Brad DeLong's Grasping RealityBack before 2000, Kevin Hassett and James Glassman spent their days telling lies.Back then, they spent their days telling lies about what bog-standard present-value finance calculations said was then the \"fundamental\" value of the stock market.They claimed that:IF—if, which nobody does—you believed the appropriate equity risk premium vis-à-vis US Treasury bonds was zero, THEN the fundamental-value price-earning ratio for stocks should be 100, and the \"fundamental\" value of the Dow-Jones Index was not its then-current 9000, but four times as much: 36000. HENCE you should be happy going all-in on stocks at anything up to four times their then-current price. And in fact you should go all-in, or mortgage your house and buy even more, in order not to miss the near-term 300% profit from being all-in the DJIA as it imminently converged to what they claimed was its fundamental value over the next three to five years after 1998.That was the title of their book: Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting from the Coming Rise in the Stock Market <https://www.amazon.com/Dow-36-000-Strategy-Profiting/dp/0609806998>. That was their claim: \"our analysis justifies a Dow of about 36,000—not in five or 10 years, but right now.\"(Relative to inflation, a DJIA of 36000 in 1998 corresponds to 72000 today; relative to the size of the economy, A DJIA of 36000 in 1998 corresponds to 108000 today; relative to corporate profits, a DJIA of 36000 corresponds to 180000 today. The DJIA this AM is one quarter of that, just as the DJIA back in 1998 was 1/4 of what it was then. The Glassman-Hassett valuation claims were off by a factor of four then. Their methodology is still off by a factor of four now.)Of course it did not happen.If you had bought the Dow at 9000, and if you were forced by liquidity to sell at the trough over the next half-decade, you did not quadruple but instead lost 20% of your money.If you had been unlucky enough to buy at the peak and be forced by liquidity to sell at the trough, you lost 40%.When challenged by people who said that their math seemed, wrong, Glassman attempted a partial walk-back:I never made such a claim [of a quadrupling]. I said that dividends are probably a lower bound for cash flow to investors and that official earnings are probably an upper bound.... Accept[ing] your definition of cash flow as dividends... the market is not overvalued.... The market should be roughly 50 percent to 100 percent higher [than he currently is]. Using the outer bound (reported earnings), the market should be 300 percent higher...Give a gift subscriptionWhich partial walk-back, of course, involved a big bold-faced lie. Glassman (and Hassett) had not claimed that the fundamental value of the Dow then at 9000 should be in the range of 13500 to 36000—\"roughly 50 percent... higher... [to] 300 percent higher\". Glassman and Hassett had claimed that their fundamental analysis: \"justifies a Dow of about 36,000--not in five or 10 years, but right now.\"Hassett, to my knowledge, did not at the time attempt even a partial walk-back when challenged.The extremely sharp Clive Crook <https://web.archive.org/web/19991231025452/http://www.slate.com/Dialogues/98-04-29/Dialogues.asp?iMsg=1> called Glassman and Hassett on this at the time:You're wrong, plain wrong.... I can imagine reasons for thinking the Dow should be at 36,000... [that] would be logically admissible. This is not the kind of argument you're making. Your reasons for believing that the Dow should be at 36,000 are wrong in the same way that it's wrong to say two plus two equals five. That, in fact, is almost literally what you are saying. According to you, my mistake is that I'm implicitly predicting zero real growth in earnings and dividends. Indeed, you think the market as a whole is making the same error. The fact that earnings have grown faster than inflation for decades is \"little understood,\" you say. If only this record of growth were recognized, the Dow would be already be priced at 36,000.... Can you seriously believe that this has been going on decade after decade without the market's noticing? Doesn't that strike you as just a little unlikely? Of course it's been noticed, very much noticed--so adequately noticed, in fact, that the prospect of real growth in both earnings and dividends is already fully priced into the market.You fail to see this because you haven't understood your \"simple finance formula.\" To get your estimate of 36,000... where your formula says \"payout,\" you have taken this to mean earnings.... [But] if companies pay out every cent of their profits to shareholders... how will they... grow?... Growth requires investment, and that must be paid for by stockholders.... In the real world, of course, this is exactly what they do. Companies pay only some of their earnings out as dividends. As a result, they grow.... The right measure of value is the sum of discounted dividends. This fully captures the effect of capital appreciation because dividends are themselves growing along with the worth of the company...Leave a commentCrook was and is entirely correct, except in one thing.That one thing? I know that in Hassett's case it was not \"because [he had] not understood [his] 'simple finance formula'...\" There is no \"not understood\". Hassett understood and understands the Gordon fundamental-valuation finance equation very well. (Glassman, I am not so sure.)The \"payouts\" Gordon fundamental-valuation equation (a) takes current dividends as payouts and divides them by the difference between the required rate of return and the growth rate of dividends. If you want to use earnings rather than dividends, there is an alternative \"resources\" equation you can use (b) which takes earnings as resources and divides them by the required rate of return. Resources can either be paid out now, or used to produce growth and so higher profits that can be paid out in the future. Add the value of (a) current payouts to the value of (b) growth produced by investment, which is (c) the difference between resources and payouts. When you do that addition \"payouts\" cancel, and you are left with the value of resources. (And you then have to add on a term capturing the company's ability, if it has one, to make investments with above-market returns.)Glassman and Hassett took the \"resources\" from (b) and pretended they were the \"payouts} from (a).They thus double-counted retained and reinvested earnings both as a source of current cash flow and as a driver of profit growth. A given dollar of earnings can be either cash-flow paid out to investors or reinvested to drive profit growth, but not both.THIS IS NOT SUBJECT TO DEBATE. THIS IS 2+2=5. IT IS A LIE TO CLAIM THAT THE TOTAL RESOURCES A COMPANY HAS TO DEPLOY FOR PAYOUTS AND FOR INVESTMENT ARE PAYOUTS, AND SHOULD BE VALUED AS PAYOUTS, PLUS ASSUMING GROWTH WILL CONTINUE. IT IS A LIE TO CLAIM THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE ABOUT WHICH THERE CAN BE DEBATE.In Hassett's case, at least, this is a deliberate, conscious, malevolent lie.Plus—plus!—to get to their Dow 36000 number then, they had to make the highly counterfactual assumption that the equity risk premium really ought to be not smaller but zero. And, to justify the prediction that the DJIA would go to 36000 over the next three to five years, that whatever factors had been causing the actually-existing risk premium were about to completely stop.Why did Glassman and Hassett tell these lies back then? Nobody could ever advance an explanation other than that they wanted to get noticed and sell books.And Hassett, at least, has not changed his MO in the past three decades. Here he is, still telling lies, today about the Bureau of Labor Statistics:Marcus Nunes: The \"Smiling Contrarian\" <https://marcusnunes.substack.com/p/the-smiling-contrarian?utm_source=post-email-title&publication_id=274427>:\" 'who is a strong contender for Fed Chair!... The president who tried to overthrow an election is now threatening to undercut or destroy—with similar accusations of \"rigging\"—any institution that could document his failures or malfeasance. The BLS, who dared release bad employment news, is the latest target.Last Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that job growth during Trump's term was much lower than previously estimated. Trump responded by firing the bureau's commissioner, Erika McEntarfer. He claimed, baselessly, that the numbers were \"rigged,\" and he falsely alleged that the bureau had waited until after the 2024 election to issue a similar revision of job numbers under Joe Biden.Donald Trump: \"In my opinion, today's Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad — Just like when they had three great days around the 2024 Presidential Election, and then, those numbers were \"taken away\" on November 15, 2024, right after the Election, when the Jobs Numbers were massively revised DOWNWARD, making a correction of over 818,000 Jobs — A TOTAL SCAM. Jerome \"Too Late\" Powell is no better! But, the good news is, our Country is doing GREAT!...\"Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, a possible (even likely) appointee for Fed Chair made up a story to keep himself in Trump´s good graces.Hassett knows the bureau isn't partisan. He also knows it revised Biden's job numbers two and a half months before the 2024 election—not afterward, as Trump pretended. In fact, BLS delivered the bad news about Biden's numbers on August 21, 2024, in the middle of the Democratic convention. That was the day before Kamala Harris delivered her acceptance speech. The timing for Democrats couldn't have been worse!On Meet the Press, following the release, Kristen Welker asked Hassett whether he had evidence that the BLS numbers were \"rigged.\" Hassett said yes. The \"hard evidence,\" he told Welker, was that the revision of Biden's numbers \"came out after he withdrew from the presidential campaign\" on July 21, 2024. Hassett said this was part of \"a bunch of patterns that could make people wonder\" about the bureau's trustworthiness.He corrected Trump. The revisions did not come after the election, but more than two months before, in August. But to give it a \"Trump spin\", he said that it came after Joe Biden dropped out of the race! (as if that were relevant!).After the Sunday shows, critics chastised [this is good] Hassett. He could have backed down. But on Monday, when CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin pointed out that the 2024 revision preceded the election, Hassett repeated the same maneuver. The revision \"was after Joe Biden had withdrawn,\" Hassett told Sorkin. He concluded, \"It's a massive failure of our data agencies to be making willy-nilly changes that are difficult to understand and often have apparently partisan patterns.\"What you notice, in all those interviews, is that Hassett is always smiling, even when h's speaking!Hassett became a \"household name\" when he co-wrote (with James Glassman) the book Dow 36,000 at the peak of the dotcom bubble in 1999, saying stocks could \"quadruple tomorrow and still not be too high\".Alas, the Dow soon sank into a 10 year \"drought\", bottoming when the \"Great Financial Crisis\" hit.Hassett resurfaced as markets bottomed, accusing President Barack Obama of declaring a \"war on business\" and warning: \"No wonder that markets are imploding around us.\" Within weeks, an 11-year bull market began, only interrupted by Covid-19, as the Dow was on the cusp of breaking above Hassett's 36000 mark!The chart illustrates.All in all, for Trump, Kevin Hassett seems the \"perfect Fed Chair appointee\"!...Money FetishThe \"Smiling Contrarian\"The president who tried to overthrow an election is now threatening to undercut or destroy—with similar accusations of \"rigging\"—any institution that could document his failures or malfeasance. The BLS, who dared release bad employment news, is the latest target...Read more10 hours ago · Marcus NunesGet 50% off a group subscriptionBack before 2000, I thought that Kevin Hassett had close to destroyed his career by showing that he was a person who was willing to tell bald-faced lies about his analysis, double-down when challenged, and then double-double-down again when challenged more, for no reason other than to sell books. I might have said some things to people who had been on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania when Hassett went to graduate school there about unprofessional behavior of some of their Ph.D.'s, and how this might reflect some deficiencies in the \"moral education\" part of the curriculum. I might have said to Allan Meltzer that it was unprofessional of him to have given the book a blurb, even though Allan claimed that his \"every stock owner should read this book\" blurb had been intended as snark. (Which, I must say, they might have taken with very good graces.)But it did not matter for his career as a hewer of wood and a drawer of water for Republican politicans. Professional Republican politicians seem to have been attracted to an \"economist\" with a demonstrated reputation for being willing to say absolutely anything for some short-term benefit he perceived. Various Presidents and Boards of the American Enterprise Institute similarly had no problem with Hassett. He had a career. His willingness to say whatever he thought he was incentivized to say was a thing people on the other side of the aisle found very pleasing.Never mind that his elders and peers in academia would always shake their heads and sigh when his name came up. Never mind that in the circles in which I moved and move, the principal reaction to Hassett is a kind of pity—a waste of talent, and someone who cannot but look back at his life and see a life wasted. The general reaction seemed to be to judge Hassett more-or-less as Platon had his character Sokrates argue in the Politeia <https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D9%3Apage%3D577> that we should judge a tyrant: as a person who was actually in the condition of the most wretched slave. And we should lament the waste of it all. Why? Because for Kevin, as for the tyrant:His soul [must] be filled with relentless groveling and no choice. The best and most reasonable parts of his mind are slaves to a small part of it. And that small part of his mind, which is the worst and the most frenzied, ruthlessly bosses him around... You [have to] say that that is the lot of a slave.... That is the mind that, least of all, does what it truly wishes. Rather, always yanked around by the relentless itch of neediness, it ends up tangled in chaos and regret.... He is doomed to be perpetually hungry, tormented by cravings he can never satisfy.... more than half-mad by the internal yelling of his own urges.... Such a person is far and away the most wretched one possible...Refer a friendAnd if the mental imbalance of such a person is such that he does not recognized how pitiable his situation is? Then that only makes him more pitiable still, and it all even more of a waste. One is driven to give him the advice given by Dean Wurmer in Animal House: \"that is no way to go though life, son...\"And it would be really, really unfortunate for the country and the world were any senator to vote to confirm a Kevin Hassett as Fed Chair.Leave a commentSubscribe nowIf reading this gets you Value Above Replacement, then become a free subscriber to this newsletter.

He did not have high confidence in going undetected; after all, his opening sentence (“A rising spirit is haunting America: the spirit of a true Christian Right”) is a blatant rip-off of one of the most famous sentences in world literature. Nonetheless, American Reformer ran the piece under the headline “The Liberal Consensus and the New Christian Right.” All good fun. But what flabbergasted Lindsay was what happened when he revealed the hoax. Instead of repudiating its inadvertent endorsement of the bloodiest left-wing ideology in human history, the supposedly conservative journal embraced it: “While we were unaware of its authorship and motive, it is still a reasonable aggregation of some New Right ideas (repackaged into Marx’s effective rhetoric), and we have corrected its authorship to properly credit Mr. Lindsay.” More here.

Colophon: All the rest. Good ideas are popular (permalink) In democracies, we're told, politicians exist to reflect and enact the popular will; but the truth is, politicians' primary occupation is thwarting the will of the people, in preference to the will of a small group of wealthy, powerful people. That's an empirical finding, based on a study of 1,779 policy outcomes, which concluded that: economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence. https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B The policy preferences of the public would give the leadership of any mainstream party the fantods. Here's a remarkable thread where the economic anthropologist Jason Hickel summarizes recent polling on public preferences: https://x.com/jasonhickel/status/1953126243118813556 \"Capitalism does more harm than good\" (56% globally; 69% in France; 74% in India) https://www.edelman.com/news-awards/2020-edelman-trust-barometer In 28 of 34 countries, the majority are anti-capitalist: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecaf.12591 A majority of Canadians, Australians and Britons aged 18-34 believe \"socialism will improve the economy and well-being of citizens\": https://jacobin.com/2023/03/socialism-right-wing-think-tank-polling-support-anti-capitalism 62% of Americans aged 18-30 \"hold favorable views of socialism\" (61% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism vs 50% who are positive on capitalism): https://www.cato.org/blog/81-say-they-cant-afford-pay-higher-taxes-next-year Majority of youth climate group members blame \"a system that puts profit over people and planet\" and 89% say that system is capitalism: https://www.climatevanguard.org/publications-all/mapping-the-global-youth-climate-movement Majority support a national job guarantee (72% UK, 78% US; 79% France): https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2023/11/24/how-popular-are-post-capitalist-ideas Majority of Americans support workplace democracy (unions, worker shareholders and board seats): https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/what-do-americans-want-from-private-government-experimental-evidence-demonstrates-that-americans-want-workplace-democracy/D9C1DBB6F95D9EEA35A34ABF016511F4 Majority of Britons support public ownership of services (education, healthcare, rail, water, postal service, parks); 64% of Americans support universal public health care; 64% support public options for internet, child care, and housing; https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2023/11/24/how-popular-are-post-capitalist-ideas 74% of Britons support national, permanent rent-controls; 71% of Bay Staters and 55% of Californians agree: https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2023/11/24/how-popular-are-post-capitalist-ideas 72% of Americans support a living wage; 87% of Britons agree: https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2023/11/24/how-popular-are-post-capitalist-ideas 84% of Europeans support a millionaires' tax; 69% of Americans agree: https://wid.world/document/international-attitudes-toward-global-policies-for-poverty-reduction-and-climates-change/ Majority of people in 40 countries want 4:1 maximum pay ratios for CEOs and their lowest-paid workers: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691614549773 71% of Europeans want transformational reform of the UN and IMF, with proportional votes based on member-states' populations (58% of Americans agree): https://wid.world/document/international-attitudes-toward-global-policies-for-poverty-reduction-and-climates-change/ Majorities of Europeans and Americans support \"compensating low-income countries for climate damages, funding renewable energy in low-income countries, and supporting low-income countries to adapt to climate change\": https://wid.world/document/international-attitudes-toward-global-policies-for-poverty-reduction-and-climates-change/ 80-90% of people in medium/high-income countries want to finance this with a global tax on millionaires: https://wid.world/document/international-attitudes-toward-global-policies-for-poverty-reduction-and-climates-change/ Hickel's thread reminded of the 2023 Pew report that found that: 65% of Americans feel exhausted when thinking about politics; 63% have little/no confidence in the US political system; 4% think the US system works well: https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/18/the-people-no/#tell-ya-what-i-want-what-i-really-really-want Unsurprisingly: 87% of Americans want Congressional term limits; 79% favor age limits for Congress and the Supreme Court; 62% support automatic voter-registration for every American; 65% want to abolish the Electoral College (47% of Republicans agree!); 70% believe voters have too little influence over their representatives; 83% of Republicans say big donors call the shots (80% of Dems agree); 72% of Americans want to limit campaign contributions (75% D/71% R); 58% of Americans believe it is possible to get money out of politics. So on the one hand, this is all pretty dismal. It also makes the trend towards electing anti-democratic politicians who want to abolish elections a lot easier to understand: if you (correctly) believe you live in a world where politicians don't care about you, then why not vote for a strongman who'll punish your enemies and maybe leave you with a few more crumbs? But on the other hand, this is very exciting, because it shows us what a truly democratic world would look like (and just how different that world would be from the billionaire astroturf-dominated social media world)! If the popular will can achieve primacy, we would live in a veritable paradise! It also explains how candidates like Zohran Mamdani were able to clobber the political establishment simply by a) telling people that he would do popular things; and b) convincing them that he meant it. Suppressing popular preferences in (nominal) democracies isn't easy. It requires absolute unity of the ruling classes. Whenever the faintest crack appears in capital's unity, good policies gush out of it. That's what's happened with antitrust this decade, where the divisions between billionaire rentiers like Apple/Google and the millionaire capitalists who want to escape their 30% app tax has allowed a rush of effective antitrust enforcement to sweep the world, to the detriment of both: https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/28/mamdani/#trustbusting By not hanging together, the rich let us hang them separately. And since there is no honor among thieves – since the rich want nothing more to eat one anothers' lunches – there is disunity aplenty for us to exploit. We just have to remember that we are the (very large) majority and act like it.

It's not just writing—it's algorithmically optimized semantic synthesis. This enables users to streamline content creation workflows, enhance productivity, and generate human-adjacent prose at scale.AI can do a lot. But a lot of people aren't using it much, if at all. These people are liable to be left behind as a result of failing to adapt to the new technology, rather like those who never learned to type even after the dawn of computers.

      "content": "After a busy day at work as a prompt engineer for a marketing agency — working from your laptop in your own living room — it’s time to relax. You scroll through TikTok for a while, and then upload a video about the novel you discovered recently from a Threads post. After ordering dinner through DoorDash, you ask ChatGPT to recommend an itinerary for your upcoming vacation, and then make travel reservations using Expedia.Perhaps this seems a strange way of life, but it is hardly a fantasy. Boosted by the pandemic, online shopping has grown from less than 3% to over a quarter of retail sales in the U.K., and in the U.S. it’s up to 16%. Banking and booking travel online are commonplace. Hundreds of millions of people post entertaining or informative content on the internet, contribute open source software or engage in crowdsourced innovation or scientific projects via Zooniverse and other platforms.But as we consume online, online consumes us. Even if we set aside the much-debated detriments to mental health and social relations, there are significant costs to living life online: It has become infuriatingly hard to get beyond computerized customer service bots that are unable to answer queries, and filling out government forms or wading through badly designed websites can take ages.Living in a digital realm poses a serious problem for measuring what’s going on in the economy. By definition, “the economy” — that is, gross domestic product or GDP — excludes activities done at home and those involving no monetary transactions. All those do-it-yourself digital activities take some components of the economy across a boundary into the household. Digital services we don’t pay for — social media, smartphone apps, Google searches — have no impact on GDP because their price is zero.What’s more, these free services are increasingly replacing things that previously did have a price and were therefore accounted for in GDP. As Nobel-winning economist Gary Becker pointed out long ago, shifts of this kind make it difficult to interpret the published figures for national wealth, economic output and productivity.In any case, it is far from clear that more productivity, as conventionally measured, is always a good thing. Consider the automatic checkouts steadily colonizing stores. They substitute capital and software for human labor, and so will improve the sales per employee figures for the stores. But they rely on shoppers’ free labor instead. Just as with online banking, which often saves time but occasionally doesn’t, we should be accounting for time spent and saved as well as money spent and saved.Official statistical agencies rarely collect the kind of data that would be useful for tracking patterns of consumption in our ever-more-digital economy. Nor are they able to fit the new patterns into the existing framework of definitions and categories; it’s like trying to do a complicated jigsaw puzzle when the pieces don’t correspond to the picture on the box. \"Statistics matter. They are the only lens available to governments and citizens to understand and monitor what is happening to the broader economy.\" The same is true of the business side of the economy: the production of goods and services. As the U.S. and other countries are finding out, statistics on global supply chains are sparse, although the Trump administration’s tariffs and haphazard economic policies are making it all too clear which imports were crucial. Even overall trade figures are inadequate, as it is only after two or three years that data is published on how a country’s exports rely on imports from a different country.Official economic statistics struggle with other aspects of production. Companies like Apple or Nike can be misclassified as manufacturers even if they outsource all their production. Some flagship “manufacturing” companies increasingly make profits from services — maintenance or software or otherwise — that they sell alongside their products, like Rolls-Royce with airplane engines or John Deere with tractors. The printer ink phenomenon, which ties customers to an ongoing service, is widespread. This boosts profits, which can of course be measured, but it doesn’t seem to reflect genuine economic value creation.The statistical fog will only get worse as generative AI use spreads. There are few broad studies on what businesses are using AI for, but those that do use it seem to be more profitable and are growing employment. (So far at least. This may well change.) Yet if, in the not-too-distant future, my personal AI agent conducts affairs on my behalf with my bank’s AI bot, is that valuable economic activity? How should it be measured in any case?The absence of basic data collection about the whole range of digital activities in the economy is a problem; statistical agencies still often rely on surveys, which are getting fewer and fewer responses as time goes by. A new architecture of data collection will be required if governments and businesses are going to be able to track basic economic phenomena. Unfortunately, the official agencies are being squeezed everywhere, and particularly in the U.S., so they have scant capacity to innovate their approach.There is, though, a much more fundamental question: What activities in a digitally transformed economy create value, and who profits from that value?Businesspeople tend to think in terms of “value added,” which deducts costs of production and sales from revenues. Economists want to adjust both costs and revenues for inflation in the relevant prices. Similarly, we economists want to adjust measurements of consumer expenditure when things get more expensive. Adjusting for price changes produces what, in econ-jargon, are known as “real-terms measures.”These measures are not real at all; they are hypothetical constructs — ideas. The price indices used to produce them are calculated using complicated formulas that involve some dubious assumptions. \"Countries without good statistics are hobbled in their ability to govern or to understand public grievances.\" For example, one of the simpler formulas used asks how much the products purchased last year would cost today. Another looks at the reverse: how the price of products bought today has changed since last year. If the range of products varies over time, as of course it does, all kinds of statistical techniques are applied to remove old items and patch in new ones. But this means that price indices are incredibly hard to interpret over longer periods of time — such as the 18 years since the launch of the iPhone.All the formulas (the published price indices use complicated alternatives) also make two fundamental, and incorrect, assumptions. One is that all the products in a price index are substitutes for each other. The other is that patterns of consumption do not change as people’s incomes increase. In a reasonably stable economy, these assumptions can perhaps be excused. But not when the structure of the economy is being transformed.Take the assumption of substitutability. Textbooks will switch from apples to oranges or coffee to lemonade to justify the algebra involved in constructing a price index. The aim to combine many products into a single number is heroic, so simplifying assumptions have to be made. But of course, nobody can eat their smartphone data plan.As for assuming that consumption patterns are independent of income, this is so clearly problematic that it has led to research into and sometimes publication of a range of different consumer price indices using the typical mix of goods and services purchased by people at different income levels. Low-income households spend a much higher share of their money on energy and food — although bizarrely, the CPI labeled “core,” often the focus of commentary on economic statistics, excludes these two essentials on the grounds that their prices are more volatile than other items.There are subtler problems here. GDP uses market prices to add up the amount of products sold and in price indices. There is a presumption that a higher GDP is a good thing. But what if prices reflect market power? Should a measure of the economy intended to reflect how well-off the country is adjust for monopolies? If the GDP growth attributable to the top 1% of the population is removed, U.S. growth since the financial crisis looks much less healthy, and the gap between the U.S. and other Western economies is much reduced.The period of transformational change being experienced in Western economies is making the standard statistical framework steadily more obsolete. This should not be a surprise — it happens with every technological revolution. It took many decades after the 19th-century Industrial Revolution for governments to start collecting regular statistics on industry, and several more after that effort began to get to the framework Western economies have been using for the past 80 years.Statistics matter. They are the only lens available to governments and citizens to understand and monitor what is happening to the broader economy. Countries without good statistics are hobbled in their ability to govern or to understand public grievances. Voters in many Western countries are signaling discontent with their governments, often with a striking disconnect between what voters believe is true and what the official economic statistics show. There is something in people’s daily experience that the standard indicators, such as GDP growth and levels of employment, are not capturing. \"Living in a digital realm poses a serious problem for measuring what’s going on in the economy.\" The importance of economic statistics was well understood by early pioneers. William Petty, whose “Political Arithmetick” (1690) was one of the first attempts to measure the U.K.’s economic strength, intended the exercise to provide vital information about military capacity in the war against the French, as indeed it did. The title made the point concisely. The invention of GDP by British and American economists (including John Maynard Keynes) during the Second World War had a similarly effective strategic purpose. It has been described as making a material difference to the outcome of the conflict, as the Allies managed their national resources more effectively than their enemies. Earlier, Simon Kuznets had constructed measures of U.S. national income to inform the federal government's efforts to counter the Depression. Similarly, measures of inflation that track changes in the cost of living have always been highly politically charged. Inflation redistributes purchasing power away from people whose wages do not keep up with price rises, while asset owners tend to gain from even higher asset price inflation. Even the formulas become matters of political debate, like when pension or social security payments are linked to a particular measurement, such as the CPI. Even beyond these headline figures, other statistics — or their absence — can shape decisions in ways that have a significant impact. If the government does not know where companies make and transfer their profits, the corporate tax base will steadily evaporate. If it cares about national economic security and resilience, it should be collecting data on supply networks. Official statistics are an essential public good, one that should be accessible to all (with due regard for privacy and commercial confidentiality). They provide the information governments need to govern well, are useful to businesses and enable the public to hold to account those with power over their standard of living and quality of life.It is time for better statistics that track the economy as it is today, not as it was eight decades ago. This ought to mean investing in the collection of statistics. Yet many governments are squeezing the budgets of statistical agencies. This reveals something important about the distribution of power now that the resources going into official statistics are declining just as private corporations invest more.A new approach is needed. Economists need to step up to the challenge of defining the concepts and measures that will effectively describe the transformed, digitized economy. How, for example, should statisticians be measuring the additional economic value created by agentic AI or huge new datacenters requiring scarce minerals and water to operate? New sources of data will be required — online data, cellphone data, satellite images or urban sensors — and new methods to synthesize this into useful indicators. Statistical agencies will need to find the resources to do research themselves, even if that means diverting funding from their 20th-century activities. Importantly, though, the politicians who make the ultimate decisions about funding need to accept that economic statistics matter. For some, there is a strong instinct to hide or even distort uncomfortable information, be it too-high inflation or a rapidly increasing debt burden. For example, Argentina notoriously stopped publishing inflation figures for a while in the early 2010s, while Greece fiddled with its GDP figures in the 2000s to be able to borrow more. In neither case did altering the figures change the reality, and reality won out in the end. Throughout Western economies now, politically polarized and facing daunting economic uncertainties, cutting or altering official statistics may seem an appealing option. The Trump administration seems to have made this choice already.If this is the case, the responsibility to develop a fit-for-purpose statistical framework and set of resources falls to researchers and others with the capacity to help everyone understand today’s reality. Such private efforts will never provide the equivalent of the public good of official statistics, but they can pave the way for a clearer-sighted future, just as pioneers of the past did in their time.

      "content": "A passenger at LAX in the 1970s. Air travel has come a long way since then. Via r/TheWayWeWere.My overriding philosophy for this newsletter is to write about what I know about. And I know a lot about air travel. Over the past 15 years, I've taken something like 800 flights.1 That tally includes literally everything from the middle seat of the bathroom-adjacent back row on Spirit Airlines to first class on Emirates (I lucked into a free upgrade).So as we're approaching the peak of summer travel season, it's time to put this out there: U.S. air travel gets a bad rap. Many American airports are much more pleasant than they were even a few years ago. And security lines are often faster — as of last month, you don't even have to take your shoes off anymore. We can all remember our worst experiences, and I've had a few, from having to double back because I left my wallet at my hotel in Raleigh to not realizing that my connection in Sao Paulo was at a different airport. But the default experience is trending toward efficiency.Guidance on when to arrive at the airport has been slow to catch up, however. At View From The Wing, Gary Leff recently estimated that $83 billion worth of productive time last year was wasted because of people showing up hours in advance at American airports.Although I agree with the spirit of Leff's critique, I don't quite agree with his calculations. For one thing, excess time at the airport isn't exactly wasted. Some airports can be pleasant spots for people watching, putting headphones on and getting some work done, or having a refreshing pre-flight beverage.2But also, although many authorities recommend arriving as early as 2 or 2½ hours in advance even for domestic flights, you really don't need to do that. Not unless you're facing a multiplicity of adverse circumstances. As in some other areas, the experts are irrationally risk-averse.ShareTrue, most people don't follow TSA guidance to a T, but many travelers are nittier about air travel than they need to be. An (unscientific) poll on X by the economist Bryan Caplan found that more than a quarter of his respondents arrive at the airport at least 100 minutes ahead of time as a default.I often cut things closer. And while I like to gamble, my track record with flights is pretty good. Out of those ~800 departures, I've missed three or four due to being late, a rate of about 0.5 percent. That isn't zero, but I generally agree with the phrase \"if you never miss the plane, you're spending too much time in airports.\" Missing a flight is not an existential crisis. If there's another flight on the same route in an hour, it may hardly matter at all, in fact.Still, the biggest problem with that two-hour rule is that it's one-size-fits-all. There are circumstances where you'll really want to budget that much time, or even more, but others when you can pull up to the gate 45 minutes before departure and be just fine. So here are my detailed heuristics, honed from decades of experience. (Maybe all that time at airports wasn't wasted after all.) For paid subscribers, I'll even include a spreadsheet so that you can roll your own numbers.The base caseMy default is to allocate 60 minutes — one hour, not two — from walking through the airport doors until departure time. There are several important assumptions behind this, however, which usually fit my circumstances but might not match yours:I'm flying within the United States.I have some form of expedited security: CLEAR, TSA PreCheck or the priority lane.I'm not checking bags.And there are some reasonable backups if I miss the flight, as is almost always the case since I mostly fly from New York to other major cities and have decent status on some of the big carriers.This won't give you much time to hang out — but it's enough of a buffer that you're very unlikely to miss your flight. There are more things that can add time to the baseline than subtract from it, however — so let's consider those complications.The commuteOf the flights that I missed, none were really because I didn't budget enough at the airport. Rather, all but one3 was because I misgauged my commute.As we all know, the estimated travel times that Uber or Lyft shows you are often optimistic. You're rarely going to be put in too much of a pickle in, say, Pittsburgh. But New York or Los Angeles is a different story. So as a default, I'd round up that commute time by 30 percent if there's a reasonable likelihood of encountering traffic. For a purported 30-minute commute, for instance, I'd budget 40 minutes instead. (The spreadsheet allows for a more detailed set of calculations.) One other tip: at most airports, the PM rush hour is usually worse than the AM. That's because they're usually located on the outskirts of town, so you'll be competing with commuters returning home to the suburbs from work.And don't forget to budget time to park or return a rental car if you need to: I'd add 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the circumstances, like that the LAX rental car facility might as well be located in San Diego.The basics once you arriveHow big and busy is the airport? My 60-minutes-before-arrival default is calibrated to a midsize airport like Chicago Midway or either of the Portlands. I'd add up to 15 minutes for the very busiest airports like JFK, DFW or O'Hare. There are just more things that can go wrong — and also at airports like JFK, it can physically take a long time to walk to the gate. (The spreadsheet version lets you choose from about 60 American airports; estimates of added time are based on a combination of my experience and guesstimates from OpenAI DeepResearch.)At big airports, you can round these times back down by 5 to 10 minutes if you're a frequent flier or know the airport well.4 And pretty much any traveler can shave off at least 5 minutes for small regional airports like Santa Barbara where you're already basically right at the gate the moment you pull up; this is almost impossible to screw up.My baseline also assumes that you're able-bodied. The spreadsheet lets you choose an option if you or someone in your party is slow-moving — say you have an 8-year-old with you or an 80-year-old — although you'll know more about those circumstances than I do.One subtle factor that I nearly got burned on recently: I'd add a buffer of 5 to 10 minutes if you have a connection to make. This might seem silly since it doesn't affect the departure time at the originating airport. But it raises the stakes for missing your flight. Also, if you arrive at the very last moment, you'll likely be asked to gate-check your bag, which can get you off to a slower start when making that tight connection.International travel The conventional wisdom is that you should arrive an hour earlier for international flights, and I don't think that's a bad heuristic. But this is a trickier question than you might assume. Most American airports don't even have dedicated international terminals: some of the joy of airports is that the flight to Auckland could be right across the corridor from the one to Oakland.The process of transiting from the airport doors to the gates is often superficially the same whether traveling domestically or abroad. In the U.S., you usually don't have to clear customs and passport control before an international flight. The exception is places that are subject to the CBP's Preclearance program, namely most destinations in Canada, the Caribbean, Ireland and the UAE. Preclearance is mostly a positive — it will save you time upon arrival — but you do need to budget for it when considering when to leave for the airport.So let's decompose this. What are the reasons you might want to arrive earlier for an international flight?Planes are usually bigger and boarding starts sooner, and is often a shitshow because you're sharing the gate with families and people speaking a million different languages.You'll often have to visit the check-in counter to verify your documents and get a boarding pass — and if not, they'll check your passport at the gate.Many international routes are flown at most a couple of times a day, so missing your flight is a huge inconvenience.To break it down more precisely:As a default, even if you think you're fully checked in, I'd add 20 to 40 minutes to your domestic flight baseline for international travel, depending on your general experience level with flying abroad.If you do need to visit the check-in counter, I'd add a further 15 minutes for business class and 30 minutes for coach.And if you need to clear immigration before you take off — remember, this is not true for most destinations, but the most common exception is Canada — I'd add another 30 minutes.If missing the flight would cause a huge inconvenience — your best friend annoyingly decided to hold a destination wedding in Buenos Aires, you're the best man and it's last flight of the day — you might add more time still. But this sort of situation can also apply for domestic flights, so we'll cover these cases later.Security and check-inThis is not an advertorial for TSA Pre or CLEAR, but I think if you do the math, you'll find that they're very much worth it if you value your time and fly with any frequency. It's not just that they reduce the average wait time — they also reduce variance, and variance is at least half the battle when timing airport arrivals. Some degree of redundancy can even help: recently I've found that the priority line is often faster than the CLEAR line.If I'm going through regular plain-vanilla security instead, I'll add an additional 20 minutes to my baseline. As of 2018, all but a small handful of airports were faster than this on average, and TSA wait times have steadily improved for the past decade or two. In the spreadsheet, I do recommend adding an extra 5 minutes for the airports that have historically had the slowest security (BWI, EWR, IAH, JFK, LAS and MIA) and subtracting 5 minutes for very small airports, but this is a moving target as security protocols and staffing levels often change. Keep in mind that I already have you budgeting a little extra time at the busiest airports on top of this.The circumstances when you're likely to encounter really long lines are fairly predictable: holidays like Thanksgiving when a lot of families are traveling — they're much slower than business commuters — or during bad weather when everything at the airport gets backed up. I'd add an additional 30 minutes for regular security or 15 minutes for expedited security during holiday peaks5 and the same amount for severe winter weather — these are additive, particularly given that the holidays often coincide with bad weather in most of the United States. Summer thunderstorms are less bad, since they can roll through quickly rather than delaying operations for days on end, but I'd add 20 minutes (for coach; 10 for priority security) during severe storms.Budgeting extra time during bad weather might seem superfluous, since your flight will often be delayed, too.6 But when there's a risk of severe delays or cancellations, it's generally worth it to be on the ground so you can find alternative options. If you do miss your flight, it might take days before there's another seat available.I never check bags unless I absolutely have to, since that slows you down on both ends of the connection. But if you do, budgeting more time is non-negotiable and indeed most airlines have a strictly-enforced 45-minute cutoff point for checking luggage. I'd add 20 minutes for this, rounding down to 15 minutes on a business-class ticket.Beyond checking bags, there's rarely a need to visit the customer service counter for a domestic flight, but these desks are often understaffed and full of customers troubleshooting edge-case issues, so I'd add extra time for that too. Lastly, I'd add 5 to 10 minutes, depending on your comfort level, if something in your check-in baggage routinely triggers the machines; TSA sometimes gives me a hard time when I'm bringing my fancy podcast mic along, for instance.Cost-benefit assessmentI haven't gotten to the most important part yet, the part that's often neglected in debates about optimal airport strategy. What are the consequences of missing your flight?I already covered the example when there's exactly one flight left to catch to make it on time for your best friend's wedding. There, you should be extremely risk-averse. The opposite case is what I encountered on my last trip to Chicago; my conference didn't begin until 10 the next morning, but I flew out in the mid-afternoon the previous day to get dinner with an old friend. This circumstance allows for a more aggressive strategy, if you wish. There are something like 70 flights per weekday from New York to Chicago. My friend would have forgiven me if we had to push back dinner, and I could even have flown out the next morning and still made my event.Really, though, there are two slightly distinct components of this question that interact with one another:How many viable alternative flights are there if you miss your original one?And just how bad are the consequences if you're substantially late?These have a multiplicative effect. If you have truly essential travel and there's exactly one flight that will get you there on time, I'd add a full extra hour (60 minutes) on top of all the other buffers you've created. This really should be enough; for international flights, many airlines don't even open their check-in counters until three hours before departure.Just having one or the other circumstance isn't so bad, however.7 The spreadsheet will let you work through various in-between combinations. Keep in mind that all of these are subjective estimates so you're welcome to use your own. But if you're cutting it at all close, it's always helpful to know how many other flights are on that route later in the day.8The last question: be honest, how much do you like hanging out at the airport? There's no shame in saying \"a lot\". Airports can offer an excuse to eat fast food9 or to drink at a weirdly-branded bar with strangers. In the spreadsheet, I add 20 minutes if you say you love airports — enough time for a quick bite or a beer — and subtract 5 minutes if you totally hate them. As airport amenities have improved, particularly with the redevelopment of the NYC-area airports, I'm finding I increasingly click on the +20 minutes option to give myself more breathing room.One last thing to consider. The worst-case scenario is if everything goes wrong: there's traffic and a long line at security and your flight as at the very last gate at the rump end of JFK Terminal 4. But statistically speaking, this is unlikely10, and the spreadsheet gives you an option to round down your buffer if there's an opportunity to make up for lost time.The spreadsheetHere's an example of how all this math adds up. Let's say you're flying from LaGuardia to Bangor, Maine, as I will be later this month. This is a fairly low-stakes trip, but let's say there are some downside factors: there aren't a lot of flights on this route, traffic can always be an issue in New York11, and your traveling companion is one of those incorrigible people who insists on checking luggage. The spreadsheet suggests that you should leave home at 7:50 a.m. for your 10 a.m. departure, budgeting 40 minutes for the commute (including a buffer for traffic) and leaving yourself 90 minutes at the airport.It's perhaps not the prettiest-looking spreadsheet — we're going with function over form — but I've played around with it a lot, and I think it spits out reasonable estimates to accommodate a wide variety of circumstances. It does not guarantee that you'll never miss a flight; how much risk you want to run is determined by the settings you choose under the cost-benefit section.12 But the point is, you ought to know a lot more about your circumstances than the TSA does. Here's wishing you a safe and efficient journey the next time you fly.Paid subscribers can find their copy of the spreadsheet below. Read more",

      "content": "fucking gorgeous coverTwo months from today, my first novel will be published by Coffee House Press. I'm very excited and very proud of the book. I've mentioned its origins before. Over the years I've been asked by many people to write a mental illness memoir, and in fact was told by someone at a major publishing house that he could get me quite a large advance for one, should I write one. But my story is not worth telling; real mental illness is not cinematic, and my real mental illness has been a monotonous and painfully boring slog, one that has ruined my life but in a slow, grinding way rather than a dramatic way. I could have written a memoir, could have gotten a big advance, and perhaps could even have completed the book without writing anything genuinely dishonest. But the attempt still would have been fundamentally disingenuous and contrary to my basic beliefs about psychiatric disorders. So I set out to use fiction to convey the reality of bipolar disorder, to stay grounded and real but using the allowances of fiction to present a story people would actually want to read. The result is The Mind Reels. More than anything, I just want you guys to read it. And, yeah, I want it to sell, obviously. I want Coffee House's faith in me to be rewarded, I want to maintain my opportunity to publish books, I want to be financially successful. Obviously. But I also think that this book has value as a depiction of a badly misunderstood disorder and of severe mental illness in general, which has recently been subject to endless distortion through media and politics. I think it stands as an example of an alternative to the endless romanticization of mental illness and to the refusal of our popular culture to depict such illness in all of its ugly, mundane pain and destruction. And, you know, I think it's good. It's a good book. So preorder it, read it when you get your hands on it, review it honestly on Goodreads or Amazon or Substack or wherever else, and have conversations about it. That's all I'll ever ask, honest engagement. And to entice you, if you aren't already enticed! I have posted an excerpt on my personal website. Please give that a read and see if it intrigues you. And now here's a part that is admittedly self-serving but also important. Yesterday I was looking around to see if there were any new reactions to the book out there. I have been doing that a lot, which I think is understandable given my excitement. This has always been one of the weird things about media: searching around for responses to your work is seen as somehow low status within the industry, which I find very odd given that I naturally care about my work and its reception. (It's also odd because media people tend to be exquisitely sensitive to their reputations among their peers; caring about being popular but not about being good is, I'm afraid, the norm.) I've always been interested in seeing what people have to say about my writing. I have no idea why that's seen as worthy of ridicule among people in media and frankly I don't care. So I popped the title in the BlueSky search bar and, surprise surprise, found media people lying about it.It started out with my old buddy Jonathan Katz, who's on the Good White Man list and has been periodically demonstrating how not-mad he is about it ever since. Katz had found something I had written on Substack Notes about how liberals had neutered their own ability to respond to Trump by monstering anyone who tried to engage in internal criticism. Standard stuff, you've heard it before, I certainly stand by all of it. I will tell you that I find that behavior pathetic - going onto a forum that someone else doesn't participate in to hold them up for mockery, borrowing on their preexisting lack of popularity to make yourself more popular. I will never understand such behavior among ostensible adults. You can mock it all you want, but when I have a problem with someone, I let them know directly. I send a lot of emails telling people when I disagree with something they've written or said. People in media love to make fun of that practice, but a hit dog will holler - they make fun of it because they're congenitally passive aggressive and don't like real, adult conflict. So I told Katz how I felt. But ultimately, who cares about a random Substack note, right. What I do care about is misrepresenting a book that's not available for readers to evaluate yet.So this is just flat-out dishonest. There is no facet of the main character's life that is more clearly established in the beginning of the book than her fundamental ordinariness and her acceptance of it; that is core to everything I am trying to do, narratively and thematically. Here's a quote:She was the opposite of an unrealized genius; everyone was modestly satisfied by her performance, and not a single soul ever talked about her greater potential, not even her parents. She floated up to the level of B+ advanced mediocrity she was destined to reach, and no higher. In all things she put her head down and marched unwaveringly into the unexceptional spaces every one had predicted she would occupy.That's literally on the third page.It's such a weird thing to lie about. I'm quite sure that the person in question was just trying to mimic Katz in borrowing my preexisting lack of popularity among the lib journo set. And she seems young, and this kind of behavior is deeply enculturated in media professional circles, and it's a profession full of immensely insecure people, so I'm inclined to be forgiving. But, you know, when someone asks a question about a book that you've said you're reading, and you give a flatly wrong answer, and it's pointed out to you that it's wrong, the thing to do is to say \"Sorry, I was wrong.\" Instead she complained that she hasn't read the book yet. But if that's true... why are you answering Katz's question like you know the answer? And, for the record, I of course didn't write the marketing copy she quoted contemptuously. How do all of these writers not know this stuff?So then she pulled out a couple of quotes from Pamela Paul and Andrew Sullivan that Coffee House had provided in its marketing materials and acted like they were quotes about the novel. Katz followed suit, as did a bunch of other liberal journos who were eager to get in on the fun. Had they bothered to look at the marketing materials that she linked to, they would have seen that these quotes had nothing to do with the novel; they were quotes from Paul and Sullivan about my writing in general, which Coffee House had pulled as part of marketing, a perfectly ordinary part of the promotion process. So far as I know, neither Paul nor Sullivan has read the novel. To be clear, I would have no problem with sharing their opinions on the novel if they had them to share; I don't have any ideological purity tests that I require people to pass before they read or praise my work. (And, for the record, Paul's reign over the Books section of the NYT was best that section has been in my decades of reading the paper.) But the two actual blurbs, as in from people who have read the book, are from novelists, Adelle Waldman and Andrew Martin. Again, it's right there in black and white. Why lie like this? It's so bizarre.It should go without saying that your integrity is most apparent not when it comes to treating people you like well but when it comes to treating people you dislike well, when you insist on being honest about people who are unpopular just as you would insist on being honest about people who are popular. Basic stuff. Basic adult integrity stuff. Basic character stuff.Katz's fixation on me is not the issue. He's clearly been badly stung by my criticisms of him and I suspect that he's an insecure person in general, hence this periodic effort of his to hang me up for ridicule on BlueSky, a network tailor-made for anxious liberals to theatrically laugh at things they're scared of. What is the issue is this tendency for people in my industry to say things about me or my work that simply are not true, and to be utterly unreachable when it comes to asking them for basic accountability. What are a bunch of adults doing, going on social media to \"own\" people and then refusing to admit when they've perpetuated a lie in doing so? I just don't understand grownups who behave this way. All you have to do is say \"you're right, I was just going with the crowd and said something that wasn't true, my bad.\" That's all it takes - \"my bad.\"I will again ask the rhetorical question I've asked many times: do people not have an exit strategy from acting like this? From doing Twitter as they slouch into middle age? From acting like middle school students online? Is speaking in tired memes in an effort to get complete strangers to briefly offer their approval not inherently a behavior you should age out of? What is it gonna take, exactly, for people to leave this plainly childish set of behaviors behind?People always respond to this sort of thing by saying that I should just ignore it, that you can't engage, that it makes you look worse if you push back.... And my whole career has demonstrated how misguided that thinking is. Not pushing back just lets people get away with it, and I'm quite sure that the absolute lack of any consistent standards of basic honesty in media culture stems in part from the fact that it's considered embarrassing to fight back. So I fight back. And, look, this stuff has consequences. Like six weeks back I saw someone online mentioning that they were excited for my book, and then someone else immediately popping up to say that they shouldn't read it or praise it, because I'm transphobic. As readers here know, I have been arguing in favor of trans rights for my entire adult life, including support for trans people's right to use the bathroom consistent with their gender identity, the right of trans children and their parents and doctors to make their own decisions regarding gender medicine, and the basic fairness of allowing trans athletes to participate in youth sports. The idea that I have transphobic views is just a lie, advanced by people who want to disqualify me and who don't care about bending the truth to do so. And I've paid a price for holding the views I do, as anyone would in this business.I don't want people to lie about my views on trans rights, or abortion, or Palestine, or immigration, or anything else because the truth is important, and also because I don't want people who don't know better to be hurt by the lies, and yes, because I don't want to suffer career consequences based on views I've never held. Call me crazy! What I can tell you is that the disaffected, \"why do you care dude\" attitude that suggests that I should just roll over to this shit instead of pushing back has done nothing for me throughout a nearly twenty-year career of controversy. You don't push back, and this shit just festers, and people like Katz go on lying in an effort to get internet strangers to like them. That's how you get the absolutely bizarre massive Twitter meltdown that happened in 2018, where hundreds of people reacted to the supposedly racist content of my first book - which I had not written yet. You constantly roll over and do the too-cool-for-school thing with this stuff, and that's how you get a culture where dozens of people were lying about my novel yesterday and then mocking me for saying that, actually, lying is bad. No, fuck that. You have to stick up for yourself.What I can tell you for sure is that, if Katz has written any novels, I won't be commenting on them because I haven't read them, and if I were to read them, I would share my honest opinion about how good or bad they are regardless of his supreme lack of affection for me. I've done that before, many times, praise people who see me as their enemy, defend people who dislike me personally, stick up for people who have told lies about me. It would be an insult to my own dignity to not be honest when it came to people who haven't treated me very well. For example, Nathan Robinson is someone who has tried to unperson me in the industry, including by spreading the transphobia lie, and yet I've public praised his socialism primer multiple times in multiple venues. Because I really believe in this shit, you know? I believe in books and ideas and argument and all that stuff. The reality is that there isn't much book media left, which means that every little petty bit of bias that my novel encounters will be amplified. It's bad enough to be a consistent critic of liberalism trying to publish fiction; books media is so dominated by liberal Democrats that it makes Fox News look like a world of great ideological diversity. Will the New York Times cover the book? I don't know. I recently publicly complained about their bad labor practices with freelancers, which you rarely see; to be clear, freelancers constantly complain about the labor practices of the New York Times, they just don't do so publicly because they can't risk losing the opportunity to write there. Well, despite all of my cynicism towards the paper, I trust its various firewalls and the integrity of its people not to influence whether or how they cover the book. But that's the institution; within the actual big unwieldy ship that is the NYT, it would probably be easy for any given staffer to keep the book off of whatever list. Will New York cover the book, despite the antipathy that exists towards me in that building? I doubt it, but I'm holding out hope, even if they do their usual thing and hand it to Andrea Long Chu and say \"savage this,\" which consistently produces work that's celebrated by the liberals she has such explicit disdain for. Would the New Yorker books desk bother to put down their martini glasses long enough to read my novel? Hard to say. But my reputation doesn't help, and it also shouldn't matter.So: once again, it's up to all of you. I'm gonna be swimming against the tide with this novel in every way imaginable, all of the biases of what's left of establishment media. That's why I need the help of readers like you. And, yes, it's of course self-serving of me to say that. But it's also true. The book deserves to be read and evaluated and reviewed on its own merits, and I'm afraid that I have little faith in the institutional integrity of this industry, especially given how little there remains that still covers fiction. So I'm counting on all of you to help me make The Mind Reels a success. Read the excerpt, if you're inclined. Preorder it at the bookseller of your choice if you haven't, ask your local library to carry it, review it on Goodreads or Amazon when you've gotten a chance to read it, discuss it on social media, and spread the word.

Some genetic variants can, for instance, increase a person’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes when inherited from the father, but lower it when inherited from the mother. But such effects have been challenging to unpick owing to gaps in genomic data. A study published in Nature this week describes a statistical method used to identify at least 30 parent-of-origin effects1 in 14 genes. When a child is conceived, it inherits two copies of almost every gene — one from each parent — and both are generally turned either on or off. But in some regions of the genome, one copy can be turned on, or expressed, while the other is silenced. This can lead to ‘imprinting’ disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome, which is usually caused by a missing or non-functional paternal copy of the UBE3A gene on chromosome 15. In contrast, a missing or non-functional maternal copy can cause Angelman syndrome. More here. Enjoying the content on 3QD? Help keep us going by donating now.",

      "content": "Industrial improvement systems — strategies for making a business more profitable, more efficient, or better operated — rise and fall in popularity over time. Today, the most widely known improvement systems are probably various flavors of \"Lean methods,\" the adaptation of the Toyota Production System first made popular by the 1990 book The Machine that Changed the World. But go back to the 1950s, and efficiency experts will instead tout the benefits of \"work simplification,\" a collection of strategies for streamlining production processes and eliminating wasteful or unnecessary steps. (Work simplification is still occasionally recommended as a method of process improvement today, including by the consultant with the unfortunate website URL www.worksimp.com.) Go even farther back to the turn of the century, and the dominant improvement strategy will now be Frederick Taylor's scientific management.1Frequency that different industrial improvement systems are mentioned in books via Google Ngram Viewer.One lesser known industrial improvement system that appeared and then receded in the second half of the 20th century is Group Technology. Group Technology first arose in the Soviet Union, and shares many similarities with Lean methods. But its popularity peaked in the 1980s, and today it seems mostly forgotten. It's interesting to try and understand what made it seem compelling, and why it ultimately lost favor.Frequency that different industrial improvement systems are mentioned in books via Google Ngram Viewer.Premise of Group TechnologyGroup Technology is an improvement system designed to apply to factories, machine shops, or other production operations that produce a wide variety of different parts in relatively small numbers. Unlike mass production, which can use dedicated production lines to produce large volumes of identical or near-identical goods, equipment in these high-mix, low-volume operations will be used to produce a variety of different parts or components depending on the day. A machine might be used for Part A today, Part B tomorrow, Part C the next day, and so on.The basic idea behind Group Technology is that many of the parts and components produced in these sorts of operations will share similarities. A machine shop might make 50 different types of steel bolt, depending on the exact product or the customer's order, but while the sizes and shapes of the bolts might differ, they'll likely all use similar materials and require the same sort of operations done in roughly the same order. These similarities can be exploited to make production operations more efficient. In Group Technology, similar parts made from similar materials and that require similar operations are grouped together (hence the name), and produced in manufacturing cells dedicated to those types of parts. These cells contain the exact machines needed, arranged in the order that they're needed and configured to do the sorts of jobs that the parts require.Types of factory layout, via \"The Introduction of Group Technology\".This arrangement yields several benefits:Movement and travel times are reduced. Parts don't need to be routed all over the factory, but move quickly through a series of machines dedicated to particular groups.Setup times are reduced. Machines can be configured to quickly perform the sorts of operations a particular group of parts or components requires.Work in process and cycle times are reduced. With less movement and setup time, products get routed through the necessary steps much more quickly, resulting in less inventory piling up and products getting to the customer much faster. Short cycle times allow for material to be ordered frequently in smaller batches, paced to the level of demand, making it easier to flexibly respond to market changes.Capital costs are reduced. Less work in process means smaller factories are required, and reduced setup times results in greater equipment utilization, squeezing more output from a given amount of equipment.More generally, Group Technology aims to achieve many of the benefits of mass production in a high-mix, low-volume production operation.A brief history of Group TechnologyThe basic ideas behind Group Technology — creating dedicated production areas for similar sorts of parts — began to emerge in the early 20th century in the wake of mass production, assembly line methods.2 In 1925, American engineer RE Flanders described a method of production control which emphasized \"standardization of product, departmentalization by product rather than process, minimized transportation, visual control of work itself instead of remote control by records.'\" In 1938, JC Kerr, another American engineer, described grouping machine tools together to \"smooth the flow of production as it does in a one-product shop.\" And in 1949, Swedish engineer Arn Corling described the reorganization of a Swedish bus manufacturer around principles of what he called \"group production\":He wrote that group production was an adaptation of line production to the machine shops working on batch production and that \"this implies radical decentralisation into small independent production units or groups, each comprising the machines and everything needed for the complete manufacture of a special category of parts.\"But it was the Soviet Union where Group Technology as a holistic system of improvement truly emerged. In 1937 Soviet professor AP Sokolovskiy suggested that \"parts of similar configuration and features should be manufactured by standard processes, thus making it possible to introduce flow line into batch production.\" In 1952, Soviet engineer SP Mitrofanov published a monograph on using ideas of group production on turret lathes, and began consulting with other factories on how the ideas could be adopted. Thanks to Mitrofanov's efforts (he published four books on what he began to call Gruppovaya Tekhnoiogiya, or Group Technology, between 1955 and 1959), Group Technology began to gain traction in the USSR. Mitrofanov was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1959, and Group Technology was recommended by the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Group Technology became \"one of the fashionable new technologies,\" and it was discussed frequently in seminars and talks. By the early 1960s, Group Technology was being used in hundreds of Soviet factories.As it spread in the Soviet Union, Group Technology also began to take root in Europe and the US. This seems to have been partly due to broader interest in codification and classification systems that were being developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and partly due to Mitrov's book The Scientific Principles of Group Technology being translated into English in 1966. A conference on Group Technology was held in London in 1961, and it was discussed at a series of international conferences on classification and coding that were held in the 1960s. By the 1970s, there were at least half a dozen books published in English that touted the benefits of Group Technology, and companies like Boeing had adopted the methods in at least some form.Boeing's Group Technology-based BUCCS part classification system.The peak of Group Technology's popularity seems to have been the 1980s.3 Up through the end of the decade, it continued to be the subject of dedicated books, and merit substantial mentions in books on adjacent subjects (such as just-in-time and flexible manufacturing systems). But interest in the system seems to have rapidly fallen off in the 1990s.One industry that did, and (as far as I'm aware, still does) enthusiastically adopt Group Technology is shipbuilding. Modern texts on shipbuilding, such as Storch's Ship Production, still make extensive reference to Group Technology as the system used to divide up work on a ship and in a shipyard. However, it's not 100% clear to me when this \"adoption\" actually took place. From what I can see, it wasn't until the late 1970s, when the US began studying modern shipbuilding methods in countries like Japan via the National Shipbuilding Research Program, that the label of Group Technology began to be applied. Researchers then retroactively described these methods as \"working off the logic of Group Technology.\"Why interest in Group Technology wanedIt's not 100% clear why interest fell in Group Technology, but I have some suspicions. Many of the valuable aspects of Group Technology — using manufacturing cells, reducing work in process and cycle times, eliminating wasteful part movements, decreasing setup times, increasing machine utilization — weren't unique to group technology, but were similarly advocated by other industrial improvement systems like Lean methods and the Theory of Constraints. (Those familiar with Lean methods will note how similar the advertised benefits of Group Technology are to Lean.) And other systems often bundled these benefits into a much sexier package. Lean methods were spread by The Machine that Changed the World, a popularization of Womack and Jones' academic research on the Japanese Auto industry, which sold in enormous numbers, like The Goal. Both of these books encapsulate their recommendations into an easily digestible format.Group Technology part codification system, via \"Group Technology: Foundation for Competitive Manufacturing\"By contrast, what's notable to me when reading about Group Technology is how much emphasis is immediately placed on the tedious process of part coding and classification. It often seems like developing a part coding scheme and the necessary documentation (which might entail creating thousands of new part drawings) is the main thing Group Technology efforts end up focusing on. A 1989 survey of US Group Technology users, for instance, extensively discusses the codification schemes and issues with implementing them, but makes no mention of any benefits achieved in terms of reduction of part movement, setup or cycle times, or machine efficiency (the only benefits discussed relate to part design and process planning). Often this codification seems to have involved buying some off the shelf codification system (along with implementation software), and then adapting it to the needs of the specific business.Given how much emphasis it places on doing tedious paperwork and software configuration, it's not surprising to me that there were no breakout Group Technology hits like The Goal or The Machine That Changed The World, or that systems that repackaged many of Group Technology's basic ideas, without the immense emphasis on paperwork, became more successful.1Scientific management isn't shown on this graph, but its early 20th century peak is much higher than any subsequent peaks, and even following its decline it still has more frequent mentions than any other system. I suspect this is due to interest as a subject of historical study. 2It was likely the adoption of electricity, which allowed machine tools to have their own dedicated electric motors, which made Group Technology possible. Prior to dedicated electric motors, machines were driven by belts connected to overhead drive shafts, which limited flexibility in machine arrangement. Giving each machine its own motor removed this constraint. (industrial innovation in the soviet union 106).3In general, the 1980s seem to have been a period of high demand for industrial improvement systems, possibly due to falling US competitiveness compared to foreign countries like Japan. In addition to books on Group Technology appearing that decade, Goldratt published The Goal, his bestselling business novel describing the Theory of Constraints. The 1980s is also when interest in Japanese manufacturing techniques really began to take off.",

We had been assured that Trump had pivoted away from his love of Putin and now was on Ukraine's side. We were told that this was the moment when Trump would finally hammer Russia. We were confidently assured that we were about to see crippling, secondary sanctions placed on states doing business with Russia, sanctions that would make it impossible for those states to do business with Putin's war machine.Putin and Witkoff Meeting in Moscow Yesterday: Maybe They Are Laughing Because They Are Discussing Trump's Pivot to Ukraine.I mean, how could this not happen? Trump was making some even stronger statements about how angry he was with Putin, how the Russians had been deceiving him how he could no longer believe them. He had upped his threats and was now talking about super duper tariffs on Russia. First they were going to come in 50 days after July 14, a deadline he later moved up to this week!And the media and foreign policy experts, either terminally stupid or wilfully misguided kept telling us repeatedly that Trump had really changed—that he was now in Ukraine's corner against Russia. The Financial Times spoke about Trump's apparent \"pivot\" to Ukraine—claiming that the president had had an \"epiphany\" in his view of the war. Supporters of Ukraine in Congress were so supposedly emboldened by Trump's dramatic change of heart that they were about to press head with masses of new aid for Ukraine and devastating sanctions on Russia. These sanctions, we were told by some Republicans, were going to be so \"crippling\" that they would soon have Putin begging for mercy.And foreign policy experts were also convinced of this. Condoleeza Rice assured us that Trump had now switched to backing Ukraine and understood what Putin wanted, and that was now a \"turning point\" in the war.The chorus was deafening until yesterday—when once again Trump stepped in and protected Putin from any real economic damage, punting a decision at least three weeks down from the road, started waxing rhapsodical about dealing with the Russian dictator—and at the same time maneuvering the Ukrainians into a really dangerous position.What Trump Has Done Will Not Hurt Putin At All Read more",

This may sound strange: an ideal reader should refrain from crossing the boundary between a writer’s work and his life. And yet it is inevitable: rarely does an author have the luxury of having no known biography. Greene, having written about his life and having had his life extensively written about by others, remains near when one reads his work—not insistently dominating or distracting, as some writers may prove to be, but as a presence often felt and at times caught by a side glance. The first moment appears in Greene’s memoir Ways of Escape. In a chapter about Brighton Rock, which Greene called a labour of love, he explains the original inspiration for the novel with a reminiscence about the first film he saw at age six—a silent film about a kitchen maid turned queen, with live music played offscreen—he writes, “Her march was accompanied by an old lady on a piano, but the tock-tock-tock of untuned wires stayed in my memory when other melodies faded … That was the kind of book I always wanted to write: the high romantic tale, capturing us in youth with hopes that prove illusions, to which we return again in age in order to escape the sad reality.” more here.

      "content": "This essay originally appeared in Judean People's Front in April 2025.On the morning of October 8th, my dad sent a text to our family group chat:Kids. I never emphasized our Jewish identity, not until today. Jews are not always right, but millennium after millennium, they followed the light and their convictions. I want you to be proud of who you are, and remember that you are part of a small group of people who left a big mark on the world. And, no matter what you hear, have faith in thousands of years of tradition.On the morning of October 8th, I was puzzled. Israel had just seen the largest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. The world was still reeling from the aftermath of the brutal Hamas attacks that even Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez begrudgingly acknowledged, and, naively, I expected the world to be on Israel's side. What was my dad on about with this cryptic text, this \"no matter what you hear\" paranoia?My dad, a former citizen of the USSR, saw it coming. In less than 24 hours after the Hamas attacks, the media began to blame the Jews.It is no secret that the Jews have been subject to profound historical discrimination. From blood libel to the Dreyfus affair, we have suffered more acutely than perhaps any other ethnoreligious group on the planet. And, aside from the Holocaust, the most egregious incidence of antisemitism in recent history occurred in the Soviet Union.The Bolshevik Revolution initially promised emancipation to Jews facing persecution under Tsarist Russia, but widespread support of the Revolution among Jewish families waned as Jews quickly became second-class Soviet citizens. On Soviet passports, for instance, Jews were identified by ethnicity rather than nationality and forced to disclose their Jewish identity, which frequently set them up to be thwarted by employment quotas and other instances of workplace discrimination. Joseph Stalin's infamous yet somewhat nebulous Doctor's Plot accused a handful of Jewish doctors of attempting to poison Soviet authorities, giving an eerie new life to the \"Jews as poisoners\" narrative of the medieval era. My own family suffered through three generations of anti-Jewish discrimination: my great-grandfather was beaten to death by the KGB after being framed for stealing government money, my grandfather was barred from holding certain positions in the Soviet army despite his military prowess, and my father was wrongfully imprisoned after being accused of fraud by a group of antisemitic officials.In the 1980s, a new wave of antisemitism swept through the country, inciting a mass wave of Soviet-Jewish emigration to both Israel and America. My own parents fled to America during this particular exodus, and other members of my extended family settled in Israel. Because of my family's trauma in the Soviet Union, I was not raised explicitly Jewish, but the values my parents and grandparents passed on to me—resilience, optimism, and faith in tradition—are directly informed by the Russian-Jewish legacy. As a first-generation American, I have been lucky enough to meet a diverse group of Russian-speaking Jews, each coming from unique circumstances and backgrounds, yet each caring poignantly about the Jewish tradition.Because Russian Jews are often united by shared experience and resilience in the face of an oppressive system, they typically have three things in common: faith in meritocracy, an aversion to socialist practices, and a discerning empathy for the Jewish people and their traditions. The Soviet Union's systemic failures—famines, economic stagnation, political purges, and Jewish cultural erasure—left an indelible mark on the Russian-Jewish psyche, and for those lucky enough to escape to the West, an economic system that rewarded hard work, innovation, and individual freedom was not an abstract concept but a lifeline. Given the Russian-Jewish skepticism of utopian promises and collectivist ideologies, the luxury of freedom—specifically with respect to free-market capitalism and freedom of religion—became a cornerstone of the Russian-Jewish worldview. Taken together, these values might be categorized today under a conservative or libertarian umbrella, though they have little overlap with the values of, say, rural Trump voters. The Russian-Jewish mindset emphasizes freedom and a special commitment to tradition. It is no accident that the world's most famous libertarian thinker—Ayn Rand—was a Russian Jew.This commitment to freedom and tradition led Russian Jews to develop staunch Zionist convictions. Today, nearly 15% of Israel's population is composed of Russian Jews who fled from the Soviet Union. As the symbol of Jewish safety and actualization, Israel is dear to Russian Jews—both those who call the country home and those who admire it from abroad. Because of their experiences with antisemitism, Russian Jews like my dad were keenly affected by the atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7th and see Israel's retaliation against a terrorist-ruled Palestine as fully justified. Indeed, the Jewish people—persecuted for centuries—have every right to defend themselves against a future terrorist attack and must do everything it takes to eliminate the hostile force of Hamas in order to forge long-lasting peace in the Middle East. Given everything we have lived through, I do not see this as a radically backwards view—it is, in fact, necessary if we are to build a brighter future.So in the wake of October 7th, I was shocked and disheartened to learn that one of Israel's most vocal opponents was a Russian Jew.In December 2023, just two months after the attacks of October 7th, Masha Gessen, a trans and non-binary journalist of Russian-Jewish descent who has recently adopted the moniker \"M,\" published a piece in The New Yorker called \"In the Shadow of the Holocaust.\" In the past, Gessen has used her background to position herself as an opponent of authoritarianism and has often levied rightful criticism on Vladimir Putin's authoritarian Russia. In more recent years, however, Gessen has sacrificed her more nuanced, discerning eye to ally herself with the woke left, critiquing the institution of marriage and adopting a non-standard identity. This radical shift leftward has also led her to embrace the post-October-7th wave of antisemitism coming from the left: despite having family members who lived through both the Holocaust and the antisemitic purges in Soviet Russia, Gessen believes that Israel, a supposed apartheid state, is to blame for October 7th.\"In the Shadow of the Holocaust\" is a heartbreaking read for any Jew whose family has suffered through the Holocaust or lived through any sort of antisemitism. While Gessen's entire essay is predicated on a variation of Norman Finkelstein's \"Holocaust Industry\"—the disturbingly antisemitic assertion that Jews exploit the memory of the Holocaust for political and financial gain—Gessen's most egregious claim in the piece is that the IDF response to Hamas mirrors the Nazi persecution of Jews during World War II. By likening Gaza to a Nazi ghetto, Gessen engages in a rhetorical sleight of hand that falsely equates a nation defending itself against terrorism with a truly genocidal, bloodthirsty regime; such a comparison not only trivializes the unique horrors of the Holocaust but also ignores Hamas's role as a terrorist organization that deliberately endangers Palestinian civilians. It is unclear why Gessen would peddle such an antisemitic narrative—though she likely stands to gain financially from the ideologues over at The New Yorker—but what is clearly apparent is that Gessen's framework not only erases the complexity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but also portrays the Jewish state as a perpetrator of the very atrocities it was founded to prevent.Gessen didn't stop there. Several months later, she was back with another antisemitic—and, this time, anti-feminist—Saturday morning New Yorker exposé. At first glance, her clunky title \"What We Know About the Weaponization of Sexual Violence on October 7th\" might appear to belong to a piece that condemns Hamas's use of sexual violence against innocent Jewish women. Instead, Gessen launches into a diatribe against the Israeli government and accuses the State of Israel of fabricating rape allegations and exaggerating the atrocities of October 7th for political purposes. The irony of a supposed intersectional feminist demanding additional verification of Hamas's sexual violence despite overwhelming testimony from survivors and documented evidence from human rights organizations has, of course, been pointed out on countless occassions—that does not stop Gessen from attempting to downplay the atrocities of October 7th in order to advance her political narrative. By framing these acts of violence as potential tools of propaganda, Gessen shifts the focus away from the perpetrators and further fuels a narrative that delegitimizes Israel's justified response to the October 7th attacks.Gessen pushes her antisemitic framework in the academic sphere as well. Writing for The New York Times about an incident at Brooklyn College where Jewish organizations lobbied to cancel a pro-Palestinian event, Gessen criticizes university administrators for shutting down \"nuanced\" perspectives on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and frames the event cancellation as an infringement of free speech. What Gessen does not mention is that such events often contribute to the rise of antisemitic fervor at American universities—the very same fervor that, masquerading as \"anti-Zionism,\" led to the wave of pro-Palestinian encampments on college campuses across the United States. Gessen is dismissive of Jewish student safety, adopting a snide tone in her remark that \"some Jewish students complained that the off-campus protests made them feel unsafe.\" Instead, she embraces the pro-Palestinian cause, lamenting the dismissal of university administrators who refused to condemn violence against Jewish students in a December 2023 congressional hearing and framing their testimonies as \"nuanced\" and \"respectful.\" And as Jewish students across the country feel increasingly unsafe on college campuses, Gessen's defense of such \"nuanced\" positions ignores the very real harm caused by this rhetoric, effectively dismissing the fears and experiences of Jewish students who are increasingly isolated in academic spaces.Despite her fascination with supposedly nuanced voices, Gessen herself does not have one. Whatever her motivations may be for turning a blind eye to the suffering of the Jewish people, by adopting and amplifying narratives that undermine the Jewish state, trivialize Jewish suffering, and embolden antisemitic voices, Gessen betrays not only the values of her heritage but also the convictions that have defined the Russian-Jewish experience for generations.Today, I think back to my dad's words—I want you to be proud of who you are—and wonder where Gessen would be today if she had had someone similar to tell her to be proud of her Jewish identity. Maybe she would be compelled to reconsider.Enjoyed this post? You can Buy Me a Coffee so that I'll be awake for the next one.

      "content": "On Tuesday Donald Trump went on CNBC to explain why the European Union is facing a tariff of \"only\" 15 percent. But what he said was simply delusional — and the delusion should be even more concerning than the tariffs.The Europeans, Trump asserted, had agreed to cough up $600 billion, which he described as a \"gift,\" not a loan. And he emphasized that this is \"$600 billion to invest in anything I want. Anything. I can do anything I want with it.\"So Trump apparently believes that the European Union has agreed to provide him with a personal $600 billion slush fund.In fact, as I pointed out after the \"deal\" was announced, the EU agreed to no such thing. In fact, it literally couldn't have made such an agreement. European nations aren't command economies in which government can tell the private sector where to invest, and in any case the European Commission, which negotiated with Trump, can't tell the governments of member states what to do.So think of it as the emperor's new trade deal: Trump is strutting around, feeling very impressed with himself, but in substantive terms he's stark naked.Does it matter? I've seen some commentary to the effect that it doesn't. Hey, it's just another Trumpian self-aggrandizing fantasy, like his belief that we have zero inflation, he has a 71 percent approval rating and \"people love the tariffs.\"But I don't think we should feel reassured about Trump's trade delusions because he's lost touch with reality across the board.What will happen if and when Trump realizes that Europe hasn't actually promised what he thinks it has — or, as he's likely to see it, that the EU has gone back on its promise? He's already given us an answer: He's going to put the tariff on Europe back up to 35 percent.He may not be able to carry out that threat. In fact, there's a very real possibility that the courts will rule many of the tariffs Trump has already imposed illegal (which they surely are) and order the administration to refund the money it has already collected.But assume that the Supreme Court does its usual thing and decides that the Constitution allows Trump to do whatever he wants. How afraid should Europe be of the possibility that Trump will put the tariffs back up, higher than before?Well, I've been trying to do the math, and as far as I can tell putting U.S. tariffs up from 15 to 35 percent would do less damage to Europe than many people imagine. Yes, it would hurt, but not all that much. By making a 15 percent tariff the baseline — what countries pay even if they do make \"deals\" — Trump has used up a lot of his trade war ammunition, greatly reducing the effectiveness of any further threats.After all, Europe has never been all that dependent on access to U.S. markets. In 2024 the EU's exports of goods to the United States were slightly less than 3 percent of its GDP — not a trivial sum, but not enough to make European prosperity dependent on U.S. goodwill.Trump's tariffs will make the EU even less dependent on the U.S. market. In Sunday's primer I explained that the crucial number is the \"Armington elasticity,\" which measures how sensitive trade flows are to tariffs, and that a reasonable estimate of that elasticity is 3. If we go with that number, we would expect the 15 percent tariff currently in place to cut EU exports to America by roughly a third, to around 2 percent of GDP.That's a palpable hit, but not a huge one. Writing in the Financial Times, Richard Milne tells us that reports from European companies are showing surprising resilience. Furthermore, the loss of U.S. business will be partially offset by higher government expenditure in Europe, with Germany in particular boosting spending on both infrastructure and defense.That's with a 15 percent tariff. But what happens if Trump pushes tariffs up to 35 percent? My back-of-the envelope calculations say that this would reduce Europe's exports to the United States by another 0.7 percent of GDP. That is, the hit to Europe if Trump makes good on his threats would be smaller than the hit he has already imposed with the tariffs he plans to keep in place regardless.This makes sense if you think about it. The higher the tariffs Trump imposes on imports, the less other countries sell to America. And the less they sell to us, the less they have to lose if we push the tariffs even higher.And that argument doesn't even take into account the strong possibility that another round of Trump tariffs would provoke retaliation from Europe and other trading partners. The EU has so far chosen not to retaliate against Trump's tariffs because its officials decided that making a deal, or at least seeming to make a deal, was better than getting into a tit-for-tat trade war. But if it turns out that Trump sees a deal not as the end of the story but simply as the jumping-off point for new demands, I suspect that even the timid bureaucrats in Brussels will eventually decide that enough is enough.But again, at this point the math of the trade war matters less than the madness that lies behind it.There has always been a whiff of megalomania about Trump's tariff policy — a belief that he can use the threat of tariffs to compel other countries to do his bidding on multiple fronts, from promising not to move away from the dollar as a reserve currency to abandoning the prosecution of wannabe dictators who tried to overthrow democracy.However, by making 15 percent tariffs the new normal — by keeping tariffs high even when countries make, or pretend to make, concessions to the United States — Trump has used up much of whatever trade ammunition he had.However, Trump will be the last person to recognize that there are limits to his ability to bully the world, on trade or anything else. And that lack of awareness should worry us all.MUSICAL CODA",

      "content": "Democracy, by Midjourney.These days there is a large volume of writings, podcasts, and what not being put out concerning the general concept of democracy, particularly in the United States, where it is (allegedly) in peril. Perhaps we need to step back a little and briefly explore what democracy is, how it evolved over time, and how it is practiced today, on the assumption that it's always a good idea to gain some knowledge concerning whatever we are talking about before we step on our soapbox and start making more or less grand pronouncements.What it isTo begin with, then, democracy is a system of government where political power ultimately derives from the people, who participate in decision-making either directly or through elected representatives. The core principle, then, is popular sovereignty—the idea that legitimate authority comes from the consent of the governed rather than from divine right, hereditary privilege, or force. In democratic countries, citizens have the right to participate in choosing their leaders and influencing policy decisions.Thus understood, democracy is characterized by a number of key elements, which usually include the notion of political equality, whereby all citizens have equal voting rights and opportunities to participate, regardless of wealth, social status, or other characteristics. Often, but not always, majority rule is accompanied by minority rights, meaning that decisions are made based on what most people want, but certain fundamental rights of minorities are protected from the potential tyranny of the majority.A democracy cannot be functional unless there are competitive elections, that is regular, free, and fair elections where multiple candidates or parties can compete for power. In the United States, for instance, the problem is that the Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that essentially unlimited amount of money can flow from private interest to election campaigns, thus severely undermining the notion of fair elections in the country and opening the floodgates to further corruption of the arguably already severely corrupted American electoral system.It also makes no sense to talk about democracy unless there is a rule of law, so that everyone—including leaders—is subject to it. Again, the US has recently taken a turn for the worse, because the Supreme Court in 2024 did away with the \"including leaders\" clause as far as the President of the nation is concerned, thus undermining a major component of American democracy. (See timeline at the end of the article for more specifics concerning the US.)A modern democracy typically also guarantees a certain number of civil liberties, including protection of basic freedoms like speech, assembly, and press, that enable meaningful political participation. Of course, what additional liberties are to be protected has been controversial in a number of countries, and this kind of discussion is very much central to the vitality and future of any democracy.A bit of historyDemocracy is largely, though not exclusively, a western concept, so there you have it, another thing to either blame or praise \"the West\" for. A quick historical survey shows that the earliest democracies in the world where the Roman Republic (founded in 509 BCE) and the Athenian one (founded a year later, in 508 BCE).The two systems had fundamentally different approaches to democratic governance. Athens practiced direct democracy, where eligible citizens participated directly in the Assembly (Ecclesia), voting on laws and policies themselves. However, citizenship was notoriously limited—only free adult males born in Athens qualified, excluding women, slaves, and foreigners, who together made up most of the population. Rome, by contrast, was a representative republic where citizens elected officials to govern on their behalf. Roman citizenship was broader and more flexible, eventually extending to conquered peoples and allies, though it had different tiers with varying rights.Although we often hear that democracy was born in Athens, this is not exactly the case either temporally or, more importantly, in terms of structure, since modern democratic states resemble the Roman Republic much more than ancient Athens. Moreover, the Athenian democracy was relatively short-lived (roughly 508-322 BCE) and geographically limited to the city-state of Athens and its immediate territory, while the Roman Republic lasted much longer (509-27 BCE) and applied to a vast territory, requiring more sophisticated administrative systems and accommodating diverse populations.I'm not a historian, and certainly not an expert on the evolution of democracy, so take the following with a grain of salt. After the Roman and Athenian experiments, history does register a number of others. In rough chronological order we begin with the Venetian Republic (697-1797 CE), which had an elaborate electoral system for selecting the Doge (leader) and council members, though voting was limited to certain patrician families. The Icelandic Althing was established in 930 CE and is considered one of the world's oldest parliamentary bodies, featuring a representative assembly of chieftains and free men. The Republic of Novgorod (Russia, 12th-15th centuries) developed a system where citizens elected officials and participated in a public assembly at about the same time that Medieval Swiss cantons (from the 13th century) established direct democratic systems with citizen assemblies making decisions through public voting. Also, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569-1795) featured a parliament with noble representatives and elected kings, though participation was limited to the nobility.More recently, the Corsican Republic (1755-1769) adopted a democratic constitution with universal male suffrage before being annexed by France. After that, we enter into decidedly modern territory, beginning with the foundation of the United States of America in 1776, followed by the flourishing of a number of western democracies during the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as further expansion to Asian countries (where the countries ranking highest by democracy index are Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea), Central and South America (top countries by democracy index: Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, Uruguay, and Jamaica), and Africa (top countries by democracy index: Cape Verde, Seychelles, and South Africa).What about outside the western world before of the spread of western style democracies? One example was the Iroquois Confederacy (1450-1600) in North America, which established a sophisticated democratic system with elected chiefs, separation of powers, and processes for impeachment, while governance among the Pueblo peoples of the north American Southwest featured community councils and consensual decision-making processes.The above should of course not be assumed to be anywhere near an exhaustive list, but should be enough to provide us with a sense of the history and cultural variety of democratic systems of government.How it worksHow do democracies function (when they do)? Here too there is an assortment of models. As we have seen, the original Athenian experiment was one in direct democracy, which involves each eligible citizen voting on laws and policies rather than electing representatives. Modern examples include referendums, ballot initiatives, and town hall meetings where everyone participates in decision-making. The downside of this is that, you know, you can easily condemn a Socrates to death that way.More seriously, one issue with direct democracy is that it is next to impossible for uncoordinated groups of individuals to think strategically about the complexities of government and consequently articulate coherent long-term policies. California is a good example. It's system of ballot initiatives is one modern application of direct democracy, but over the years it has resulted in a policy and economic mess. Why? Because people vote on individual measures without considering the broader context, which often means they vote to both reduce taxes and increase benefits. The two are in obvious tension and the cumulation of initiatives has constrained that state's legislature, making it increasingly difficult to govern in a sensible manner.One often hears of the Swiss system as a viable contemporary example of direct democracy, but things are a bit complicated. First of all, the system is actually a hybrid of direct and representative democracy—parliament and government still function, but major decisions face potential citizen override. Other than issues of low participation (around 40-50% turnout) and the potential for wealthy interests to influence outcomes through expensive campaigns, there are concerns—again—about the tyranny of the majority, as minority rights have sometimes been threatened, for instance in the cases of minaret construction by members of the Muslim minority and laws restricting immigration. Again, that's because the complexity of most issues often exceeds what average citizens can reasonably evaluate. Moreover, and just as problematically, the Swiss system requires high levels of civic education and political stability to function effectively, arguably more so than in the case of representative democracies, to which I will turn next. Critics have argued that it can lead to inconsistent policies or prevent necessary but unpopular reforms.The major alternative to the direct approach is representative democracy, whereby citizens elect officials to make decisions on their behalf, a descendant of the approach of the Roman Republic. This is by far the most common form today, with variations in how representatives are chosen and how much power they hold. One major set of variations concerns the trio of options that distinguishes parliamentary, presidential, and semi-presidential systems.Parliamentary systems feature a legislature (the parliament) that selects the executive leader (the prime minister) from among its members. The executive depends on maintaining parliamentary support and can be removed through votes of no confidence. Examples include the UK, Canada, and Germany. By contrast, presidential systems have citizens directly elect both the legislature and a separate executive (the president) who serves for a fixed term. The executive and legislature branches operate independently, with reciprocal checks and balances. The United States exemplifies this model (and, currently, it ain't working too well, as we've seen). There are also hybrid, so-called semi-presidential systems, which combine elements of both, with a directly elected president and a prime minister chosen by parliament. France and Russia use variations of this system, with obviously very different results.There are two other major sets of variations among representative democracies that we should briefly examine. One is the difference between federal and unitary systems, which pertains to how power is distributed. Federal systems divide authority between national and regional governments (like the US or Germany), while unitary systems concentrate power at the national level (like France or the UK). Read more",

      "content": "Credit: SeventyFourIf you major in philosophy, as I did, you will inevitably get jokes about whether they're hiring at the philosophy factory. The truth, though, is that philosophy majors have above-average earnings compared to the typical college graduate. And that's not just a function of would-be philosophers going to law school. People whose terminal degree is a bachelor's in philosophy earn pretty good money. Most philosophy departments have a line about this, pitching students on the very real value of the skills that philosophy undergraduates practice. I don't think those departmental lines are wrong, exactly. Skills like reading texts closely, understanding the logical structure of arguments, and writing persuasively certainly do come in handy in a wide range of settings. That said, I don't think this explains much about the relative earning power of a philosophy degree. The skills you learn studying history — reading documents, evaluating evidence — are also broadly applicable. What's interesting isn't that philosophy-type skills have some utility, it's that philosophy majors earn more than history majors or English majors or students of other traditional, non-STEM academic topics. And I think Scotty Hendricks nailed the explanation in a Big Think piece he wrote a couple of years ago: philosophy majors earn more because philosophy majors are smarter, on average, than students of other traditional liberal arts disciplines. But why are philosophy majors smarter? I don't fully understand the historical or sociological factors behind this. Whatever the factors are, though, they are highly contingent. Philosophy professors have higher GRE scores than professors of English or history or sociology. They run classes that are relatively difficult and that dissuade people from pursuing the major unless they're smart and hardworking. Philosophy graduate programs don't have many slots to offer, and the few slots they have go to people with high GRE scores. And the cycle continues. I was thinking about this the other day when I saw a round of Twitter discourse expressing frustration that English and history students don't get the same respect as STEM students. I believe deeply in the value of studying literature and history and philosophy and big ideas. And DOGE just gave the entire country an object lesson in the dangers of Arrogant Smart STEM Guy Syndrome. But if you want respect, you need to earn that respect. The way to make humanistic learning more respected and prestigious, it seems to me, is to make the classes harder. Assign more work. Grade the work more harshly. Get the laziest and dumbest students to opt out. And then repeat the cycle. The gut-course equilibrium This is a touchy subject, so I want to be clear. I'm talking here specifically about undergraduate education. What happens beyond that, I have much less information on, and the relevant considerations seem different. And I'm not saying that studying undergraduate-level humanities is inherently easier than studying a science or engineering topic. In fact, I'm saying the reverse. Read more",

      "content": "by Kyle Munkittrick Imagine you are in room of literati types in the early 2010s. These are smart, well-read, curious people. The books on their shelves are impressive, as are their movie collections. You notice classics, hits, and obscure artistic works on display. The conversation turns to favorite fictional characters and you bring up, say, Paulie Walnuts, Gus Fring, or Willow Rosenberg. You’re met with quiet looks of confusion. Ok, so these folks haven’t heard of any of these characters. You’re a bit disappointed, maybe even surprised that they hadn’t been participating in the Golden Age of Television. You try to recover and elicit a response by noting the hugely famous and influential shows you’re referencing. “Wow! You haven’t seen The Sopranos, Breaking Bad or Buffy the Vampire Slayer? I’m surprised. What TV shows do you like? Game of Thrones? Grey’s Anatomy?” The hosts and guests all look at you blankly, almost embarrassed for you, and reply, “I don’t watch TV.” Some one else says, “I’m not sure I’ve ever watched a show.” More than half of the room responds that way. One dude looks up, eager. “I watch TV” he says. You brighten! “I love football and the World Series of Poker.” He continues, “But I’m not into those talking shows.” At such an interaction you would not only be a bit gobsmacked, you would be, I suspect, saddened. This, broadly, has been my experience with narrative video games for the past few decades. We are living through a Golden Age of storytelling, but most of the population is missing out on it. It isn’t the crisis of men not reading or that romantasy is dominating the charts. It’s not because people are illiterate or lazy. Quite the opposite, in fact. Many of people who read Difficult Important Novels and make sure they are optimizing their time are among the least likely to have access to these great stories. That's because the stories are being told in video games. Most people don’t play video games; many don’t even know how. This means most people are missing out on a burgeoning new genre of literary fiction. The characters, themes, and storycraft are all literally inaccessible to a huge chunk of the people most likely to enjoy and appreciate them. This is, I think we can agree, not ideal. Skeptics will, rightly, ask how Fortnite is anything like My Brilliant Friend or White Lotus. Point for the skeptics—it’s not! Not any more or less, however, than is a Premiere League Football game or a Taschen coffee table book. Video games, like TV and books, encompass a huge range of things. TV can be live sports broadcasts, infomercials, and reality TV along side prestige shows like White Lotus or Severance. Books can be dry monographs, reference guides, or pulpy page turners as well as literature like Piranesi or My Brilliant Friend. In his interview with Tyler Cowen, Any Austin was trying to help Tyler understand this very point: “These competitive, large, long-lasting video games: Fortnite, VALORANT, Counter-Strike, whatever. We call them video games, and they absolutely are, but culturally, calling those video games and calling Zelda video games would be like grouping football in with theater.” What Austin is getting at is that games are, in a sense, matrixed against other forms of entertainment. Games like those he cites are e-sports. They’re played competitively and what narrative exists is as robust as that around any sport. For e-sports, video games are, in effect, the field and stadium where the match is held. And just as the existence of ESPN doesn’t obviate the existence of HBO on TV, the same can be said of games. Most games are like most TV shows and most movies. That’s not a bad thing! A ton of games are entertaining, fun, and delightful without being narratively complex. Every game in the Mario franchise meets this bar. Every fighting game, racing simulator, and nearly all massively-multiplayer online role-playing games are like this as well. No matter how great Tekken, Grand Turismo, and Destiny are, they are not literary. Tom Clancy games, like Tom Clancy books and movies, entertain and thrill without necessarily looking into the depths of our souls. Some games, however, attain a level of nuance and complexity of story telling that deserve to be seen alongside our best films, shows, and novels. And yet unless you play games, you have almost no frame of reference for whether or not this is possibly valid. Almost everyone reading this has seen a movie, watched a season of a TV show, or read a book in the past year. The majority of people reading this haven’t played any games in the past year and most people, between 60 – 80%, haven’t played a non-mobile game (i.e. Candy Crush). This creates a minor tragedy: You don’t know who Mordin Solus is. This is sad in its own way, but, of course, there are many great fictional characters you may not yet know. For the vast majority of such characters, this is a solvable problem—just watch the movie or read the book. Or, at least, you learn of them through cultural diffusion. I’ve never read Catcher in the Rye, but I’ve got a sense of who Holden Caulfield is, why he matters, what he stands for. But, alas, poor Mordin, you may never know him well. You may simply never learn how. Most great criticism and analysis of video games anchors on the medium. Are the game mechanics innovative, are the graphics beautiful, is the progression balanced? A story of some kind is often present, sure, but usually as ‘lore’ to be unpacked, as though the Silmarillion was the best part about The Lord of the Rings. Story, of course, has never been essential to an amazing video game. We do not know or care why Pac-Man must eat dots and cherries and kill ghosts. We do not know, really, why Mario is responsible for Princess Peach, or why he is a plumber who can defeat Bowser. Doom Eternal, Forza, and Minecraft are quite fun without robust character arcs. All you know, all you need to know in some games, is that things are suddenly happening and you are in control. These are not literary games. They are closer to chess or model trains or table top games. Ostensibly there is a frame of some kind (e.g. the pieces represent opposing armies). But the rules and the opponent are the point. It’s a test of skill and smarts. It’s also entertainment. Literary games, however, focus on the depth and quality of the narrative. In particular, the inner life of the characters and deeper themes are given a place of pride among the other elements. Just as Moby-Dick is a great adventure story, Station Eleven a dangerous post-apocalypse, and Wolf Hall a courtesan drama, literary games are not pure philosophy. The craft is in how the story is told. While the novel is the primary vessel for literary books, single-player role-playing games (RPGs) tend to be home to most literary games. There are, as always, exceptions: platformers like the Ori series, rogue-likes such as Hades, and first-person shooters like Half-Life or Bioshock can achieve literary qualities, but it’s rarer. Massively-multiplayer online RPGs (MMORPGs) such as World of Warcraft, Destiny 2, Diablo 4 and similar titles are technically RPGs, but their online presence makes them more akin to The Simpsons or Law & Order or maybe even The Office, where the comfort, fun repetition, and similarity keep people coming back for decades. Single-player role-playing games tend to be ‘open-world’. The player drives the story forward at their own pace, choosing among plot or sub plots they’re most interested in. Often the player can build her own ‘team’, allowing the main characters of the story to be the player’s choice. As a result, these games like Baulder’s Gate 3, Fallout 4, the Mass Effect series, and Disco Elysium can have hundreds of thousands or millions of lines of dialogue, many tens of thousands of which you the player may never hear. While occasionally these are exposition dumps explaining what the latest MacGuffin you need pursue is, most follow the ‘show don’t tell’ rule. You experience the narrative and nuances of this world, its problems, through not only your actions, but through the needs and wants of characters you meet, team up with, and/or battle. Thus, there are two huge barriers to experiencing these characters. The first is the ability to play a video game–even moderately well. This can include dexterity, puzzle solving, or reaction time. Games are, well, games. They challenge the player. The second is time. Even a substantial show like Breaking Bad, with 62 episodes roughly about 50 minutes long is only 51 hours of story. Two episodes a night, most nights of the week, and you’re through it in a couple months. But for most folks, even dedicated close watchers who treat TV like literature, TV is a passive endeavor. Think about how intimidating it is to read a hefty chunk of lit, say The Brothers Karamazov or Moby-Dick. One of those might take you around 20 hours of effort. For experienced gamers, most literary games, such as Control, Horizon Zero Dawn, or God of War take a minimum of 30 hours to complete the main story. Many literary games, particularly role-playing games like Mass Effect, Fallout 4, and Baulder’s Gate 3 take 60 – 70 hours if you are just focused on the core story. With all of these, half the fun is just wandering around and talking to other characters, doing little side quests, and exploring the world. The ‘open world’ nature of the game allows you to experience huge chunks of the story, particularly sub-plots, in the order of your choosing. Often these will influence each other, leading you to naturally move among sub plots at your own speed. This can easily double the play time and often dramatically deepens the quality of the story. Which brings us back to Mordin. Most stories take place within a single game. Even the colossal Baulder’s Gate 3 is a stand alone game. But Mass Effect is a series of three games, a true trilogy, where the story compounds. Yes, you can play each game stand alone, but the games will look for your previous save files and your choices in the prior games will affect the current story. Yes, your decisions in Mass Effect have genuine consequences for the end of Mass Effect 3, just like the characters actions in the first books of Lord of the Rings or the Neapolitan novels echo through the full series. We learn about Mordin over the course of second and third Mass Effect games. The player’s choices affect his arc. This, in and of itself is fascinating, because some players may never get to experience Mordin’s best arc because of compounding choices in their own play through. When you meet Mordin he is kind of a fun psychopath—a brilliant, charming, and ruthless scientist-solider. Over the course of almost a hundred hours of story, you and your compatriots learn he has a deep moral code governed by near pure act consequentialism. In what I believe is his best arc, Mordin’s story ends with him sacrificing himself to undo an atrocity committed by his species against another. He signs off with a line just as curt and arrogant as when we first meet him, yet with a depth of caring and heart that emerges only through what amounts to years of friendship and camaraderie. He is explaining why he must be the one to do it, even if it means his death: “My project. My work. My cure. My responsibility...[Don’t be sorry]. I’m not. Had to be me... Someone else might have gotten it wrong.” Mordin’s story is as important as that of Duncan Idaho, Starbuck (either of them), Magwitch, or Furiosa, but far less accessible. As a result, not only do fewer people get to experience it first hand, but the stories from games struggle to get into the popular consciousness. They are, in a sense, trapped. And that’s a shame. For those of you who have thus far eschewed video games because you doubt their literary merit, I hope I’ve made the case that it’s as present (and rare) as it is in film, TV shows, and novels. If you’ve hesitated to dive in due to a fear of complexity or difficulty, I encourage you to treat gaming as you would reading a great text. Yes, it will take time. The Wire is famously unforgiving and the colossal literary doorstops of the 90s aren’t well known for their gripping plots or likable characters. But that’s not the point is it? Video games have been left out of the Great Conversation too long. While it’ll take a bit of work on all our parts, it’s time to bring them into the fold. Enjoying the content on 3QD?

      "content": "Washington State’s Mount Rainier is one of the snowiest mountains in the world. Over the years, all of that snow has birthed dozens of living glaciers, which flow across the landscape. One such resident, the Paradise Glacier, drapes onto one side of the mountain at more than 8,400 feet above sea level. It cascades over the peak with a thick icy sheen. Here, the air is crisp and quiet. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Paradise Glacier is smaller than many of its majestic, icy neighbors—it is meek, now covering less than a quarter of a square mile. But, says Scott Hotaling, a professor of watershed sciences at Utah State University who has spent more than 500 hours roaming the glacier, even small mountain glaciers don’t feel so small when you’re on them.“You can stand on one side of it and you can’t see where it ends on the other side,” he says of Paradise. While on the glacier, in what might seem to many people a barren environment of rock, snow, and ice, Hotaling says he can feel the abundance of life pulsing below him. He can feel its precise layers and intertwined stories.They emerge by the billions. Protruding out of the snow like hair growing out of a scalp. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . “These glaciers are actually way more diverse than anyone realizes,” he adds. Microbes adapted to life at the extreme, hardy tardigrades, and mysterious ice worms that crawl to the surface only under the cover of night, blooms of algae as bright red as blood, and even roving wolverines, all depend on this glacier. And as Hotaling and other glacial ecologists are finding, science is just scratching the surface of life in this one well studied glacier: Melting down a small bit of glacial ice here can reveal genetic traces from every domain of life. To say nothing of the many lesser-studied glaciers around the globe.“It’s a wild place,” says Hotaling, who has spent years studying Paradise’s hidden ecosystems. But as the glacier—and so many others—are at risk of imminent death by global warming, he and his colleagues worry we’re losing more life than we can fathom.The story of life in a glacier can be told from the bottom up.Where the glacier meets the bedrock, the subglacial zone, is among the most exotic. Because this part of the glacier has very little oxygen and—being up to 100 feet under ice—receives very little light, it is rife with microbes that have adapted to extreme conditions on Earth.1 Here, chemolithoautotrophic bacteria harvest their energy from breaking down iron and sulfur in the weathering bedrock below. Methanogens and methanotrophs feed off methane when there is no oxygen around them. Other microbes decompose ancient organic carbon found in the rock. Nutrients and flecks of carbon make their way to the bottom through slivers of meltwater seeping through fissures in the ice; sometimes they puddle in small lakes of freshwater, locked inside the glacier. And Hotaling notes they are only just starting to learn about the many wild lifeforms eking out an existence in this obscured niche—with more new interactions being discovered every time scientists are able to look. “There’s just a lot of really kind of crazy stuff that happens down there,” he says.

LIFE ON ICE: Notoriously hardy tardigrades—who can survive conditions even in outer space—make a living in the glacial ice on Paradise, feeding on algae and other scarce victuals scavenged in the harsh realm. Credit: Tobetv / Shutterstock.Above this zone sits a thick layer of ice, from 30 to nearly 100 feet, known as the glacial zone. Pockets of life may accumulate in splinters and cracks in the ice. Surviving here, inside the pressurized freeze, is challenging. “This area is dark. It has very few nutrients. It’s very cold,” says Hotaling.But, ascending through the ice, the hot spot of activity on a glacier is a lot like where life is most abundant in the ocean: The top 2 inches of the glacier appears to be where the majority of its biological activity occurs. This area is covered in snow for part of the year, during the winter. And in warmer seasons, it is an area where the glacier’s ice is exposed. Hotaling and colleagues sampled clumps of snow from the top of Paradise Glacier in 21 different spots over 5 months and found more than 4,700 types of bacteria and more than 3,000 types of fungi.2“The different domains of life are all represented,” says Daniel Shain, a zoologist from Rutgers University who has studied microbes in Paradise Glacier with Hotaling for several years. Shain does something called a metagenome analysis of glaciers: He takes samples of glacial ice, melts them, extracts their environmental DNA, sequences it to figure out what’s there, and uses that data to model how glacier-bound organisms thrive in such a harsh environment. While he has yet to do a metagenomic analysis of Paradise, he has dived into that of similar glaciers in Alaska. What the findings suggest is that organisms that live in and on the top layers of ice and snow seem to have figured out a way to make more energy with fewer resources, compared to typical, terrestrial soil organisms.3 ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The top inches of the glacier are also home to reddish and blood orange colored, cold-loving snow algae, Sanguina algae, which create what hikers often call “watermelon snow.” During the winter months, when snow is thick and light is sparse, these algae species lie dormant inside the snowpack as cysts buried up to some 10 inches deep. But during spring and early summer, the cysts germinate, and the algae migrate to the surface of the soft snow, where they bask in the sun, accumulating red carotenoids like we accumulate melanin in our skin, to protect their cells from UV and heat. Given their deep color, the algae also darken the surface and increase the rate at which ice on the glacier melts by as much as 20 percent. This produces little dips in the glacier—like little dimples in its face—where bacteria and other microorganisms can make a better living, in turn, helping to keep the water from freezing again with the energy they produce through their metabolism.Like grass in a pastureland, the algae feed miniscule grazing animals on top of the glacier, whether it is ice or snow, including rotifers, arthropods called springtails, and tardigrades—the chubby, gummy-bear looking animals known for their astounding ability to thrive in extreme conditions (including outer space). These and other hardy microinvertebrates, no larger than about 0.02 inches long, contribute to much of the nutrient cycling and decomposition that occurs on the snowfield overlaying glaciers. (Even if it is orders of magnitude lower than the nutrient cycling that happens among grassland, for instance.)Glacial ice can reveal genetic traces from every domain of life.But in Paradise Glacier, these critters are less abundant—and much more difficult to find, says Shain—than in many other glaciers around the world. That’s because they face competition from one of the most bizarre of the glacier’s residents: ice worms. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . After living in the deep darkness of the ice through much of the year, as spring rolls around, every afternoon, as soon as the sun starts to set, half-inch-long ice worms make their way out of the ice and through the snow. The threadlike worms wriggle upward and migrate to the surface: They emerge by the billions. Protruding out of the snow like hair growing out of a scalp. Not much is known about them—what they do during the winter, how they survive in the ice despite not being able to withstand temperatures below freezing, or why they come out just at night. But Shain’s work has found that, like glacial microbes, ice worms are also exceptional at creating energy inside their cells.“That helps to explain why ice worms are the only macroscopic organism that lives on ice,” says Shain. “Everything else is really, really small. Ice worms are a big outlier.” (Another strange ice worm fact is that they have also evolved to be “one of the most UV-resistant organisms that we know of,” says Shain, perhaps to make do as light-absorbingly dark creatures living so close to the sun; though their nocturnal habits raise still more questions about this adaptation.)VANISHED CAVES: Paradise Glacier once held enormous ice caves—which were popular attractions for hikers and tourists, such as this person photographed in one of the glacier’s caves in 1923. In the past few decades, the last of the caves have melted away. Credit: Lawrence Denny Lindsley / Wikimedia Commons.On the surface of the glacier, together with ice worms, insects called ice crawlers roam over from their terrestrial hiding places at the edges of the glacier. Known to science as grylloblattids, the inch-long insects with cockroach faces and no wings scavenge on the glacier’s surface, picking up any nutrient-rich debris that’s been blown there by the wind: dust, pollen, ash from wildfires, smaller organisms, and other insects blown in by too strong a gust and marooned on ice. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Birds from above, in turn, fly onto the ice, plucking ice crawlers and ice worms out of the snow and into their hungry bills.4 Songbirds, including the great crowned rosy finch, perch on the soft snow, together with mountain bluebirds, ravens, white tailed ptarmigans, American kestrels, horned larks, and American pipits.But, as a small bird, a glacier is a dangerous place to forage, says Hotaling. A dark-backed bird loitering on a widespread white surface is an easy target for a bird of prey, and raptors and hawks are known to patrol glaciers, swooping down and snatching songbirds off the peaceful snow. In fact, Hotaling has noticed that, when foraging, songbirds like the rosy finches tend to stay near the margins of the ice, likely so they can easily get onto the rocks where there are places to hide if a hunting raptor dives.Bigger animals, including mountain goats, hoary marmots, Cascade red foxes, or even wolverines, lie down to rest on the glacier’s ice to cool down from the beating summer sun, and use the snowpack to travel from one side of the mountain to another. In summer 2021, Hotaling put camera traps all over the glacier and captured photographs of the first family of wolverines on the glacier in that area in more than 100 years.5THE LAST OF PARADISE: Paradise Glacier is about 12 percent of the size it was when it was mapped in 1913.

The glacier supports life downstream, too. As the snow and ice thaw, meltwater from Paradise Glacier births the eponymous Paradise River. Here, where the ice becomes water just above 39 degrees Fahrenheit, life changes radically.In the coldest first reaches of the seasonal melt, the melting ice brings dissolved organic carbon, which, activated by sunlight, clings in a nutritious biofilm on top of the bedrock: It feeds the largest animals found here, such as aquatic insects, black fly larvae, and stone flies, including a rare species known as the northern forestfly. Slightly farther downstream, life gets bigger, large fish appear, including various salmon species, the endangered bull trout and cutthroat trout, sculpins, and whitefish.Humans, too, rely on Paradise Glacier. The glacier’s meltwater provides irrigation for agriculture downstream, drinking water to nearby communities, and it eventually feeds into hydropower plants such as the Alder Dam farther down on the Nisqually River. And hikers and mountaineers make their way up the river and onto the snow for scientific research, for recreation and sport, or for artistic inspiration.The Mount Rainier landscape has hosted the Cowlitz, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Squaxin Island, Yakama, and Coast Salish people for millennia. Archeological artifacts suggest that—while the mountain was fully covered in ice and snow up until about 9,000 years ago—ancestors of these tribes were foraging, hunting, and gathering on the slopes as soon as the first plants and trees sprang up. Records suggest they’d collect huckleberries or hunt mountain goats and gather cedar bark to make baskets and hats. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . By the late 1700s, European and American visitors became captivated by the landscape of the mountain and its glaciers, too.“Of all the fire mountains which like beacons; once blazed along the Pacific Coast, Mount. Rainier is the noblest,” wrote the Scottish-American writer and conservationist John Muir, who climbed the mountain in 1888.Yet, the noble mountain is losing its blaze.Paradise Glacier, for one, is dying. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . “When you have a big ice cave, you’re in the heart of the glacier, and it means the heart is no longer beating.”“Right now, it’s about 12 percent of the size that it was in 1913 when it was mapped,” says Mauri Pelto, director of the North Cascades Glacier Climate Project at Nichols College, of the glacier.The first time he visited Paradise, in 1985, Pelto stepped inside its large, long-famous ice caves, which had been a draw for tourists since at least the early 1920s, when people could access part of the then-massive glacier more easily from roads. While mesmerizing, the ice caves were already a sign of the glacier’s decay. “When you have a big ice cave, you’re in the heart of the glacier, and it means the heart is no longer beating,” says Pelto, quoting his daughter, with whom he’s hiked up to the glacier several times. “Because if a glacier is moving and alive, it won’t allow a big cavity like that to form.” Shortly after Pelto’s first visits, in the late ’80s, that lower part of Paradise Glacier melted away and was proclaimed dead—the upper part of Paradise Glacier is all that’s left now.“Paradise is just following the path of the Stevens Glacier, the Van Trump Glacier, and the Pyramid Glacier; they are all gone now,” says Pelto of the other glaciers that once adorned Mount Rainier. At the rate it is melting, Pelto speculates, we’ll bid goodbye to the Paradise Glacier—and all of the life inside and on it, discovered and not—within 15 years. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . As the glacier rapidly dies, late in the summer, when the climate is dry and warm, it is also already producing 80 percent less runoff than it used to, says Pelto. This means the streams it feeds may become depleted and see their temperature increase rapidly, affecting the life of all of the aquatic invertebrates that have adapted over millennia to the frigid waters, and all of the fish swimming, feeding, and reproducing in the rivers below.There may be some unlikely survivors, though. Shain, for instance, has a hunch that, despite their name, the ice worms may be best poised to weather the heat.Geological data suggest that the Pacific Northwest has experienced multiple warm periods over the past several million years, with temperatures getting even a few degrees warmer than the area is experiencing now, and the glaciers fully melting. Yet genetic data Shain’s collected suggests ice worms may have been around in that part of North America for millions of years, meaning that they somehow survived those warmer eras.6 The worms cannot migrate long distances, so they cannot have come from very far.Maybe even in the direst of warming scenarios, there will be pockets of ice that persist, where the creatures of the glacier can find refuge throughout the decades, says Shain. Given how little we know about ice worms—and how little we know, to be honest, about so much of life in glaciers—maybe there is also a silver lining in our ignorance: potential to be surprised.

During our frequent treks through the woods, he’s around to answer my endless questions and test my ID skills. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . But before I could even guess the species surrounding me, I carried a valuable intuition—I just didn’t know it yet. When entering a well-traveled city park or suburban trail, I could tell that something was off. Now, it’s clear to me that I subconsciously picked up on the domineering greenery that evolved to live in landscapes thousands of miles away, places far wetter and hotter than here. I could tell, somehow, that invasive plants were crowding these once-diverse oases.I’m not alone in this intuition. Some people might instinctively pick up on biodiversity in a forest without any training, according to a study published last month in the journal People and Nature.Researchers from across Europe asked 48 people, who were mostly psychology students lacking forestry or ecology training, to rank the perceived biodiversity within images of European forests and explain their reasoning. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Some of these amateurs’ ratings seemed to align with survey methods used by ecologists. In the visual test, people tended to associate particularly green forest images with more biodiversity. This association lines up with scientific measures for biodiversity, which is linked to an overall abundance of vegetation. A landscape with high biodiversity, for instance, can reduce competition between plants for resources and help plenty of greenery thrive.Certain study subjects also completed a related assessment where they listened to audio recordings of bird sounds taken in the same German forests. The participants called out various aspects used by researchers to estimate bird diversity, including the “acoustic complexity” of avian songs and the number of sounds heard per second.While I’m glad some of us might be hardwired to pick up on healthy, booming ecosystems, the paper has its limitations: The team surveyed a small group of people in a laboratory setting, for instance. It might have been more challenging for more participants to correctly estimate surrounding biodiversity while out in nature. In past research, Anthropocene notes, amateurs tested in a 2023 paper weren’t too skilled at guessing the degree of biodiversity while in forests.Regardless of whether you excel at putting your finger on flora, that study suggested that the sites we see as biodiverse may boost our mental health—regardless of their actual composition—so get out there and explore.

      "content": "Four thousand years ago, a woman had a very fancy artiﬁcial eye that she probably wore while she was alive. It was possibly made of natural tar and animal fat or maybe bitumen paste; it had a gilded surface and a central circle where the iris would be, with lines radiating outward, sunlike. Gold wires inside the eye imitated capillaries. Archaeologists discovered this item in 2006 during an excavation of Shahr-e Sukhteh, otherwise known as the Burnt City, in what is now Southeastern Iran. The woman had been six feet tall and around 30 years old when she died. The prosthetic was in her left eye socket. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . An even older eye was found in a skeleton in Spain. This one was estimated to be 7,000 years old. However, it could not have been worn comfortably and was placed backward in the socket, probably after the man’s death.Eye makers for millennia, then, have been trying to re-create the expressionist power of one of the human body’s most complex and emotionally meaningful organs.Ocularists are nearly as rare as astronauts. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Histories of artificial eyes tend to start with the ancient Egyptians, who were pretty good at making eyes for mummies. They “removed the eyes of the dead, poured wax or plaster into the orbits, and then inserted precious stones to simulate the iris,” according to one history. But they weren’t all that sophisticated in their techniques for the living: an eye-size piece of clay painted to look like an eye and then secured over the socket with a piece of flesh-colored cloth. Those histories usually jump over centuries—to the mid-1500s—before describing any real progress, particularly in the design of an ocular prosthetic meant to fit into the socket rather than in front of it.The 16th-century French military surgeon Ambroise Paré is often noted as the first to describe replacement eyes in use at the time, though he made no claim to have invented them. One was a metal prosthetic—perhaps gold—meant to fit under the eyelids to cover a shrunken eye. Paré called this type of eye a “hyplepharon.” For someone whose bad eye wasn’t shrunken and so didn’t allow room for anything else in the socket, there was an “ekblepheron”: a steel spring that wrapped around the head and widened into an oval surface at the front end. The oval was covered in leather and painted with the image of an eye and eyelids. Not surprisingly, both types were clumsy and uncomfortable, and neither created much or any illusion of reality. Few people wore either.Later in the 16th century, the Murano glassmakers of Venice introduced glass eyes: thin and fragile shells not much more comfortable, by any accounts, than the metal ones. Nonetheless, Venetian eyes were the best a one-eyed person could get for more than a century. Even when Paris became the dominant source of prosthetic eyes in the early 19th century—eyes there were porcelain—the product was frequently disappointing. “Very inferior articles,” an article in 1856 about new developments in eye design called those earlier eyes. They consisted of “an oval shell, exactly like half of a bird’s egg.” They “varied only in size and colour, the same piece being used for both the left and right side.” Such a primitive and simplistic design “gave the wearers much pain, produced a staring effect, and imparted to the face a repulsive aspect.”I learned about the ancient artiﬁcial eyes during a gathering of contemporary eye makers in 2023 in Las Vegas. A woman named Emily Brunson, who was in the middle of her ﬁve-year apprenticeship to become a professional eye maker, gave a presentation. The room was ﬁlled with eye makers who seemed to appreciate the deeply historical roots of their work. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Today, we call professional eye makers ocularists. They work in a ﬁeld called ocularistry. They are not doctors. They have a variety of backgrounds: sometimes sculpture or painting, sometimes medical illustration, sometimes special-eﬀects makeup artistry, sometimes something completely unrelated to eye making. Most often, they are self-employed, owners of their own small businesses, or work for a self-employed ocularist. Almost always, you’ll ﬁnd their offices in medical parks next to those of orthodontists, veterinarians, optometrists, urologists, allergists, dermatologists. Sometimes they’ll be in brick buildings by themselves on thoroughfares near shopping malls and fast-food restaurants or on the sixth ﬂoor of a building downtown. Many times, an ocularist will belong to a family with generations of ocularists, the older teaching the younger, the business passed on like an heirloom. You can ﬁnd third-generation and even ﬁfth-generation ocularists.They don’t fall out of sockets and roll across ﬂoors because they are not round.And yet ocularists are nearly as rare as astronauts. Fewer than 200 certiﬁed ocularists scatter themselves across the United States. The most populous states (California, New York, Texas) might have a dozen each, and more rural states (Utah, Kansas, Vermont) might have one, maybe two, sometimes none. Around the world, their numbers are equally small, or even much smaller. In India, for instance, for a population of 1.4 billion, there are only about three dozen ocularists.The eyes ocularists make now are not like the one belonging to the woman from the Burnt City, and they’re certainly not like those in some common popular-culture representations. For instance, they don’t, as in some cartoons and movies, fall out of sockets and roll across ﬂoors, horrifying those whose feet they rumble past, because they are not round. Nor are they clear plastic, ﬁlled with circuitry, simultaneously space-agey and gumbally, like the “bionic visual cortex terminal” from The Six Million Dollar Man. That device, we learn from the show’s intro, when Steve Austin is being rebuilt after barely surviving a crash of his test plane, connects by some cord directly backward into his occipital lobe. No. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Nor is a “glass eye,” most of the time, even glass. The dominant material these days is acrylic, although glass eyes are still being made.Most importantly, maybe, the eyes that ocularists make do not yet restore vision, especially not with a zoom ratio of 20.2 to 1, like Austin’s bionic eye. They might do so someday, and scientists have made small steps in that direction. For now, though, the function of a prosthetic eye is much less physiological than it is artistic. It is meant not to create vision but to create illusion, not to see but to shape how its wearer is seen.There are a couple of reasons most people know little about prosthetic eyes or where they come from. First, there is that small number of eye makers. Second, if a prosthetic eye is made to be as realistic as possible and to ﬁt well, no one will know it exists. Ocularists’ goal is not to call attention to their work. (There are exceptions for people who want “fun” eyes—ones decorated with sports logos or a heart or pretty much anything else that can be painted on a small space.)Soon after I got my own prosthetic eye in 2009, a cashier at the grocery store said, “You have the most beautiful blue eyes,” and I thanked her and asked if she could tell which one was real. I was still in the initial euphoria of having the gift of the eye, and I couldn’t help bragging, though she had no idea what I was talking about, and she seemed only a little less confused when I tapped my ﬁngernail against my eye so she could hear the click. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . My experience with getting an eye was one of intimacy and gratitude. Visits to my ocularist from the time of my eye’s creation—which took two days—through every annual polishing have been long stretches of personal attention and care that seem increasingly rare in a medical world of high volume, crazy insurance regulations, and systemic stress. Maybe the extended eye contact required is a big reason for that. Maybe it’s the fact that handcrafting and hand painting an eye takes hours. Maybe it’s that the profession asks its practitioners to employ not only their technical and artistic skills but also their skills of listening and empathy. My ocularist has told me that his business is “probably 75 percent psychology and 25 percent an actual product that I make.” The healing to which an artiﬁcial eye contributes is never merely aesthetic.The expressive power of real eyes can be frustratingly elusive in the making of an artiﬁcial eye. Damage to an eye socket—from an accident, a ﬁre, cancer—is sometimes so extensive that an ocularist cannot achieve full harmony and symmetry and what seems in the best cases like magic.Still, magic does often happen.I’ve spent years trying to understand how this magic happens—why people have tried to replicate lost eyes for millennia, and how, for someone missing an eye or burdened by a disfigured one, an artfully crafted and generously given artificial eye can help heal. Not by restoring perfect function, but by easing the trauma that touches the very core of a person’s identity. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .

      "content": "by David Beer There was a prevailing idea, George Orwell wrote in a 1946 essay on the Common Toad, ‘that this is the age of machines and that to dislike the machine, or even to want to limit its domination, is backward-looking, reactionary and slightly ridiculous.’ It was only a couple of years before his surveillance society classic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. The aside in Orwell's short essay captured a sense of pressure to keep-up with the technological changes of the time, a pressure to not fall behind and to not look outdated. We are feeling such pressures magnified again by the vast coverage and seemingly dramatic expansion of artificial intelligence. To not use AI, to dislike AI, to seek to limit AI, might, in Orwell’s terms, be seen to be slightly ridiculous. There is a pressure to turn to AI to be ever smarter, more predictive, anticipatory, ahead-of-the-game, knowing, hyper-efficient and so on. There is, as Orit Halpern and Robert Mitchell have put it, a ‘smartness mandate’. We are expected to be integrating AI into how we think, work and do things. This is partly because appearing to be algorithmic and AI savvy is equated with seeming switched-on. A more AI focused future can seem an inevitability. It is just too slick and the possibilities are too great for it to be held back. There is an imagined future already set out for us, an imagined ‘silicon future’ John Cheney-Lippold has recently argued, in which the future seems to already be planned out and so somehow precedes our present. At the same time this AI future is not as predictable as it might seem, when we factor in the unrest over training data access, the convoluted financial underpinnings of the AI itself, and the profoundly uncertain economic and geopolitical circumstances. It is tempting to evoke the idea of the human as a category in response to the rise of AI. Yet it is a long time since we could pretend to ourselves that humans are discrete entities, or that we somehow exist outside of our technological environments. We are too entangled with data infrastructures to be able to separate ourselves from them. We are, Katherine Hayles tells us, part of a ‘cognitive assemblage’ in which our thinking is distributed across systems and networks. As the same time, where algorithms and AI are integrated it nearly always creates tensions and what Minna Ruckenstein has called 'frictions'. The path to AI is not as smooth and slick as it might appear. In a recent project exploring the use of algorithms in risk assessment and access decisions in housing, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, on which I was part of the research team, one thing we found to be prevalent was a form of automation hesitancy. Automation hesitancy occurs where there are confidence deficits in the algorithmic systems or AI being implemented. People are actually cautious and tentative in the face of AI. The presence of AI and other algorithms systems can create profound uncertainties, with people unsure how to react, how to respond, how to use them and in what ways. Questions arise about where the limits should be and what is appropriate for AI use. And so on. Algorithmic decision-making and AI create questions for people whenever they encounter them, not least because they can challenge established practices, expertise, status and knowledge. The algorithms are in tensions with established limits of knowledge and human input. The result is that AI is adopted unevenly and with varied pace and range. There are subtleties to how people integrate algorithms. Despite the hesitations, we found a strong sense that there was an expectation or even an inevitability of more automation to come in the future. This was already being imagined, and was shaping behaviours in the present. With people then trying to work out how to fit into those imagined future scenes. This future was itself in tension with the actualities of the present. I’m sure that this automation hesitancy is more widespread than we might expect. In our project we were focusing on one sector, but the feeling is likely to appear in lots of other places. You may have found yourself hesitating. The reasons for this may not be simple, and may not even be something you can articulate. What is clear though, is if you are hesitant about AI you are far from alone. Orwell might have encouraged you to reflect on the pressure leading to the use of AI. Let me conclude by turning to another literary figure. Last year I was doing some research for a piece telling the story of the novelist J.G. Ballard commissioning computer generated poetry for a literary magazine in the 1970s. I’d started that piece after stumbling on a brief mention of the generated texts in his autobiography. I dug out the poems from the archive to see what they were like. The task seemed a useful antidote to the heated coverage of the present generative systems. Whilst working on that piece. I read a short story by Ballard from 1961 entitled ‘Studio 5, The Stars’. In Ballard's tale poetry had come to be written by machines. Poets simply input information using a set of control dials and the ‘VT’ machines would jump into action producing endless poems. It was a luxurious world. As one colleague of the imagined literary editor in the story pointed out: ‘Fifty years ago a few people wrote poetry, but no one read it. Now no one writes it either. The VT set merely simplifies the whole process.’ Soaked in a cold irony, Ballard’s story seems to be suggesting, over 60 years ago, that when the time comes we should be careful what we automate and be cautious of the consequences it might have for how we think and what we are capable of doing. When all of the VT machines were smashed in the latter part of Ballard’s story, the poets soon realise that they can no longer actually create written works. It is not that we shouldn’t use AI, of course, but that we might also sometimes hesitate and question the desires and ideals underpinning our will to automate. Enjoying the content on 3QD?

      "content": "This story is published in collaboration with the Local Catch Network. With the 2014 school year in full swing, Jenn Lovewell, the then-acting director of the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District, noticed something was conspicuously missing from her schools’ lunchrooms. “We were doing a lot of work in the district around farms, so we had a lot of beautiful salad bars full of fresh local produce and free range chicken, grass fed beef, all that stuff,” recalls Lovewell. “But I really wanted a source of seafood — local seafood — because [what] we served otherwise was frozen fish sticks.” For Monterey Bay, which was once given the moniker “Serengeti of the sea” in a nod to the region’s aquatic diversity and abundance, the omission of seafood from the local public school menu was glaring. The bay is massive, curving along 276 miles of wind-whipped, mid-California coastline. And its waters even more so: the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, a federally protected ocean preserve created by NOAA in 1992, encompasses a little over 6,000 square miles of ocean, where sea lions tangle in the dappled light of kelp forests, wrasses feast on sea slugs, and fat, pink starfish decorate rocks nestled in foamy tide pools. Monterey Bay once earned the moniker “Serengeti of the sea” thanks to its aquatic diversity and abundance. Courtesy of Bay2Tray The bay is also, historically, a nourishing place for humans. Since time immemorial, Indigenous fishers built and maintained sustainable fisheries that supported their societies with species like abalone and Pacific salmon. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the bay was the epicenter of a sardine boom led by the Booth Cannery Company, and at its peak, the sardine fishery that supported Cannery Row produced 250,000 tons of canned fish a year. But toward the end of the 20th century, the sardine population had been overfished, and the industry saw a majority of its canneries close. By 2014, the environment students in Lovewell’s school district saw through their classroom windows was drastically changed, and in the place of the active wharves that once defined the area’s culture were saltwater taffy shops and sweatshirt stands. As Lovewell’s mission came into focus, so did the region’s changes. “There was no working waterfront anymore,” Lovewell says. “There just weren’t local fishermen at the scale needed to be able to serve a school district.” Programs like Bay2Tray provide a market that supports small-scale fishers. Courtesy of Bay2Tray Lovewell calls this period of time her “crash course” in the complexities — and contradictions — of fisheries and seafood at large scale in the United States. “So much of our seafood caught here in the U.S. gets exported, and [meanwhile] we are importing cheaper, farmed-raised seafood from other countries,” she explains. It seemed absurd to her that the 10,000 students of the Monterey school district, many of whom could gaze out their classroom windows at waves of the Pacific crashing upon the shore, didn’t have access to the fish in those very same waters. Lovewell set out to change that. Weighed down by negative news? Our smart, bright, weekly newsletter is the uplift you’ve been looking for. [contact-form-7] In Monterey County, where the average annual household income is $94,486 — just slightly over the national average of $80,610 — class variance effectively reflects, and in some cases determines, access to fresh seafood. A study conducted by Stanford University in 2024 found that wealthy and generally white individuals (both as residents and tourists) have better financial access to fresh seafood despite the fact that the county has a high diversity of racial and ethnic, particularly Latinx, identities. These lower income groups generally have lower financial access to that same fish coming out of the oceanic commons. Meanwhile, in lieu of participating in commercial fishing operations, some fishers prefer to make their own sales connections in local markets. But this choice comes at a cost, and often it is tougher for fishers to make a living wage. This phenomenon is described in the study as a problem of “poverty on both sides,” where local communities can barely afford to purchase fresh seafood and local fishers can barely afford to fish for it. Bay2Tray connects Monterey Bay area schools with local fishers to purchase their bycatch. Courtesy of Bay2Tray This imbalance isn’t new. Similar conditions plagued the agricultural industry in the middle of the 20th century, and in response, Community-Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs started popping up to create affordable and efficient local supply chains. Both consumer and farmer stood to benefit from this new system, where individuals could sign up for a subscription-based acquisition program, creating both predictable capital for farmers and reliable, nutritious food for consumers. The idea was a revelation for farmers who had been edged out of profitable outcomes by corporate agriculture, and experts in other fields, like the fisheries, sought to replicate the program. Ten years ago, Jenn Lovewell and her partner, Alan Lovewell, saw an opportunity to modify the CSF (Community-Supported Fishery) model with a twist of their own: in addition to individuals with subscriptions, they would enable institutions to buy seafood directly from fishers. As Ryan O’Connor, a PhD candidate at Stanford University’s Doerr School of Sustainability and author of the Stanford study, explains, “[CSFs] create an institutionalized and really consistent market to support fishers in moving these products,” but to make a small, local fishery successful, you must have buy in from larger groups. “If you have institutions that have power and if you have these long standing sort of multilateral agreements between the local fishers, and a school … it creates these markets in ways that are really sustainable.” In 2014, the Lovewells founded the Sea-to-School program Bay2Tray as a CSF-modeled organization that connected Monterey Bay area schools with local fishers to purchase their bycatch (the unwanted species caught incidentally while fishing for another type of fish). Key to the pilot’s launch was what turned out to be the most important participants in the endeavor: the children. The team set up booths on playgrounds and in lunchrooms, and served sample bites of recipes made with local seafood, like ceviche with chips or fish burgers. They asked for honest feedback, created a voting system and supplied participating kids with stickers with phrases like “I love it” or “I tried it.” More often than not, kids who said they didn’t eat seafood ended up reaching for the “I love it” sticker. “On the day that we were going to pilot the local fish tacos, [it] was such a success, we sold more fish tacos than we did pizza,” recalls Lovewell. Young students line up to try seafood provided by Fishermen Feeding Mainers at Freeport Elementary School in southern Maine. Courtesy of the Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association Lovewell and O’Connor agree that buy-in from the kids is crucial for the Sea-to-School mission to succeed. “The cafeteria is an extension of the classroom,” says Lovewell. “So we can really teach them without them even knowing that they’re learning about food and about their bodies and about choices.” Often kids bring home the knowledge they’ve gained, encouraging their parents to buy more seafood as a result of the tasty recipes they are trying at school. O’Connor calls these “sharing chains,” in which a child’s preferences can contribute to and sometimes alter the behavior of a family group. And getting kids on board is crucial for another reason: One day these first and second graders will be adults with their own families, and hopefully they will have internalized the lessons learned in the cafeteria about local seafood and make more sustainable choices. “The creativity of how we present [the fish] and introducing it in new and interesting ways can trickle up through a community,” says O’Connor. “That’s ultimately the huge power of engaging youth in these kinds of processes — it creates this grassroots energy that will grow into a cultural consciousness where it creates norms.” Kids give high praise for the fish they tried in school. Courtesy of the Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association But shifting an entire society’s cultural norms when it comes to fresh, locally caught seafood is not without its headwinds. “With scale comes efficiency, and with efficiency comes cost savings,” explains O’Connor. “So the small-scale fishers competing with massive international, commercialized, industrialized fishing operations are always going to be at a disadvantage. When you don’t have the institutional resiliency of a large, massive operation, there’s risk.” Because there is no centralized government support for programs like Bay2Tray, a lot of pressure is put on the leaders of individual institutions to make the more values-driven choice when it comes to what ends up in the cafeteria. O’Connor, however, is confident that in time, this reluctance on the part of institutions like schools and hospitals can be overcome. “A lot of these institutions want to be able to go to their community, go to their consumer bases and say, ‘We value supporting local economies. We value sustainability in our seafood purchasing.’” Lovewell reports that Bay2Tray’s fish tacos were a hit. Courtesy of Bay2Tray Since its inception, the Bay2Tray program has managed to repurpose over 75,000 pounds of what would be considered seafood waste to serve over 88,000 healthy school lunches, a challenge in its own right considering that the average school lunch budget in California is approximately $1.25 a day per student. The program has already expanded into four additional school districts in the state, and the next phase extends all the way to the Chesapeake region, where Lovewell is training school districts to purchase and create meals out of blue catfish, a highly invasive species in the region. Coastal localities like the Bay Area and Chesapeake serve as ideal incubators for Sea-to-School programs, which are taking hold in other states as well. In Oregon, Tre-Fin Day Boat Seafood, a small day-boat operation, is supplying albacore to 12 different school districts, with the Oregon Department of Agriculture actually hiring a chef to develop recipes for the schools. The increasing number of Sea-to-School programs is in line with broader nutrition trends in public schools. Courtesy of the Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association In New England, the region is making strides with Sea-to-School programs with cooperatives like Chatham Harvesters that bring under-appreciated species like monkfish to schools’ cafeterias. Specifically in Maine, the Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association’s Fishermen Feeding Mainers (FFM), which Reasons to be Cheerful reported on in 2024, supplies locally caught fish to schools in all 16 counties of the state. Since its inception in 2020, FFM has been responsible for over 1.6 million seafood meals donated and served to hundreds of food banks and over 60 school districts in the state. Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association continues to expand its work in schools by offering resources and training to school nutrition staff and also developing ready-to-serve options that make it easy for kitchens with limited capacity to offer students healthy, local seafood. This includes options like flounder fish cakes and soups made from monkfish and pollock. In addition, MCFA has worked with the Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI) to implement a Sustainable Seafood curriculum, connecting classrooms to the cafeteria. As part of this effort to teach students about sustainability and to inspire students and cafeteria staff alike, an elementary school in Freeport, Maine, welcomed sustainable seafood expert, chef and MCFA Board member Barton Seaver, who prepared pretzel-crusted flounder for a group of hungry students. Seaver delivered a message to the students not only about the importance of including seafood in their diets but also about the significance of local seafood to the community more broadly. Whether it be the impression of a fun (and delicious) lunch with a celebrity chef or some of the educational materials MCFA provides to students, like articles published in school newsletters about what students are eating, the hope is these messages make it home with the students, strengthening the sharing chain O’Connor mentions. The increasing number of Sea-to-School programs is in line with broader nutrition trends in public schools. According to the most recent Farm-to-School census conducted by the USDA in 2023, local food, which includes locally caught seafood, is being served in over 74,000 schools across the United States, up from less than 43,000 schools a decade ago. In California, Bay2Tray’s home state, of the schools who responded to the census in 2023, 5,788,489 students benefited from locally sourced food in their cafeterias, up from 2,564,112 in 2013, which includes seafood. In Maine, that number increased from 71,575 in 2013 to 169,901 in 2023. A tuna sandwich made with fish supplied by Tre-Fin Day Boat Seafood in Oregon. Courtesy of Tre-Fin Day Boat Seafood Willow Grinell, a graduate student in the Social Oceans Lab at the University of Maine who is studying the impact of Sea-to-School programs on communities, has witnessed a lot of progress and energy, especially around the use of unwanted species like the bycatch being used by Bay2Tray: “Seeing some of these products and species go from [a situation] where no one quite knows how to prepare it in a school setting to this value-added [product] because there’s recipes and interest — that’s exciting momentum.” O’Connor believes that maintaining this momentum is possible and that the expansion of Sea-to-School programs into more states can happen with the right formula. “I do think [programs like these] provide a really exciting and effective opportunity to simplify these supply chains and bring the money back into small-scale fishing communities instead of massive, industrialized fishing economies. But it’s a really, really challenging equation to balance that requires a lot of buy-in from a lot of different stakeholders and rights holders on all sides of the equation,” he says.

Join Cancel anytime The impact of getting that equation right, though harder to calculate, has ramifications beyond a more nutritious future for kids “Making more cognizant choices about the food that is in the cafeteria basically affects the whole atmosphere and the messages that [kids are] getting,” Lovewell explains. “A lot of kids are going through a hard time at home … and [when they’re served] beautiful food that we’ve put a lot of care into — the message is, ‘You matter.’” she muses. “‘This is what fresh fish actually tastes like. This is what local supply chains taste like.’” UPDATE — August 9, 2025: This story has been updated to include more details about the Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association’s Fishermen Feeding Mainers program.

Chatter on the topic is constant. Plagerism this. Authenticity that. And if not the chatter, the unsettling sameness of content produced by coded models. Harder and harder it becomes to tell the difference between real and not real, bot created and human created. In a time obsessed with optimization and efficiency, creativity feels like it is living through a modern-era Dark Ages.And does that mean a modern-era Renaissance is on the horizon?The term of \"Dark Ages\", thought to be coined by Petrarch, (and a complex debate for another time on the simplification of the era), is a sentiment that lands for a stretch of time that felt weighed down by stagnation, loss, and the slow fade of creative and intellectual beauty. Of course, while the Dark Ages weren't entirely dark, I cannot help but feel the echos of the same sentiment today.We consume more than ever, but think less—lost in an algorithmic haze. It is the golden hour of artificial creation. And the Dark Ages of creative pursuit. Each week it seems a new tool arrives with promises of something faster, smoother, more efficient. It is thrilling at the start, to see the ease with which burdensome work is now being done. For in Petrarch's words, \"A shortcut to riches is to subtract from our desires.\" In our obsession with speed and productivity, we've distanced ourselves from the very things that make life feel alive. Outsourcing something inviolable to our very being.Subscribe nowThe stories of history parallel our very own reality as we watch the collapse of intellect and creativity at large much like it did starting in the 5th century. Very similarly to now, there was not an actual stagnation of innovation during the Middle Ages with the moniker of \"dark\", and rather was a time that saw monumental technological developments, but nonetheless a heaviness hung over the period. This softly mirrors the reality we feel today. Rather than advancements succh as gunpower and windmills, the innovation we see today is in AI—a powerful but controversial tool—bringing a wave of output with it. And the death of individuality and artistic pursuits.The times feel \"dark\" now as we see experience the decline of culture in favor of something curated and optimized, yet strangely hollow. All slightly too clean. All slightly too similar. Everywhere you look: sameness. A black plague of intellecutal stagnation spanning the globe. While no one is dying from it, we feel it. It shows up as fatigue. As disinterest. As a faint question echoing in the back of the mind: If everything can be made by a machine, why bother making anything at all?The word \"renaissance\" is defined as \"the revival of or renewed interest in something\". In a historical context, it is seen as the \"rebirth\" of culture, dawning an explosion of interlacing culture, intellect, art, and learning. So what is a renaissance if not a collective return to meaning? And is that not what we are living through now?I see it in my own inbox—a resounding desire to be more, do more, create more. I see it in the list of common chatgpt-isms. A subtle redefinition of what it means to create and consume. A refusal to let the soul and mind be automated. Less about output. More about process. Less polished, more intimate. Less about making it and more about making.The original Renaissance was a rebirth after plague and collapse and I cannot help but see history repeating itself — this plague and collapse and emergence of artistic breakthroughs. It feels like we are circling back through this strange rhythm history has. We are seeing a cultural shift in real time: one that rejects automation for intention, perfection for process, and speed for meaning.If you do not agree with me let, look at you. Here. Reading something written for the sake of writing. On this app filled with idividuals creating and sharing simply because the can and desire to. In a sense, it is a revolution agaisnt the hollowed-out version humanity has quietly slipped into. Call it what you want, but everywhere there's evidence we're craving something real.We are rediscovering what it means to create and learn. Because creation, at it's core, is human. Or maybe the other way around? It is unfolding from the ground up driven by a society that is exhausted from feeling like machines. A revolting urge to not outsource what we so innately and deeply love. I think often think, and feels the ugly spikes of resentmet, of those who are fortunate to have time and resources to pursue artistic and seemingly \"useless\" pursuits. Because is that not what we all desire? Is that not what I feel jealous so deeply it rots in my chest?The shift is emotional, cultural, and spiritual. People are talking more about rest. About boundaries. About joy not as a reward for efficiency, but as a right. It is not simply about escaping technology, but about reclaiming humanity lost inside it, swallowed whole taking us down with it into the pit of nothingness.The original renaissance was marked by return to classical knowledge, a sweep of artistic breakthrough we know and recognize today, and immersion of art and intellect as pillars of society. A turning point where people, exhausted by survival (or saturation), begin to reach for something deeper. A reawakening of wonder. So maybe we are on the brink of this, suffocated by sameness, a crack beinging to form in the structures of culture. The desire to remember what it means to be human in the act of creating.So what is a renaissance if not a collective return to meaning?

Source: YouTubeLet's be blunt. It's fair to say that, relative to other African counties, contemporary Ethiopia and Liberia have little to show for not having been colonized in the late 19th century. Having avoided the deep humiliation and diurnal horrors of colonialism, one would've expected both countries to successfully go about economic, social, and political modernization throughout the 20th century on their own terms. Instead, the two countries currently lag Continental averages in per capita income and myriad human development outcomes. They've also struggled to build coherent states that can create enabling environments for human flourishing. Therefore, in discussing how a state like Ethiopia avoided colonization in the late 19th century, it's also worth interrogating how it then managed to lag behind for much of the 20th century. This post does that. I: Learning to love and to protect sovereignty The question of how Ethiopia avoided colonization ineluctably focuses attention on the 19th century European \"scramble for Africa.\" Along these lines, everyone knows about the battle of Adwa during which an Ethiopian army famously defeated invading Italians. However, Ethiopia's ability to avoid European colonization was due to a lot more than just the ability to win a single battle. As part of the wider Nile Basin/Red Sea state system, the state had for centuries withstood external threats of conquest and domination. For example, between 1529-1543 the Adal Sultanate conquered and occupied much of Ethiopia before being repelled (with the help of the Portuguese; the Sultanate had help from the Ottomans). Perhaps more than the victory against the Italians at Adwa, the more decisive conflict for Ethiopia's avoidance of colonization was that with the Khedivate of Egypt. Had Yohannes IV lost to Ismail I in the mid 1870s, Ethiopia would have likely entered the 1880s under Egyptian rule, and therefore suffered Sudan's fate as part of an Anglo-Egyptian condominium thereafter.All this to say that Ethiopia avoided European colonization in the late 19th century due to its ability to survive (and at times thrive) within the highly competitive Nile Basin/Red Sea state system over several centuries. The accumulated history of stateness mattered a great deal in shaping the set of possible outcomes in the late 19th century.1 Internalized ideas about stateness (including its sacred origins and sense of mission to preserve it) set a high premium on sovereignty and motivated both Ethiopia's ruling elites and masses (or a section of them) to cherish and be willing to sacrifice a lot to protect their sovereignty. The history of stateness also curated important symbols of civilizational achievements (imperial conquests, culture of literacy, state religion, elite formation, monumental architecture, etc) that made the most likely successful invaders (Britain and France) to view the state as an equal of sorts, albeit one that was unusual given its geographical location (over five centuries of stories of King Prester John helped). Simply put, Ethiopia was different. Robert Napier's troops successfully marched all the way to Magdala with minimal losses and then promptly left — the British didn't consider occupying Ethiopia as important for securing Nile waters. Plus they had Egypt, Sudan, and Aden to secure logistical links to India. On their part, the French were content with securing Djibouti as a stop on the way to Indochina (especially after the Fashoda incident stopped eastward expansion of the French empire). Most importantly, stateness allowed Ethiopia to not lag too far behind (relative to European and other Red Sea states) with regard to both military technology and diplomatic relations. Due to its centuries of contact with the outside world, the Ethiopian state had the know-how to import modern firearms and military organizational structures (including advisers) and deploy them in battle against both domestic and foreign enemies. Meanwhile, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church served as a conduit for alliances with Christian Europe. And after Islam swept through northeast Africa and the wider Red Sea region, Ethiopia styled itself as a Christian outpost surrounded by a sea of \"pagans\" and Muslims (the Sudanese, Egyptians, Turks, and Horn Sultanates). Centuries of embassies in Christian Europe also enabled the curation of knowledge regarding how to manage the geopolitical dance in Horn between the Ottomans (including the Khedivate of Egypt), Britain, France, Sudan's Mahdist State, and Italy.Though not decisive to outcomes, Ethiopia also got lucky with geography (the role of geography in Ethiopia's ability to avoid foreign domination is hotly debated). To be clear, geography wasn't destiny. But on numerous occasions it granted Ethiopians important tactical advantages. Having the core of the state up in the northern highlands meant that invading armies — whether by land or from the sea — had to traverse (mostly) sparsely populated lowlands before scaling the high mountains. Having advanced notice and the ability to stage battles at narrow passes gave the Ethiopians significant advantage. Furthermore, Ethiopian's ability to lean on the terrain in deploying guerrilla tactics made it impossible for occupying forces (if it got to that) to fully impose their authority — as Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi found out in the lead up to his demise in 1543; and the Italians during their occupation: No region of Ethiopia was entirely under Italian control- manifestations of resistance occurred throughout the country. The guerrilla warriors who formed bands to undertake operations against the Italians were concentrated in the northern provinces where Amharas formed the majority of the population. Known as Patriots (Amh. Arbaiiiiyoch) these fighters became legendary during the Italian occupation and have remained so ever since. The Patriots were able to maintain almost total control of several mountainous areas where Italian forces could only penetrate temporarily but could never predominate.2Subscribe nowThe state's overall economic geography was also favorable to maintaining sovereignty even when surrounded by enemies. Being a largely agrarian inland empire that wasn't particularly reliant on seaborne trade meant that the state was resilient to the loss of ports like Massawa on the (would-be) Eritrean coast. Indeed, successive foreign occupiers of Massawa and other outlets (like Suakin, Tajura, Zeila, and later Djibouti and Assab) found themselves having to sue for peace with the Ethiopian state in order to serve as its gateway to international markets (the more things change...)Ethiopia's other bit of (earned) luck was in timing. First, for the purposes of repelling European colonialism, Emperor Menelik II (1889 to 1913) — a modernizing and expansionist state-builder with a brilliant politician for a wife (Empress Taytu) — was the right emperor at the right time:Throughout his reign, as king and as emperor Menelik recognized the value of modern weaponry for internal and external political purposes. No slave to tradition, he made use of the new military technology brought into Ethiopia by an ever-growing stream of Europeans. As emperor, he was quick to apprehend the threat of Italian domination and realized that it could be fought only with its own weapons. He marshalled the resources of his empire and acted as a national statesman. His perspicacity saved Ethiopia from militant European imperialism, and his sage diplomacy consolidated and guaranteed the empire's sovereignty for at least one generation beyond his death in 1913.3A depiction of Emperor Menelik II monitoring proceedings at the Battle of Adwa in 1896. Empress Taytu was also in attendance. Source: WikipediaSecond, the European \"scramble for Africa\" happened at the tail end of about a century of war and discord among the kingdoms and principalities within the empire (Zemene Mesafint, Era of the Princes). During this period, real power left the Nəgusä Nägäst (king of kings) and spread to the heads of the empire's constituent kingdoms and principalities. It's extremely unlikely that the titular emperors of the late Gondarine and Zemene Mesafint eras would've rallied enough subnational units towards the defense of the empire. For example, a counterfactual in which the Yejju rases were the ones rallying the empire against a foreign invasion — even under the great Ras Gugsa — would've probably yielded a different outcome. Consolidation of imperial authority — which began in fits and starts under Tewodros II (1855-1868) — made it possible for Menelik II to tie the last remaining loose ends and face the expected Italian invasion with a unified imperial army:Menelik's deployment showed that Ethiopia now had fewer and weaker dissidents, and that the neguse negest was essentially in full control for the first time since the sixteenth century. Regional 'masters', like ordinary soldiers, actually went on the expedition with the single purpose of repelling an external attack, looking to Menelik for leadership. They were keen to show their warriorhood and leadership qualities of networking, coordination and command of social support. Individual warriors were ready to show off their skills in horsemanship and daring actions, and their grooms and pages looking after their war materials, tents and pack animals hoped to attract attention as fighters as well.4And then there was the magnificent symbolism of Adwa — which definitively settled the question of whether Ethiopia would be colonized.5 In hindsight, Ethiopia's victory on March 1, 1896 almost looks inevitable. Starting with the battle of Amba Alagi and the siege of Mekelle, Menelik II's tactical and strategic genius was on full display. The methodical northward advance and avoidance of unnecessary battles forced the Italians to march to his tune. This strategy was aided along by Italian impatience. Barely 26 years old, the newly unified Kingdom of Italy was in a hurry to be counted among European imperial powers. Orders from Rome forced Oreste Baratieri — who had the added problem of leading generals who were his social superiors and therefore disrespected him — to confront the Ethiopian military in a manner and at a time not of his choosing (although to be fair, he was never going to find an ideal time or location for battle). To complicate matters, the Italian generals' spatial confusion and mixing up of place names meant that they couldn't station their armies properly ahead of the battle. Thus the Italian troops stumbled into battle in the early hours of the morning after marching all night. Their lack of spatial awareness left different units divided and unable to get reinforcements once the fighting started.Overall, it did not help matters that the Italians, having been distracted by campaigns in Somalia, were insufficiently attuned to both the degree of patriotism and military advancements in Ethiopia. As a result, they made two important miscalculations:[they] underestimated the quality of Menelik's troops and counted on help from the insurgent rases [nobles/princes]. This did not materialize. Menelik had in September 1895 issued a proclamation about the foreign menace which raised a wave of genuine patriotism among the tribes. It brought all his vassals to his side, and the army with which he awaited the Italian invasion included his own Shoan soldiers, the Harar troops under the faithful Ras Makonnen, Ras Mangasha's men from Tigré, the Gojjam army, and the Galla cavalry.6That said, the deciding factor in Adwa — just like for much of the late 19th century — was that the Ethiopians were militarily and politically prepared. The rearming with modern weapons had gone well, at times with help from the Italians (when both sides were pretending to adhere to the treaty of Wuchale). And having maneuvered to get all the important regional players on his side, Emperor Menelik II had assembled a multiethnic imperial army that reflected his achievement of imperial control to a degree that had eluded his predecessors for centuries. His ability to effectively model the empire's sense of mission meant that Ethiopia would remain free in the age of empire.... well, until early 1937. Subscribe nowII: The grave consequences of missing the modernization boat in the early 20th century Why did Ethiopia lag behind economically, politically (and ultimately militarily) in the 20th century given its seemingly new trajectory following the reigns of Tewodros II, Yohannes IV, and Menelik II? The simple answer is that Ethiopia failed to sufficiently modernize its economy, politics, and society. In this regard, Ethiopia wasn't unique on the African Continent. An important explanation for African underdevelopment over the last two centuries is that most of the Continent's societies failed to modernize on their own terms. Most failed because they missed the Early Modern developments in the organizational means (e.g., stateness, traditions of literacy and organized mass learning, elite ideological and socio-cultural hegemony, etc) to import and adapt emerging technologies of government (e.g. constitutionalism) economic output (scientific rationality, jointly-owned inter generational large firms, optimally structured property rights), and defense (military technology). These two texts should be read together. Walter Rodney does an excellent job in reminding everyone of the exploitative elements of Africa's encounter with Europe. On his part, Olufemi Taiwo offers an antidote to that tragedy, and reminds us all that the last 250 years were not at all inevitable. His other works (see here and here) also remind us that Africa must modernize if it is to break free of the humiliating horrors of the last 500 years.With that in mind, it's worth pointing out that an important lesson that those who only superficially read Walter Rodney miss is that it is the lagging behind on modernization that set the stage for the humiliating experiences under colonial and neo-colonial exploitation of the last 200 years. Therefore, it is important to read Rodney not exclusively as a moralizing polemicist (as preferred by most), but as an attempt at positive description of how African weaknesses in the Early Modern era — when everyone was adopting new technologies of government and mastery of the physical world — enabled subsequent humiliation and dispossession by foreigners.For example, Rodney explicitly observes that productive technological transfer from Eurasia in the early modern era could have happened if there were African socio-economic structures capable of making use of that technology and internalizing it. From an African perspective, it follows that the way to correct the accumulated mistakes of history on the Continent cannot be the standard perennial moralizing in the hope of changing foreigners' character; while using Africans (cast as noble victims of history, of course) as a foil in self-indulgent political projects. Instead, what's needed is a fair amount of internal reflection regarding when and why the proverbial rain started beating the region, followed by investments in the means of maximizing African agency on the world stage. That is the only way that African states and societies will be able to thrive on the grand stage of history on their own terms, and not predominantly feature as side plots in others' history. Which brings us back to Ethiopia. Why wasn't aggressive modernization on the cards, especially after Adwa earned the empire recognition among the community of independent states? Subscribe nowFour main reasons come to mind. First, the military successes in the late 19th century against both domestic and foreign adversaries lulled core imperial elites into thinking that they'd always be able to buy military technology; and not have to invest in a (dual use) domestic industrial base (and all that was required in terms of social, political, and economic reforms):The ease with which Menelik had obtained weapons led Ethiopians to conclude that the nation would always be able to purchase war supplies from eager salesmen. The leadership did not consider it necessary to build up an arms industry, with all the modernization and reorganization of society that such an effort would involve, but was content to foster the development of government and the traditional economy through the introduction of communications such as the railway, telephone, and telegraph. Competent and responsible Ethiopians could not foresee that defence costs would rise astronomically after the First World War; that the complexity of the new arms systems would require soldiers with a relatively high level of technical understanding; and that the changing political alliances and relationships of Europe would sharply reduce the availability of arms. Haile Sellasie I, therefore, found it impossible to defend his country against the mechanized Italian army; his illiterate soldiery could not fully exploit even the few modern weapons he had been able to acquire.7And so when Fascist Italy came in the late 1930s to avenge Adwa, it found Ethiopia with less than 5 tanks, a joke of an Air Force, no radio communication, and generally technologically backward. Despite countless instances of individual valor and sense of mission to preserve Ethiopian sovereignty, collectively the empire was completely outmatched by the fascists. Second, the emergent post-Adwa legitimation strategy — southward territorial expansion — hogged imperial attention at the expense of intensive modernization. Crucially, this clouded Ethiopian elite's understanding of the urgent need for far-reaching reforms of the economy, politics, and social relations. For example, except for the railway to Djibouti and road links to Somalia, there was no investment in a national road network under Menelik II — including within the northern highlands! Basically, Emperor Menelik II was too distracted by imperial expansion and was bad at policy comms: Menelik was a type belonging rather to the western business world, a pure-bred, hard-headed entrepreneur. He was keenly interested in foreign affairs, and his knowledge of the developments of European progress is commented on by almost every foreign visitor to his court. He even had advanced ideas about social reform, and decreed the abolition of slavery, the introduction of compulsory education, and the substitution of a new code for the old customary law. No doubt these would have been more effective had he personally supervised their execution ; as it was, he was usually too busy consolidating his frontiers; few of his subjects grasped the significance of his ideas, and any benefits derived from the changes lapsed in the turbulent years of his illness and of Lij Jasu's short, eventful reign.8With hindsight, things might have turned out differently if Menelik II and Tewodros II had swapped places in time. Despite his shaky grasp of foreign policy (see the debacle at Magdala), the latter had the right instincts on industrialization and would've likely accelerated Ethiopia's modernization by being a better imperial ally to the early 20th century \"Japanization\" policy coalition within the elite class.Third, with a deep and storied history comes the heavy weight of conservatism. Under the circumstances, it takes a lot of skill to modernize a society without breaking it. This is something that Haile Selassie, despite flashes here and there, simply couldn't do. The church was too slow to move on modernization — which severely hampered the state's ability to roll out modern mass education. Land reform was not on the cards, with the semi-feudal agrarian economy surviving into the 20th century mostly intact. Despite centuries of a culture of elite literacy, there was virtually no human capital base for rapid industrialization. As late as 1941 Ethiopia's literacy rate was barely 5%. While many Ethiopian elites could get a decent education, real mass education did not arrive until the 2000s. Ethiopia entered the 21st century with an astonishingly low adult literacy rate of 36%. Ominously, by mid-century the shoots of aid dependency were already visible:During the remainder of the 1950s, with the help of foreign governments and advisers of several nationalities, five more colleges were established. Under USAID funding, the University of Oklahoma first set up an agricultural school at Jimma in 1953 and then opened an agricultural college at Alemaya near Harar in 1956. A public health college sponsored by UN agencies and USAID was opened at Gondar in 1954. In the same year the Swedish government founded a building technology institute in Addis Ababa. The two-year engineering college that began operation in Addis Ababa in 1952 was intended to be a faculty of Haile Selassie I University (HSIU) for which planning had already begun.9In may ways, Emperor Selassie's developmentalist strategies were inferior to his 19th century predecessors. Perhaps motivated by the desire to develop fast, or (more likely) a naive belief in the benevolence of foreigners (despite his experience with the Italians), Emperor Selassie did not embody a commitment to do things on Ethiopia's terms. Part of the problem was that he, like all African elites at the time, was cross-pressured by tradition (and its sources of power and authority) and popular demands for rapid modernization. And like most African elites, Selassie avoided the difficult task of reconciling the two forces. Instead, he chose a schizophrenic existence of mostly outsourcing the modernization drive (and thinking behind it) to foreigners, while clinging to traditional sources of power and authority. This schizophrenic posture was a disaster. Consider education policy: On the severe material and human shortcomings was grafted an educational policy that lacked direction and national objectives. According to many scholars, the main reason for the lack of a national direction is to be found in the decisive role that foreign advisors, administrators, and teachers played in the establishment and expansion of Ethiopia's education system. That the curriculum tended to reflect at all levels courses offered in Western countries was a glaring proof of their harmful influence. As one author puts it, \"appointed foreign advisors tended to think that what had proved successful in their countries would also benefit Ethiopian development\".Finally, the imperial politics of ethnic exclusion (especially following the southern expansion) limited the spread of state authority and developmentalist investments in all Ethiopians. The core state elites remained fairly insular and chauvinistic vis-a-vis non-coethnics in the empire. This, in itself, reflected ignorance of history. Ethnic inclusion (even if coerced at the time) had produced Lalibela and the Yejju dynasty which preserved some semblance of imperial authority. In end, the system's exclusionary rigidity led to the rise of the nationalisms of the 1960s-1970s, eventual overthrow of the emperor, and civil war. Contemporary Ethiopia — with its ethnicity-based subnational units — is still paying for the mistake of failing to invest in nation-building through inclusive modernization.III: Conclusion There is no deep mystery about political and economic underdevelopment on the African Continent. At a fundamental level, the story is one of repeated failures at critical junctures of history to develop mechanisms of organizing and protecting productive economic activity at scale. The resulting lag relative to other regions then yielded compounding effects over time. And in my view, the biggest driver of these regional failures to keep up has been the absence of historical self-awareness among Africa's ruling elites. This reality has resulted in elites losing hegemonic legitimacy vis-a-vis their own people, having diminished agency on the world stage, and totally lacking in ambition. Given their important role in coordinating collective action and enforcing the norms that animate institutions, it's impossible to go far with low-ambition elites.With this in mind, the history of Ethiopia in the late 19th century teaches us what a sense of national mission — especially if modeled well by ambitious elites — can achieve. Ethiopia's failure to build on Adwa and its rich history in the 20th century is also instructive. Lagging the rest of the world with regard to social, political, and economic development — as is currently happening in much of the Continent — leaves the region's societies exposed to the specter of humiliating foreign dependence and exploitation for generations to come. In order to create an enabling environment for their people to flourish and to safeguard African agency on the world stage, African societies must focus on rapidly and unapologetically modernizing on their own terms. It is as simple as that.A statue of Emperor Menelik II in Addis Ababa. Source: WikimediaIn the final analysis, men like Menelik II and many members of the Independence Generation deserve credit for doing so much with so little. They were imperfect, for sure, and made their share of mistakes. But one cannot honestly fault them for lacking historical self-awareness, sense of mission, or ambition. In this regard they were heads and shoulders above the current crop of African leaders who, despite their relatively much richer (human capital) endowments, are arguably the most complacent ruling elites in the world.

He doesn't actually say this as such, but I think it's something that you could legitimately draw out of his ideas. The prohairesis is kind of a bundle of habits, among other things, and those habits are generated in kind of an Aristotelian way, by doing the same thing in similar circumstances.He says exactly that in in a few parts of the Discourses. He also gives us a lot of advice about, if you want to break a habit, well you've got to push over to the other extreme. He uses the metaphor of a ship that's kind of tilted to the side, and if you want it to tilt over, you've got to push it further over to the other side. Interestingly, although the only things he says about Aristotelians is that they're basically like not as bad as Epicureans but pretty close, Epictetus certainly says a lot of things that sound pretty consistent with the Aristotelian conception of virtue ethics. By doing the same thing over and over again, we generate habits. We have got to be really careful too. Once we've got a bad habit — this may gross people out a little bit — he talks about like with anger, the habit that you've generated is sort of like having scar tissue from being whipped, and then he says if you're giving into it once, you know that you've already got a habit, that's sort of like that goes beyond just welts and becomes wounds in your body. But imagine in your soul. It's more and more damaging as time goes on, coming close to what we nowadays call trauma, which I think is a big challenge for virtue ethics. So we we have to be quite cognizant of the habits that we have.And there's another really important feature of what he has to say about habits. So at any moment when we're tempted to do something on the basis of a bad habit, of a vicious habit, we usually have a line of reasoning that goes like this. It will say: \"Oh it's not a big deal because I'm only doing it in this one instance, you know. Normally I wouldn't have a midnight snack, but I just gave a good presentation, so I get to indulge myself\" Or: \"Normally I wouldn't have lost my temper, but that person was a complete jackass, and they they had it coming\"And what we don't realize is that at every moment we have this little tiny bit of freedom to improve ourselves or to to backslide, and abandoning this habit, this sort of meta-habit of excusing ourselves when it comes to bad habits, that's an important part of moral Improvement. Paying attention to each situation that we're getting ourselves in, and and not making excuses for ourselves, as we're tempted to do, which is an affective thing. We already have a habit, a tendency of making excuses, and there may be all sorts of other people giving us bad advice: \"Oh it's okay for you to do this.\" So yeah, this dimension of habit is absolutely important for moral development for for Epictetus, and I would say for the Stoics in general. I mean how do you get to be a good person, a virtuous person? You think about their their four cardinal virtues, wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. Sometimes they're portrayed as if you either have one or you don't, and there's no in between. But I think that that's certainly not there in Epictetus. Seneca sometimes says stuff like that, but then he contradicts himself later on about the importance of changing things gradually.So I see another question from Sonia. That's a great question about how we become aware of our own vices, things that we need to fix about ourselves. So sometimes, she asked, is it because of our the bad consequences? Yeah sometimes it is. I get angry and then I get fired from a job, or somebody doesn't fire me, but human resources sends me to mandatory anger-management classes, and now I'm aware that I have a problem that I need to work on.And actually when I go into the anger management class, I'm probably resistant the way most people are in the first couple sessions. They're like: \"All these other people, they've got a problem, not me!\" But you know, after a while you come to see that, nah you're not that different than everybody else. So so now we're already moving from consequences that you don't like to seeing that you aren't that exceptional. And I think he just does talk about this. You complain, he says at one point (I don't remember exactly where this is), about other people and their own screwed up behavior, but what about you buddy? Aren't you like that yourself? Marcus also says that to himself as well, and then I think we talked about this a little bit earlier in a passage that I brought up. Contradictions or conflicts, most of us are are not completely consistent right? Epictetus himself cops to that. Do we get bothered by our inconsistencies? So sometimes this could be outside people coming in and saying: \"You know, you criticize these people over here but you yourself do this\", or \"I don't like when you behave this way, you need to look at this.\" And sometimes it's ourselves realizing the contradictions that we've got ourselves. We're like: \"Holy crap! My life is a mess. I need to start fixing.\" But this is a kind of an interesting side note, and this gets away from Epictetus into thinking about moral development more generally. You see that with a lot of people, and I can say this from my own experience, and also a lot of theorists throughout history, particularly the monastic writers, that the first problem that we identify usually isn't the main problem. We see something, and we're like: \"Oh, this is messed up. I need to work on this.\" And then we start digging into it, and then we're like: \"Oh there's even bigger things down below.\" It's sort of like walking into somebody's house, where you're supposed to do a little bit of light carpentry to help them with their window. Actually when I was a kid, we worked on a place like this. My uncle and I were supposed to paint a house, and as we're painting the house, we realized that there were boards that were rotting because they're coming apart as we're painting it. And we're like we're gonna have to replace these boards. And then he actually taught me how to glaze windows, because some of the windows had to be replaced, and it turned into this gigantic project. That's usually the way it works for us when we're engaged in moral development. You get sent to anger management, and you're like: \"Yeah, I'm gonna learn how to be cool for a while,\" and then you're like: Oh, I'm angry because everybody in my family yells at each other all the time. I need to like work on this stuff.\" So maybe to go back to your your original question, how are we motivated to to improve ourselves, maybe the motivation can't happen all at once for most of us, because we're more screwed up than we than we realize we are. I mean, I know that's certainly the case for me. I suspect that's probably the case for most people. It's not as if we can like do a scientific study of this.Any other questions or things you want to talk more about? Here we go: I heard there are different reasonings. It's up to you depending on how you choose. But how does the remedy of reasoning come in how, knowing the other person's reasoning process can somehow change or correct mine? So there's a lot of ways. There could be the mirroring thing that we were talking about. You see somebody else making really foolish arguments and you're like: \"Holy crap! I'm glad I'm not like those dummies over there!\" And then you realize: \"Oh wait a second. I am like those dummies over there.\" And so seeing other people's bad reasonings could somehow provoke you to realize your own mistaken reasonings.Sometimes we we start paying attention to our reasonings, because somebody whose opinion we value tells us we need to stop screwing up like we're screwing up. And this this could be, like in my case, I'm very fortunate in that I have a a great wife who is very smart, smarter than me, quite perceptive, and is pretty willing to call me out on stuff. But it could be a good friend. It could be a teacher or a mentor. It could be, if you're lucky enough to get a good psychologist, or life coach, or somebody else who digs into these sorts of things, it might be that. So that's a second way. They they actually say you need to start thinking about this in the course of psychotherapy. People, depending on what kind of modality they're pursuing, they often lexplore their own processes of reasoning, and try to look for different biases or blank spots where they're missing something, or mistaken lines of reasoning, or stuff like thatWhat else? Epictetus actually is a great model for this. Every point in his works where he says \"have this ready at hand\" or \"in a situation like this be ready to say to yourself\", those are lines of reasoning that he's offering to us, right? I mean this is a bit of a digression, but originally there were eight books of the Discourses, and we've lost four of those apparently. But that was just Arrian studying with Epictetus for a space of like two to three years, and then writing stuff down. Imagine if we had video recordings and they were of course translated from ancient Koine Greek into to our languages, of Epictetus actually teaching. How many conversations he would have had. How many places where he would have said \"when you're in a situation like this, try this out\", \"when you're doing this, try this out\". That's, I think part of the effect of his own teaching.We have similar things with Seneca. Seneca writes these letters to Lucius, and he writes some letters of consolation ,and he writes some treatises, and he often says similar things, where he's like \"when you get into a situation like this, try to look at things this way\", or \"try to think about these these ideas\". So those are remedies of reasoning. Now how effective are they? I mean it depends on the person. It depends on their willingness to actually listen to it. It's not as if you just throw the right reasoning in front of somebody, and they accept the coinage and they're like a vending machine, where you put in the money and you push the button and then the soda, or candy, or chips comes out. We're more complicated than that. And you can kind of work on people over a while. Gareth it looks like you've got a question as well. So there's a couple interesting things there in your question. Let me try to split them apart from each other, and let's talk about the Ship of Theseus thing first. So the Ship of Theseus, everyone's familiar with that, right? Theseus starts sailing. He's got to replace things along the way. At the end, every single piece of the ship has been replaced. Is it the same ship? Well that's the way that the Stoics basically look at the human psyche. If reason is just a system of appearances, then you can swap things out in and out all the time. I guess you could say, it kind of matters what kind of appearances they are maybe. And similarly with changing habits, what you're doing in the prohairesis in modifying it by the choices that you're making is you're you're swapping some bits out, and swapping some other bits out, right? And there may be some that are harder to move. If you have some, we I mentioned the word trauma a little bit earlier. I think that one of the big challenges for virtue ethics in general is taking adequate account of the traumas that, by the time that we're adults were we're stuck with, and often prove much more intractable to modification or fixing than the other parts of ourselves. But even those, you can gradually replace those those reactions, and reframe memories and things like that. The hypothesis thing is quite interesting, as far as the indifferents. So there's two things to say. One is one is in direct response to your question: are there actions that are indifferent? Yes, and the Stoics actually give examples of them, like is your finger bent, or is it straight? Straightening your finger, bending your finger, who cares? It doesn't matter. Now if I take my glasses off, and I my fingers bent and then it's straight, and I poke myself in the eye, suddenly it assumes some importance, right? So there could be a lot of things that, I guess you could say, in themselves are indifferent actions, but when we put them into a framework.A prime example: giving somebody the middle finger. Maybe you're just counting, but it could also turn into a gesture, that's showing defiance. When I was a kid, I actually had this finger crushed in a door, and I didn't know what the middle finger meant, and so the older kids were all like \"Hey, show us that injured finger!\" And then I'm like: \"Here it is.\" And then I got in trouble with the the teachers. It was in third grade. So some things that in themselves are indifferent within certain contexts could have value. If you think about what we count as money, now that's not about actions but that's more about other stuff. grew up in a time when cash was important, and people would write checks, and then credit cards were a rarity. And now there's a lot of places where you can't even use cash. And there's all sorts of other things that we never dreamed of like Apple pay, or Google pay, or things like that. What counts as money is kind of an indifferent in itself, but when you want to buy a hamburger, it's no longer quite so indifferent to you. It doesn't have the value that makes you virtuous or vicious but it's important.The third thing to say about the indifferents is the Stoics don't think that we should be indifferent to all of the indifferents, but that using them well or dealing with them well is important. In fact, as Epictetus says, something could be indifferent but our use of it is not indifferent, and it is within our control, and it is a matter of the prohairesis. So how I use my money — money itself is an indifferent — but how I use my money is not. I can use it virtuously or viciously. And there's all sorts of other things like that as well within that that realm. We could say that about bad things too, like how do I use my sickness. I'm still suffering from some effects of covid. Do I use it rather cynically as an excuse to get out of doing work? That's vicious. Do I need to pay attention to certain things, so I don't over exert myself, then wind up being too tired to fulfill my obligations. That's more of a virtuous way of dealing with indifferents of of the body, and illness, and stuff like that I see another question from Sonia. So the you're asking about, what the stoics would call virtuous or vicious actions, and then appropriate or inappropriate actions, or duties and what's contrary to duty. The stoics thought they have a very robustly developed virtue ethics, and there's these four cardinal virtues, and each of the virtues has subdivisions. And so you you can say that there are some things that are the right thing to do within almost all circumstances. You take for example Seneca in On Anger, he says: Do you need to get angry in order to prevent your father from being murdered? And he says: No, you don't. You can do that being motivated by courage, or just by right practical reasoning, because you should keep your father from being murdered. And then you can say: Well yeah, but what if your father's Hitler? Or what if your father's Nero? You know, a person who needs killing. Okay, well that's a little bit different. But in most circumstances it's pretty easy to identify protecting life as as the right thing to do, as the just thing to do, a courageous thing to do. There are going to be some tricky cases, and then we want to use prudence as much as we can. Prudence as the Stoics define it is the capacity or the knowledge of what is good for us, what is bad for us, being able to work through processes of weighing these things, and all of that. So we might need some adjuncts. It's not just responding immediately in the circumstances, but I think that's where we we look at the other things that they have to say. Not that they're going to provide us with perfect guidance about every single circumstance. They also do think the motivation matters. If you're doing something that would generally be seen as a virtuous action, but you're doing it motivated because you want to have everybody look at you and say \"wow what a great person!\", as we call it over here being a \"big shot\", that changes the action. It's virtuous and it's good in some respects, but it's bad in other respects. But Aristotle says that too, and Plato says that too.Plato in the Phaedo distinguishes what most people think of as courage from philosophical courage. You run into the burning building because you're afraid of looking like you're scared of the fire? That's not courage according to Plato. You're just transferring one fear to another. So I think this is kind of a common thing in virtue ethics. Aristotle has this this great discussion of acting from virtue because you've actually got the virtue, and then just acting in accordance with virtue being self-controlled, and he says they're both good. One's way better than the other. We could say similar things with vicious behavior The Stoics will define this primarily in terms of — I mean here's one place where I totally disagree with the Stoics — they've got this whole notion of the sage, the perfect person, and only the perfect person can do perfectly good actions. They call those katorthomata as opposed to kathēkonta. The kathēkonta is often translated as actions in accordance with duty or appropriate actions. They're the right thing to do, but they don't have a perfect motivation behind them, whereas the sage, this legendary person who we don't even know if they ever existed — and Epictetus says, \"I'm not a sage,\" by the way — with them the motivational structure is completely perfect I think this is not a very helpful thing. It often discourages people, because they're like: \"I can never be completely good\". But we could probably set that aside, the sage conception. I mean, if Epictetus thought anybody was a sage, it was Socrates, Diogenes, and Zeno, and when you look at all three of them and the stories that we have about them, they don't seem perfect people. Socrates, sure he was a great philosopher, but he is also a terrible father. Diogenes seems more like a jerk than a perfect \"herald of God\", as the cynics like to call themselves all the time. And Xeno actually was afraid to carry a pot of lentils across the marketplace. So they all had flaws, but each of them had their their roles. As Epictetus says, each of them did their their work. I think that's the best we can probably aim for.I'll say one other thing too in response to your question. We probably need other people to be involved with us, to call us out on our BS, when we think that we're doing perfectly good stuff, and we've advanced, and we're at the pinnacle of goodness. We probably need other people in the background to say: \"Oh no, you're not quite so good. You still have some work to do on yourself.\"So she says \"I want to ask about coherence\". I think that was mentioned at the very beginning in the title\".I don't have coherence in the title. Character is the the c-word in the title. But you can say that that for the Stoics, and again not uniquely, coherence — our ideas, and our actions, and our character being coherent as opposed to being contradictory, or in conflict with each other — that's really important. I think that's that's a place where you could say that virtue ethics intersects with with psychotherapy, and with other things as well, because we do want to be generally coherent in the things that we desire and commit to, and and prioritize and choose to do. And we want that coherence to be, you could say, one that's oriented towards the good, because I suppose you could be more or less coherently evil in some respect. I mean you would be incoherent on other levels for the Stoics, but there are some examples of people who seem to be very well developed in doing evil. So coherence, that's something that Epictetus talks about with just a single term, but you could say that that is something in the background for Stoic ethics in general. The whole idea of living in accordance. \"In accordance\" is translating several different Greek terms, one of which is harmonia which is definitely like concordance or or coherence. So yeah I think that's that's a good thing to highlight. Well again thanks so much for for having me here! I very much enjoyed spending this time with you and I hope that I hope the handouts are are helpful for you.

      "content": "In this issue: learnings from the first month of our Special Interest Group on Protocols for Business. From the importance of conflict to ideas from basketball and bear management. Brackish (adjective): a mix of saltwater and freshwater, at once quenching and sapping. Sodium is a dual-action nutrient. On the one hand you need salts like sodium and potassium to rehydrate effectively. On the other hand, too much salt will pull the water out of cells — and can be deadly.In 2005, Blue Ocean Strategy hit the shelves of airport bookstores and business schools. Its authors urged firms to escape cutthroat \"red oceans\" by creating new, uncontested markets. If there was ever a sign that conflict-avoidant tendencies had saturated the minds of managers, that was it. An executive who fears clashes with competitors is like an ultramarathon runner who's scared of his salt. Trade-offs, arguments, competition, and tensions are necessary parts of corporate life.In other words, there are no blue oceans. Only blue kiddie pools.Last month, Summer of Protocols kicked off three special interest groups (SIGs) – one on memory, one on formal theories, and one on protocols for business (P4B). I host the SIGP4B call every other Monday, which you can join on Discord.This group studies a few overarching questions: How do businesses use protocols? Could they use them better? What can we gain by seeing an organization as a series of protocols?Simple, but not simplistic questions. The impetus for this group was an ongoing thread of research in protocol studies called tensions, which we define as a trade-off plus a conflict. Businesses not only make constant trade-offs between things like efficiency and thoroughness; they also navigate conflicts that stem from those trade-offs — internally, with partners, between teams, and among stakeholders.Protocols are a tool to manage tensions between different individuals, teams, or groups. Safety protocols balance security and productivity. Data management protocols negotiate different preferences for privacy and freedom. Meeting protocols, like Robert's Rules of Order, govern the flow of information between decision makers through a cascade of debates and agreements.What are the patterns that make these protocols so effective? So far, we've spotted a few promising threads. First and foremost, it's clear that using protocols effectively will require a brackish strategy that straddles worlds of peacemaking (freshwater) and of bloody competition (saltwater). A kind of strategic field guide that helps professionals build the capacity to be both streetfighters and diplomats, to be both engineers and marketers, rather than shying away from one dimension of the job. \"Protocols are neither state nor market, but essential to both.\"- David Lang, Standards Make the WorldWe'll also continue to study the idea of tensions. Many folks have already made inroads to this idea-space under different names: paradox, polarity, both/and thinking, ambidexterity, wicked problem, parallax. We hope not to replace that work but rather to work towards a complementary, empirical study of these phenomena.And who do I mean by we? The SIGP4B is a seriously diverse group of professionals, whose jobs include video game design, consulting, construction management, DAO stewardship, constitution-writing, engineering, occupational health, and economic theory. Below are some case studies we've discussed and some more ideas that have cropped up along the way.Showdown at Apple, RevisitedThe canonical Jobs-Sculley split is usually told as a melodrama of personalities. Jobs was a young, insurgent creative. Sculley was a disciplined moneymaker. After the Apple board allowed that creative tension to escalate into a brutal ultimatum (\"It's me or him\"), they exiled Jobs. A costly period of calm followed as the dominance of the Apple II product line pushed the company's innovative streak, and therefore its long-term prospects, to the periphery.We started with this case study because it eventually ended happily. Apple resurrected itself through a deliberate orchestration of conflict. Aesthetics and performance were revitalized in concert with supply chain discipline. Jobs returned, shaking things up, and Tim Cook crushed unit costs. What the Apple board originally did wrong they eventually did right. At first they sought to give Jobs and Sculley each their own uncontested space — product and operations, respectively. It worked out better when they surfaced the productive fight within the firm and redirected it toward a compounding advantage.Hybrid Logic at Lloyd's of LondonA recent ethnographic study of Lloyd's of London's reinsurance market demonstrates how even century-old institutions can convert endemic tensions into a stable engine of collective performance. Smets, Jarzabkowski, Burke, and Spee identify three micro-level balancing mechanisms: segmenting, bridging, and demarcating. Through those, underwriters shuttle between a communal \"subscription\" ethos and firm-specific profit imperatives.Segmenting spatially decouples practices: actuarial modelling occurs in private offices, while reciprocal horse-trading is confined to the public \"box.\" Bridging selectively carries information or favours across that divide, releasing complementarities without erasing boundary distinctions.Demarcating reinscribes limits via peer ridicule, risk-review rituals, or self-monitoring to prevent drift toward either pure communalism or unbridled market opportunism.The cyclical interplay of these mechanisms sustains what the authors term a \"conflicting-yet-complementary\" equilibrium — practices anchored in one logic augment, rather than dilute, the value generated under the other￼.Lloyd's might exemplify a brackish institutional design in which antagonistic currents are neither blended into homogeneity nor kept in hermetic isolation, but continually re-balanced to preserve both liquidity and discipline.Subscribe nowOnly OpeningsFrank Chimero's parable of the wolves and the bears is evergreen. You can solve problems or you can manage them. Some designers prefer solutions — like those who crafted the policy of wolf extermination that led to a trophic cascade in Yellowstone. Like Jobs, those wolves were eventually reintroduced.Some designers prefer to manage problems. Our protocols at national parks are made to reduce bear-human interactions, without reducing the population of either party. The logic of Only Openings is like a strange variant of chess where there are no endgames. We play only in a perpetual middlegame. As it happens, one reigning operating principle for middlegame play in chess is to keep the tension. It's mathematically easier to build an advantageous position when there are more pieces on the board — the web of their potential interactions is the raw material of your strategy.Chess is not life, but the parallel is too rich to dismiss. Organizations are also stuck in a perpetual middlegame — what many refer to as an infinite game. Teams within an organization operate with conflicting logics (the shrewd accountants versus the eclectic marketers). Organizations, from businesses to governments, profit by keeping healthy diplomatic channels open. You win by keeping the game — and all of its bloody conflicts — going, not by winning the game. The Heresy of Zone DefenseZone defense was illegal in the NBA until the 2001–2002 season, despite its effectiveness. Why? Spectators hated it. Tension triads between basketball spectators, players, and managers are a rich case study. Furthermore, zone defense itself might be a profitable lens through which we can reexamine our organizations. The Anna Karenina Principle, distilled from this (translated) Tolstoy quote — \"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" — states that a deficiency in any one of a number of factors dooms an endeavor to failure. Consequently, a successful endeavor is one for which every possible deficiency has been avoided.When we imagine an organization as a field of tensions, it resembles an enormous team playing zone defense. Each division is responsible for guarding against a particular problem: bankruptcy, loss of trust, indemnity, irrelevance, stagnation, low morale, fraud, workplace accidents, declining market share, etc. This analogy is a good first step toward a useful protocol-based org chartSubject to the Anna Karenina Principle, any successful business is one where major internal and external tensions are adequately managed. A healthy organization is brackish by nature — full of conflict, but also optionality and potential.Help Formulate a Brackish StrategyThere are three ways to catch this rising tide.

Missed the stream? Here's your catch-up. \"A lot has changed in the world of climate protocols over the past few years. In 2023, when I last presented a talk on the current state of affairs to the SoP community, the worlds of DeFi and traditional carbon markets had recently fully collided, with questionable results leaving both sides of the table trying to pick up the pieces in the years to follow. Regen Network, where I was working at the time, had been broadening focus out of carbon and into other environmental markets such as biodiversity crediting - an area that has seen strong engagement from both UNDP and UN Environment Programme with initiatives like the Biodiversity Crediting Alliance. Meanwhile, traditional carbon markets (consisting mostly of reforestation and avoided deforestation credits) continued to face strong headwinds, both from a plummeting in corporate demand after the Guardian's exposé in early 2023, as well as continued slow progress on instrumentalizing Article 6 of the Paris Agreement — a key piece of international climate protocol puzzle that aims to clarify how voluntary carbon market credits will be treated in the context of jurisdictional national climate commitments.As a response to this crisis, a small corner of the carbon markets has been gaining traction in both the regulatory and corporate sustainability worlds – that of \"durable carbon-dioxide removal\". In many ways this renewed focus on more permanent carbon removal and storage technologies (often abbreviated CDR), is an attempted rebranding of carbon markets – away from greenwashing and questionable \"counterfactual claims\" of avoidance based credits, and towards scientifically verifiable removals with storage guarantees on the scale of 100s to 1000s of years. Books like the CDR Primer do a great job of laying out the complexity of this landscape. Academic researchers and climate startups today are racing to explore these emerging technologies and pathways – each leveraging different mechanisms for CO2 sequestration, whether engineered or natural, biological or geochemical. Protocols, both as a market standardization mechanism or as a means for accelerating scientific understanding of specific CDR pathways, already seem to have a front seat at the show. During our hour together on Wednesday, we'll dig into the many different pathways being explored for durable CDR, unpack the current state of play, and look at a few specific points of leverage where protocol thinking can help the CDR industry reach the \"gigaton scale\" that many hope to see in the coming decades.\"",

      "content": "The single biggest question facing higher education in the AI era, when students everywhere are logging on to pro AI models for information on every subject on earth is, who sprinkles the magic dust that turns learning into a degree?I've written here, here, and here about how universities need to rethink everything, given what AI can do and what students are doing with AI. Tech leaders are advocating for skipping college altogether. Higher ed is offering college credit for just living life. Parents and lawmakers are right to scratch their heads.What exactly is the magic dust of a college degree in the GPT-5 era?For the record, I believe universities and faculty experts still have a tremendously important role to play. But we need to ask what \"learning\" is, what a \"degree\" is, and when the expensive, time-intensive \"learning theater\" we demand students participate in needs (finally) to end. We need much more attention to how exactly learning becomes a degree and who decides when and how to wave the magic wand and grant a diploma.I've argued that AI should deliver state-mandated general education. When learning outcomes are fixed and course content is fungible, this will free up hundreds of millions of dollars for human teaching at the edges of knowledge. Nobody has taken me up on it but not because anyone has argued that pro model AIs are not \"smart\" enough to teach gen ed.So let's turn the question around and ask what would happen if an AI tried to enroll in a university this fall, complete the work, and earn a degree? Consider this a diagnostic tool, like running a dye through the system to see where the actual substance flows versus where there's just empty pipework.I'll use Anthropic's Claude, only because he has a more human name than ChatGPT. Opus 4.1 just came out and it's quite good.Pretending to be humanThe challenge for an AI in attempting to enroll in a university is the need to pretend to be human, the very thing people fear. But let's say Claude created a persona with a plausible background, a high school transcript, test scores (his own), and personal essays (his own). For many public institutions (like the Cal State system), no essay is needed; a simple checklist of requirements met will do.At selective institutions, the primary challenge would be the admissions committee who assess character, life experience, and potential contributions to the campus community. Claude has no life experiences, family background, or personal challenges (that we know about). But still, if there's a human in the loop, it's always possible that someone will say \"okay,\" sprinkling the first magic dust on Claude as \"an enrolled student,\" with a student ID and a .edu email.Once admitted, a person would need to register Claude (who has no legal identity, SSN, or address) as a student. But let's say Claude passes this hurdle.Claude then signs up for general education classes, choosing asynchronous online classes. He logs in through the university's Learning Management Software (LMS) and absorbs readings, lectures, and research materials instantly. On schedule, he submits assignments and takes proctored exams. In online art and music classes Claude can submit artworks and compositions and comment on his peer work. He can \"discuss\" a text and \"comment\" on a class discussion board. For many courses, particularly in STEM, Claude will likely achieve perfect scores on exams.Let's say Claude did well enough for his professors to give him passing grades for the 28-40 credits of general education classes taken. Now comes the tricky part: choosing a major.At most universities, you need approval from a faculty member or professional advisor who will guide you, assessing progress and readiness for advanced work. Ideally, this relationship involves mentorship and a subjective judgment of intellectual maturity. There is often a final capstone project or thesis, which must be defended or approved by a committee of professors who evaluate originality and significance.Let's say Claude, via his .edu email, talks the advisor into a virtual relationship and is put on the approved list of majors. With some modifications to the assessment process (e.g., accepting simulated lab work or waiving participation), Claude could excel in computer science, math, statistics, data science, theoretical physics, computational linguistics. He'd best avoid fine arts (particularly dance), music performance, nursing, medicine, social work, lab-based science. He might be able to earn decent grades in history, anthropology, philosophy or literature, but let's say he majors in STEM.Finally, 2-3 years from now (let's say he's able to take 8 classes per semester, though he could easily take the whole 40, at 3 credits per course, in a year), he reaches the standard 120 credits needed to graduate. After the advisor checks to see that the required number of courses have been completed with a passing grade, a form is submitted, and the registrar double checks it against Claude's name on course list. Often the dean's office double checks the registrar and submits the final assessment that Claude completed their coursework for the chosen major.A long list of students is recommended for their degrees; the university's board of trustees then confers the list of degrees. Diplomas are printed and a seal is affixed. This is the final and most formal sprinkling of magic dust, where the institution, through its designated human authorities, officially vouches for the student as an educated person who has completed a journey of intellectual and personal growth.Has Claude \"learned\" anything?The Claude diagnostic shows that most of the current requirements (particularly gen ed courses delivered asynchronously online) are performing neither information transfer nor human development. Claude succeeds best at what universities do on the cheap: online courses requiring reading assigned works, discussing assigned topics, writing assigned papers, solving assigned problems, with the minimum of human oversight.Where Claude stumbles are moments where he needs to show human cognitive development. Just getting admitted to college is all about demonstrating potential, trajectory, growth, a future self; potential contribution to campus life, participation on athletic teams, clubs, tailgates. Claude is at a disadvantage.Faculty are encouraged to evaluate the human behind the work, not just the work, factoring in the trajectory of improvement, effort and struggle, classroom presence and engagement, that sense of whether a student is \"going through the motions\" or genuinely thinking. Great Books seminars and Socratic dialogues are on the rise. But even in lecture courses, many professors pride themselves in distinguishing authentic student work from something that \"simply repeats back information,\" even if the course is designed for the student to synthesize and repeat back information to receive a grade. The very thing that makes Claude useful becomes an obstacle to getting a degree.Claude can ace any online asynchronous course where there is minimum human interaction. This is the Claude test: if Claude can pass it easily, so can students, using Claude. Jettison Gen Ed Now (to save the magic dust)What the Claude diagnosis tells us is that universities should get out of the online asynchronous course business, and double down on mentorship, community, ethical development, and a trusted, human-centric environment for personal and intellectual transformation. This probably won't happen anytime soon because human teaching is expensive while online is profitable.So I am proposing something even more radical: unbundle general education from universities entirely. State legislatures: this is for you. Contract with AI firms to handle standardized content delivery for the general education content you're mandating. Do it at the high school level, better yet. Let universities focus exclusively on educating students directly, with mentorship and community. The \"magic dust\" of a college degree would then only sanctify genuine human transformation, not completed coursework.The ubiquity of online asynchronous courses demonstrates that universities haven't actually internalized their own rhetoric about human development. They're still operating on an industrial model of content delivery while claiming to be in the human transformation business. AI poses an existential threat to university's process more than its product.Parents balking at paying hundreds of thousands of dollars and tech CEOs saying skip college are both responding to the same confusion: universities can't articulate what they're actually selling. Is it information? AI has more. Is it credentials? Those are just database entries. Is it human development? Then why are most courses designed to avoid human interaction? The Claude diagnostic exposes this confusion. An entity with no capacity for human growth could earn a college degree signifying a) what it already knew and b) that it is good at pretending to be human. Until universities can explain why Claude should fail, they can't explain why humans should pay.Thanks for reading Anecdotal Value! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.",

This programmatic statement was included in the very first issue of the photography journal Sovetskoe Foto, published that same year. In fact, such amateur photographic practice—as Oksana Sarkisova and Olga Shevchenko make clear in their book In Visible Presence: Soviet Afterlives in Family Photos—was a key form of active Soviet citizenship. A photographer’s manual published in 1931 openly ordered all to turn their cameras away from family, friends, and other mundane subjects and demanded, “Not one photograph devoid of social significance!” As a scholar of photography, I appreciate anyone’s recognition of the power of photography. As a social scientist, I read the manual’s call to action as a statement of the obvious. Indeed, no photograph, Soviet or not—even (or perhaps, especially) that of friends, family, or other mundane subjects—is “devoid of social significance.” What people choose to photograph or put in family albums is itself socially significant.

Stay ahead of the curve! If you're not a premium subscriber, here's paid content from July you are missing out on.Understanding High-Voltage DC Power Architectures for AI MegafactoriesWhy Building Smarter EDA Tools Is Key To Winning The AI EraA Detailed Playbook to Leveling Up Your Meetings, Mentorship, and Career ConversationsIf you've done any hardware programming in engineering school or as a hobbyist, chances are you've used MATLAB. For a long time, it was the default tool for anyone learning technical computing. MATLAB was actually the first programming language I learned, close to two decades ago. But about ten years back, I moved entirely to Python. The company I was with didn't have sufficient MATLAB licenses or the toolboxes I needed, so I took it as a chance to pick up something new. I've been using Python ever since, and I'm guessing I'm not alone.Python, with its open ecosystem and vibrant online community really caught on in the early 2010s. Python's ecosystem—Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy—grew rapidly and gained traction among scientists and engineers. As these tools became more powerful and widely adopted, it became increasingly difficult to justify the license fees that MATLAB demands. Even with free MATLAB alternatives like GNU Octave, the growing ecosystem of packages in Python is still simply too hard to resist.For embedded programming and systems control, which are highly relevant to IoT, robotics, and real-time systems, the dominance of C/C++ is being challenged by Rust, a memory-safe alternative that uses a safety-first approach to programming instead of C/C++'s permissive-by-default approach. Today, the Linux kernel even supports experimental development in Rust. The 2024 Developer Survey by StackOverflow shows key insights when comparing MATLAB to Python, or C++ to Rust.Python is the most desired language (41.9% although it has its fair share of haters.)Rust is the most admired language (82.2%), and supersedes C/C++ in both admiration and desirability.MATLAB is the least admired language (21.2%, and even worse than Cobol at 26.2%).MathWorks also offers Simulink for system level simulations that is being challenged by alternatives such as:Modelica (or openModelica, the open-source version), which you can learn more about here. Pictorus, a browser first system simulation tool that uses Python and Rust under the hood. Pictorus is also free to use for individuals, and is a great alternative for scrappy teams to get their projects off the ground quickly.Scilab with XCOS, which is entirely free and open-source.Then, there are licensed alternatives like MapleSim (by Altair, acquired by Siemens), or SCADE (by Ansys, acquired by Synopsys).Should you learn MATLAB?Unless you're going to work in industries that are deeply entrenched in MATLAB already like aerospace and automotive, there is little incentive today to build your skills on MathWorks' platform products. Commercial licenses are expensive and every toolbox needs separate purchase. There are 'home' versions that are cheaper, but you still have to buy toolboxes separately for use.The syntax you learn is not transferrable to general purpose programming. If you encounter things that the MATLAB suite does not do as well, you'll be stuck.The closed ecosystem and corporate decisions on where innovations should go is inherently limiting. Open source alternatives like Python have ecosystems that develop much faster.In short, the answer is no. Chris Sullivan eloquently explains this in his blog post — What is happening to MATLAB?MathWorks is going to start showing the signs of collapse, either due to flight from expensive MATLAB to free Python, the lack of new grads interested in the language, or a transition away from C to Rust that they are not well-positioned to weather let alone lead.What should you learn instead?If the trends from the Stack Overflow survey are indicative of the state of programming today, your software skills for hardware engineering projects will be well served by learning Python and Rust.Python will cover all your needs for scripting, data analysis, machine learning, and hardware programming. There are plenty of open-source packages available, and maintained by top programmers in their respective domains. The syntax is easy to learn, and you'll be up and running in no time. Python does have its downsides when it comes to speed and dependency management, but it should suffice for most projects. If speed is your real concern, then you can look at Julia instead (it ranks pretty high on the admiration scale.)Rust is not easy to learn. The significant learning curve is offset by the speed and safety that the language offers. Given its high admiration as a programming language and steep learning curve, Rust expertise gives you a technical moat most cannot encroach. The official webpage has substantial learning resources if you're up for the challenge.Both Python and Rust are general purpose programming languages with their strengths and weaknesses. Learning them will ensure that your programming skills are transferrable across a wide range of industries and applications.While this suggestion may work as a prescribed starting point, I do realize that this by no means applies to all of hardware engineering. There are unique situations where certain programming languages are still perfect suited for what they do. If you think learning programming is no longer necessary due to AI, I'll just emphatically say that is never going to be the case in hardware engineering. Sure, AI will speed things up, but will never displace your foundational understanding.What other programming languages are relevant for hardware engineers today?What do you recommend and how difficult is it to learn?Let me know in the comments below.Share this post with at least 2 other people, and get one month of paid subscriber benefits on the house!Share",

      "content": "\"One of the most notable characteristics of any group developing towards domination is its struggle to assimilate and ideologically conquer traditional intellectuals — an assimilation and conquest which is all the more rapid and effective the more the given group simultaneously develops its own organic intellectuals.\" - Antonio Gramsci, \"The Intellectuals\"1With its rapid technological advancements and interconnectedness, the digital age has given rise to a new breed of influential thinkers. These people aren't traditional intellectuals as that term is usually understood — e.g. philosophers, artists, critics, scientists, novelists, architects, and so on — but rather represent an embedded class that can be best understood through the lens of early 20th century Italian Antonio Gramsci's concept of \"organic intellectuals.\" While Gramsci, writing from a fascist prison cell in the 1920s and 1930s, focused on the proletariat and its need for intellectuals emergent directly from that class to articulate their own worldview, his concept offers a useful way to understand the ideological vanguards that have been emerging from Silicon Valley since the beginning of this century. These individuals are not merely observers but active participants and builders of the technological and social paradigms they theorize about, laying the groundwork for a future social order that stands in stark contrast to the high modernist vision of \"Seeing Like a State.\"Gramsci's Organic Intellectuals in a Digital AgeFor Gramsci, traditional intellectuals saw themselves as autonomous, independent of any particular social class. In reality, he argued, they were often bound to the dominant class, helping to maintain its hegemony through the dissemination of its ideology. Organic intellectuals, by contrast, are born from and intimately connected to a specific social or professional class. They do not simply represent this class but are crucial in articulating its interests, developing its self-consciousness, and contructing the intellectual and ethical foundations for its rise to hegemony. They are the \"deputies\" of their class, organizing \"systems of relationships\" to advance its goals. Their function is not just to be eloquent or abstract thinkers but to actively participate in the practical life of their social class as \"constructors, organizers, and permanent persuaders.\"Translating this to Silicon Valley, the \"class\" in question isn't defined by traditional economic categories but by its shared ethos, its technical prowess, and its deep-seated belief in the transformative power of technology. The organic intellectuals of Silicon Valley are often founders, engineers, and investors who are deeply immersed in the creation and deployment of the technologies that are reshaping society. Their ideas are not abstract academic exercises but are directly informed by, and intended to influence, the practical realities of building software, hardware, and new networked systems. They are fluent in the language of code, venture capital, and disruption, and their intellectual output serves to legitimize, rationalize, and accelerate the particular social and economic models emerging from the tech world.These individuals are \"organic\" in Gramsci's sense because their intellectual work is directly linked to their professional and entrepreneurial activities. They don't just critique the status quo; they are building alternatives. Their intellectual labor is not separate from their economic pursuits; it is an intrinsic part of how they acquire wealth, influence, and cultural capital. They articulate the aspirations of a technocentric elite, providing a coherent narrative for their efforts to redefine governance, community, and even human nature itself. This alignment between thought and action is what makes them \"organic\" to the burgeoning digital civilization.The High Modernist State vs. Silicon Valley's FuturesTo understand the macro-vision articulated by these organic intellectuals, it's helpful to contrast it with the \"high modernist\" project critiqued by James C. Scott in his magisterial Seeing Like a State, which was published in 1998 just as Silicon Valley was beginning its ascent to a world-bestriding colossus. Scott's work details how 20th-century states, driven by a faith in scientific and technical progress, sought to impose simplified, legible, and standardized order on complex social and natural systems. This \"high modernism\" manifested in grand schemes of state-directed social engineering: collectivized agriculture, rational city planning (like Brasília), and the standardization of everything from surnames to property rights. The goal was to make society transparent and manageable from the top down, often at the expense of local knowledge, diversity, and human autonomy. Scott argued that this drive for legibility, coupled with authoritarian state power and a prostrate civil society, frequently led to disastrous outcomes, flattening rich, nuanced realities into simplistic, manipulable abstractions.The Silicon Valley organic intellectuals, while equally ambitious in their desire to reshape the human condition, and equally reductionist in their view of the human condition, offer visions that are fundamentally anti-high modernist in their structure, if not always in their potential for control. Instead of a centralized, top-down state imposing order, they propose distributed, networked, opt-in systems (assuming one can pay). Their blueprints for the future privilege individual agency (or at least, the agency of those who can navigate and afford these new systems), decentralization, cryptographic certainty, and fluid, voluntary associations over rigid, geographically bounded national structures. They see the state, as currently constituted, as an inefficient, often corrupt, and ultimately obsolete institution — just one more \"legacy system\" overdue for disruption and replacement.Meet Silicon Valley's Organic IntellectualsWho are these organic intellectuals? That's of course debatable, and many of my intellectual historian friends may be a bit horrified that I am dignifying this list of men with the moniker of intellectuals, but here's a reasonable sampling of some of the characteristic examples of what I am here describing as the Valley's organic intellectuals: Curtis Yarvin: Formerly operating under the pseudonym Mencius Moldbug, Curtis Yarvin is perhaps the most provocative and certainly the most controversial of this group. Yarvin's \"neoreactionary\" philosophy proposes a radical critique of liberal democracy, which he sees as inefficient and effectively governed by an unaccountable \"Cathedral\" (academia and mainstream media). His proposed alternative is a form of \"techno-monarchy\" or \"neocameralism,\" wherein the state would operate like a highly efficient corporation, run by a CEO-like sovereign with absolute authority. This vision is unabashedly anti-democratic and anti-egalitarian, advocating for a return to a more hierarchical, even \"neo-feudal,\" social order. While unapologetically authoritarian, Yarvin says he rejects democracy only because he believe that it is impossible to achieve \"clarity\" and efficiency in messy, consensus-driven systems. Like the high modernists, he wants legibility, but his preferred future is a stark departure from the high modernist state's attempts to manage a mass society through bureaucratic universalism; instead, he envisions a world managed with corporate precision by a clear, singular will, eschewing the democratic pretense. It's a vision of legibility through radical simplification and centralization, but one where the \"state\" is re-imagined as a lean, privately-owned enterprise rather than a public bureaucracy. Somewhat shockingly, the New York Times recently gave him a full-blown profile.Ben Goertzel: A leading figure in thinking about the deep long-term implications of potential artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel embodies the techno-optimist strand of Silicon Valley thought, but with a crucial decentralized twist. Goertzel is the founder and CEO of SingularityNET, a platform designed to create a decentralized, blockchain-based marketplace for AI services. Inspired by early 20th century Russian cosmism, his macro-vision is not about state control but about the emergence of a planetary-scale, collaborative AGI, leading humanity towards a \"post-human\" or \"Singularity\" future. Unlike the high modernist attempt to control human behavior through rigid systems, Goertzel envisions AGI (which he believes will arrive \"within three years\") as an accelerating force of intelligence and creativity that could solve humanity's grand challenges, from climate change to disease. His focus on decentralization through blockchain technology aims to prevent the monopolization of AI power by any single entity, be it a state or a corporation. He advocates for a future where intelligence is distributed and emergent, evolving through a complex network of autonomous AI agents rather than being centrally planned or dictated. This stands in direct opposition to the high modernist notion of a single, rational actor (the state) designing and controlling complex systems; instead, Goertzel champions a meta-system that self-organizes and self-improves.Stewart Brand: A polymath and foundational figure in Silicon Valley's self-mythologizing, Stewart Brand bridges the utopian aspirations of the 1960s with the pragmatic innovation of the Valley. Although he has never created a technology company himself, Brand embodies the \"serial entrepreneurship\" ethos of the Valley, having created the Whole Earth Catalog, co-founded the WELL (one of the earliest online communities) as well as the legendary futurist consultancy Global Business Network, and The Long Now Foundation. The enduring themes of Brand's evolving vision have been a deep concern for long-term thinking and the embrace of technology as a way to create new sociabilities. His \"Pace Layering\" theory, which describes how different rates of change in a civilization's systems (e.g., culture, governance, commerce, infrastructure) interact, speaks to a deeply organic and adaptive understanding of societal evolution. While the form of utopian dreaming has varied from one decade to the next, Brand's hoped for future has never been one that involved top-down planning but rather has always been about creating the conditions for a continuously evolving, resilient system.Balaji Srinivasan: A venture capitalist, entrepreneur, and prolific essayist, Balaji Srinivasan is a vocal proponent of a radical re-imagining of political organization: The Network State. Like Yarvin, Srinivasan argues that the nation-state is an outdated institution, too slow and inefficient to adapt to the rapid pace of technological change and global challenges. His vision involves highly aligned online communities, unified by shared moral and technical commitments, gradually crowdfunded in aterritorial configurations around the world, perhaps eventually gaining diplomatic recognition as sovereign entities. These \"startup societies\" would begin as digital communities, build trust offline, leverage cryptocurrencies for their economies, and ultimately manifest as physical \"archipelagos\" of land. Srinivasan's network state is the antithesis of the geographically fixed, centrally administered nation-state. It is fluid, voluntary, and digitally native. His emphasis on enabling Hirschmanian \"exit\" — the ability to opt out of existing failing systems and to join new ones — provides a counter-narrative to the high modernist state's assumption of fixed citizenship and territorial control. It is a quest for legibility and order, but one achieved through distributed consensus and cryptographic transparency rather than centralized command.Peter Thiel: A titan of venture capital and a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, Peter Thiel is arguably the most influential of the Valley's rightwing organic intellectuals. His intellectual contributions often revolve around a critique of what he perceives as societal stagnation and a defense of concentrated power as a means to achieve genuine innovation. In Zero to One, published in 2014 with the subtitle modestly promising to teach reader \"how to build the future,\" Thiel argues that true progress comes from creating monopolies (moving \"from zero to one\") rather than competing in existing markets (\"from one to N\"). Politically, Thiel is a staunch libertarian, advocating for minimal government intervention and maximal individual freedom, particularly for entrepreneurs and innovators. Like Srinivasan, he is deeply skeptical of democratic consensus and bureaucracy, seeing them as impediments to radical technological progress. His vision of the future is a world shaped by powerful, visionary technologists who, unburdened by democratic constraints, can build and scale transformative technologies. This aligns with Yarvin's critique of democratic inefficiency, but Thiel's solution is less about a centralized sovereign and more about empowering a technocratic elite to create the future. His backing of political candidates and his investments in technologies like Palantir (data analytics for government and security agencies) show a direct engagement with power, aiming to reshape it from within and without, aligning with his belief that politics can either accelerate or impede the future.Marc Andreessen: Co-creator of the Mosaic web browser and Netscape, and co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, a prominent venture capital firm, Marc Andreessen is a vocal proponent of \"techno-optimism\" and the inevitability that \"software will eat the world.\" His venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz (better known as \"a16z\"), is not just an investment vehicle but an ideological machine, publishing essays and podcasts that articulate a worldview centered on the necessity of building, innovation, and abundance. Andreessen's \"It's Time to Build\" manifesto (more accurately: rant), penned during the early days of the pandemic, urged a resurgence of productive capacity and a rejection of the spiritual and intellectual failure that he believes has led to a stagnant society. Like Thiel, he sees regulation, bureaucracy, and a general aversion to risk as hindering progress. His vision of the future is one where technology continuously expands human capabilities and material wealth, with less emphasis on traditional political structures and more on the dynamism of entrepreneurial innovation. He argues that the best form of governance is self-organizing markets and technological solutions that bypass the need for clumsy state intervention. He has no interest in designing a new state, but rather wants to build a world where the state becomes largely irrelevant in the face of exponential technological progress and entrepreneurial agency.Kevin Kelly: A founding editor of Wired magazine and a prolific author, Kevin Kelly offers a more optimistic and philosophical perspective on the technological future. His work, particularly Out of Control (1992) and What Technology Wants, explores the emergent properties of complex systems, the power of decentralized networks, and the quasi-biological evolution of technology. Kelly sees technology not just as tools, but as a \"seventh kingdom of life,\" an expanding \"Technium\" with its own drives and purposes. His vision is one of increasing interconnectedness, intelligence (distributed across networks), and continuous innovation, leading to what he calls \"protopia\" — a state of gradual, incremental improvement rather than a sudden utopia. Unlike the high modernists who sought to impose order, Kelly celebrates the inherent \"messiness\" and generative power of decentralized, self-organizing systems. An unapologetic techno-determinist, he envisions a future where collective intelligence, enabled by vast networks, leads to new forms of governance and problem-solving that emerge from the bottom up, rather than being dictated from the top down. His focus is less on explicit political structures and more on the underlying informational and network architectures that will inevitably shape human society.A Future Unseen by the StateWhat unites these disparate, sometimes conflicting, visions is a profound skepticism of the high modernist project and its instruments. They are, in their own ways, engaged in an effort to overcome the limitations of \"Seeing Like a State.\"Decentralization over Centralization: Whether it's Goertzel's decentralized AI, Brand's adaptive pace layers, Srinivasan's network states, or Kelly's emergent Technium, the emphasis is on distributed networks and local autonomy rather than centralized command and control. Even Yarvin's \"techno-monarchy,\" while seemingly centralizing, seeks to streamline and privatize governance away from the sprawling, often opaque, modern bureaucratic state. Thiel and Andreessen champion private enterprise and technological solutions over public sector intervention.Opt-in and Exit over Imposition: Srinivasan's network state explicitly champions the ability for individuals to choose their governance structures. This contrasts sharply with the high modernist state's tendency to impose universal standards and policies on its often-unwilling subjects. The emphasis is on voluntary association and market-driven solutions.Technological Solutions over Bureaucratic ones: All these intellectuals believe that advanced technology — AI, blockchain, network protocols, brain-computer interfaces, and so on — offers more robust and efficient solutions to societal problems than traditional political or bureaucratic means. They see technology not just as a tool, but as a medium for new forms of social organization, bypassing the need for state intervention.\"Metis\" and Emergent Order over Abstract Planning: While some of their visions involve grand designs, they often acknowledge, either explicitly (like Brand and Kelly) or implicitly (like Goertzel's emergent AGI), the importance of practical, situated knowledge and emergent order. This is a departure from what Scott characterized as the high modernist hubris of abstract, universal plans divorced from local realities.A New Legibility: While Scott argued that the state sought legibility to control, the Valley's organic intellectuals propose new forms of legibility based on data, networks, and cryptographic proofs. The \"network state\" aims for transparent and accountable governance through blockchain, and Goertzel's AGI would understand patterns on a global scale. This is a different kind of transparency — one that is supposed to empower participants and ensure integrity, rather than merely facilitating top-down control.The grand narratives spun by the Valley's organic intellectuals, while alluring in their vision of technologically-enabled liberation, also manifest an unsettling but highly telling lacuna: a near-total avoidance of the messy, irreducible problem of political power. With the notable exception of Curtis Yarvin, whose disturbing embrace of technocratic monarchy at least offers a candid, if chilling, locus of authority, many of these theories are studiously vague about where decision-making power truly resides in their idealized futures. They speak of decentralization, network effects, and voluntary associations, yet rarely grapple with how conflicts will be resolved, how minority rights will be protected, or how collective action will be steered without recourse to some form of accountable, legitimate authority. The unspoken assumption, often, is that software, algorithms, or emergent AI will somehow transcend the need for human political struggle and compromise, leading to an almost automatic, frictionless form of governance. They consistently sidestep fundamental questions of who decides, who benefits, and who is held responsible when things inevitably go awry — and in fact often get annoyed whenever anyone brings this question up to them (as I can testify from personal experience in dealing with several of these men).The closest glimpse the world has had into what the practical political manifestation of the Valley's organic political theory looks like was in the chaotic reign of Elon Musk's Twitter, rebranded as X, and his broader approach to governance during his tenure at \"DOGE\" (whose name was inspired by the decentralized spirit of Musk's DogeCoin). At both Twitter and DOGE, Musk's tenure has been characterized by a chainsaw approach to existing institutional capacity, whether it was the arbitrary dismantling of content moderation teams, the sudden revocation of established policies, or the general contempt for traditional regulatory frameworks. The implicit theory behind this destructive energy seems to be that by tearing down the \"legacy\" state apparatus — its rules, its experts, its bureaucratic safeguards — a vacuum will be created that will inevitably be backfilled by superior, AI-powered software solutions supplied by the very technologists advocating these visions.Unfortunately, the reality has been less a seamless transition to algorithmic utopia and more a descent into amplified misinformation, online harassment, and a palpable erosion of civic trust. The lessons from X suggest that simply digitizing existing societal problems, or removing human governance without a clear, accountable replacement, does not lead to a more enlightened future, but often to a more fragmented, less governable present. The hard questions of power, its exercise, and its accountability, remain stubbornly human, no matter how much code is thrown at them.1My own loose translation of: «Una delle caratteristiche più rilevanti di ogni gruppo che si sviluppa verso il dominio è la sua lotta per l'assimilazione e la conquista ideologica degli intellettuali tradizionali, assimilazione e conquista che è tanto più rapida ed efficace quanto più il gruppo dato elabora simultaneamente i propri intellettuali organici.»",

What's Alpha School's reflection?The rise of the secular homeschool superheroes.\"The Cheese that Gives you Nightmares.\"Avi Loeb at Harvard warns of alien invasion.Moths as celestial navigators.Will AI cause the next depression?From the archives.Comment, share anything, ask anything.1. GPT-5's debut is slop.GPT-5's launch is imminent. Likely tomorrow. We also have the first confirmed example of an output known for sure to be from GPT-5, which was shared by Sam Altman himself as a screenshot on social media. He asked GPT-5 \"what is the most thought-provoking show about AI?\"sourceHmmm. Hmmmmmmmmm.Yeah, so #2 is a slop answer, no? Maybe even arguably a hallucination. Certainly, that #2 recommendation, the TV show Devs, does initially seem like a good answer to Altman's question, in that it is \"prestige sci-fi\" and an overall high-quality show. But I've seen Devs. I'd recommend it myself, in fact (streaming on Hulu). Here's the thing: Devs is not a sci-fi show about AI! In no way, shape, or form, is it a show about AI. In fact, it's refreshing how not about AI it is. Instead, it's a show about quantum physics, free will, and determinism. This is the main techno-macguffin of Devs: a big honking quantum computer. spoilers for the first 30 minutes?As far as I can remember, the only brief mention of AI is how, in the first episode, the main protagonist of that episode is recruited away from an internal AI division of the company to go work on this new quantum computing project. Now, what's interesting is that GPT-5 does summarize the show appropriately as being about determinism and free will and existential tension (and, by implication, not about AI). But its correct summary makes its error of including Devs on the list almost worse, because it shows off the same inability to self-correct that LLMs have struggled with for years now. GPT-5 doesn't catch the logical inconsistency of giving a not-AI-based description of a TV show, despite being specifically asked for AI-based TV shows (there's not even a \"This isn't about AI, but it's a high-quality show about related subjects like...\"). Meaning that this output, the very first I've seen from GPT-5, feels extremely LLM-ish, falling into all the old traps. Its fundamental nature has not changed. This is why people still call it a \"stochastic parrot\" or \"autocomplete,\" and it's also why such criticisms, even though weaker in strength, can't be entirely dismissed. Even at GPT-5's incredible level of ability, its fundamental nature is still that of autocompleting conversations. In turn, autocompleting conversations leads to slop, exactly like giving Devs as a recommendation here. GPT-5 is secretly answering not Altman's question, but a different question entirely: when autocompleting a conversation about sci-fi shows and recommendations, what common answers crop up? Well, Devs often crops up, so let's list Devs here. Judge GPT-5's output by honest standards. If a human said to me \"There's this great sci-fi show about AI, you should check it out, it's called Devs,\" and then I went and watched Devs, I would spend the entire time waiting for the AI plot twist to make an appearance. At the series end, when the credits rolled, I would be 100% certain that person was an idiot.Subscribe now2. 10% of all summed human experience took place since the year 2000. According to a calculation by blogger Luke Eure, 50% of human experience (total experience hours by \"modern humans\") has taken place after 1300 AD.Which would mean that 10% of collective human experience has occurred since the year 2000! It also means that most of us now alive will live, or have lived, alongside a surprisingly large chunk of when things are happening (at least, from the intrinsic perspective).3. Education is a mirror. What's Alpha School's reflection?In the education space, the buzz right now is around Alpha School. Their pitch (covered widely in the media) is that they do 2 hours of learning a day with an \"AI tutor.\"Fox NewsMore recently, The New York Times profiled them:At Alpha's flagship, students spend a total of just two hours a day on subjects like reading and math, using A.I.-driven software. The remaining hours rely on A.I. and an adult \"guide,\" not a teacher, to help students develop practical skills in areas such as entrepreneurship, public speaking and financial literacy.I'll say upfront: I do believe that 2 hours of learning a day, if done well, could be enough for an education. I too think kids should have way more free time than they do. So there is something to the model of \"2 hours and done\" that I think is attractive. But I have some questions, as I was one of the few actual attendees to the first \"Alpha Anywhere\" live info session, which revealed details of how their new program for homeschoolers works. Having seen more of it, Alpha School appears based on progressing through pre-set educational apps, and doesn't primarily involve AI-as-tutor-qua-tutor often (i.e., interacting primarily with an AI like ChatGPT). While the Times says thatBut Alpha isn't using A.I. as a tutor or a supplement. It is the school's primary educational driver to move students through academic content.all I saw was one use case, which was AI basically making adaptive reading comprehension tests on the fly (I think that specifically is actually a bad idea, and it looked like reading boring LLM slop to me).For this reason, the more realistic story behind Alpha School is not \"Wow, this school is using AI to get such great results!\" but rather that Alpha School is \"education app stacking\" and there are finally good enough, and in-depth enough, educational apps to cover most of the high school curriculum in a high-quality and interactive way. That's a big and important change! E.g., consider this homeschooling mom, who points out that she was basically replicating what Alpha School is doing by using a similar set of education apps.Most importantly, and likely controversially, Alpha School pays the students to progress through the apps via an internal currency that can be redeemed for goodies (oddly, this detail is left out from the analysis of places like the Times—but hey, it's \"the paper of record,\" right?).My thoughts are two-fold. First, I do think it's true that ed-apps have gotten good enough to replace a lot of the core curriculum and allow for remarkable acceleration. Second, I think it's a mistake to separate the guides from the learning itself. That is, it appears the actual academics at Alpha School are self-contained, as if in a box; there's a firewall between the intellectual environment of the school and what's actually being learned during those 2 hours on the apps. Not to say that's bad for all kids! Plenty of kids ultimately are interested in things beyond academics, and sequestering the academics \"in a box\" isn't necessarily bad for them.However, it's inevitable that this disconnect makes the academics fundamentally perfunctory (to be fair, this is true for a lot of traditional schools as well). As I once wrote about the importance of human tutors:Serious learning is socio-intellectual. Even if the intellectual part were to ever get fully covered by AI one day, the \"socio\" part cannot... just like how great companies often have an irreducibly great culture, so does intellectual progress, education, and advancement have an irreducible social component.Now, I'm sure that Alpha School has a socio-intellectual culture! It's just that the culture doesn't appear to be about the actual academics learned during those 2 hours. And that matters for what the kids work on and find interesting themselves. E.g., in the Times we get an example of student projects like \"a chatbot that offers dating advice,\" and in Fox News another example was an \"AI dating coach for teenagers,\" and one of the cited recent accolades of Alpha School students is placing 2nd in some new high school competition, the Global AI Debates.At least in terms of the public examples, a lot of the most impressive academic/intellectual successes of the kids at Alpha School appear to involve AI. Why? Because the people running Alpha School are most interested in AI!And now apply that to everything: that's true for math, and literature, and science, and philosophy. So then you can see the problem: the disconnect between the role models and the academics. If the Alpha School guides and staff don't really care about math—if it's just a hurdle to be overcome, just another hoop to jump through—why should the kids?Want to know why education is hard? Harder than almost anything in the world? It's not that education doesn't work. Rather, the problem is that it works too well.Education is a mirror. Read more",

      "content": "That the Holocaust—the systematic mass murder of ~5-6 million Jews—occurred is beyond doubt. If you're curious about the evidence for this, I recommend Michael Shermer's book, ' opening statement in his debate, and this essay by Eric Hunt, a former Holocaust denier who went so far as to kidnap Elie Wiesel, wherein he explains why he stopped denying the Holocaust. The blog Holocaust Controversies is a particularly good source for debunking random claims made by holocaust deniers, because the author is both overwhelmingly knowledgeable and has seemingly infinite patience to track down and rebut claims made by leading revisionists. The evidence is quite overwhelming, so much so that the Nazis hanged at Nuremberg never denied that the Holocaust had taken place. One would expect that if large numbers of people were tried for a crime that hadn't taken place, at least one of them would have denied the existence of the crime, rather than merely claimed to have been following the orders of others. We have eyewitness testimony from victims, Nazi collaborators, diary entries, and many items of physical evidence, often converging to tell identical stories. Perhaps the most decisive evidence is the missing people—millions of Jews who vanished off the face of the Earth, often after being sent to concentration camps. Where, pray tell, did they go? Generally, the revisionist explanation is that they were relocated somewhere else, despite there being no evidence of any relocation, no Nazi records describing relocation (despite meticulous Nazi record-keeping), and no plausible place they were relocated. Were they relocated to Eastern Europe—then why were Jewish populations in Eastern Europe almost entirely eradicated? Were they sent to the Soviet Union—why on God's green earth would the Soviets continually take in German shipments of Jews midway through an active war? And why is there no record of this? To think this, you have to think the Nazis carted ~5 million people around the world without leaving even a shred of documentation. Back in the day, the influential Holocaust deniers were people like Robert Faurisson and David Irving—men who spoke eloquently and wrote detailed footnote-filled documents, thus maintaining a thin veil of respectability. They wrote books, they went to work in suits, and sometimes were publishing historians, though, of course, on the Holocaust issue, they were completely and totally outside of the mainstream consensus. Because these people were cranks with a clear agenda, they never moved the needle on the Holocaust question. Unfortunately, with the dawn of the internet, this has been replaced by an, if possible, even less reputable brand of Holocaust denialism. Internet holocaust denial increasingly claims to just be kidding and asking questions—it flirts with Holocaust denial without ever really stating it. It is part of the based ritual; in certain right-wing spaces, it has become fashionable to joke about the Holocaust and downplay it. It's unclear how seriously such people are in their denial—for most of them it's just a joke or a meme. They uncritically repeat denialist talking points not because they've thought hard about them, but because they know that Holocaust denial is just about the most reviled view in modern society. You can get a bit of a rise out of liberals by making racist jokes, but vastly more rise by denying the Holocaust. Because much of the modern right has devolved to childish contrarianism—a desire to shock, rather than find the truth—denialism has taken off. Nick Fuentes, a man who met with Trump, has repeatedly questioned Holocaust numbers. In one particularly amusing instance, Fuentes approvingly read out a chat question asking \"If I take 1 hour to cook a batch of cookies and the cookie monster has 15 ovens working 24 hours a day how long does it take cookie monster to make 6 million cookies?\" However, in fact, if the batches are twelve cookies, it would take just over four years! So even by Fuentes's idiotic analogy—neglecting, for example, the number of Jews shot during the Holocaust and killed in other ways—the math still checks out! What a dunce! A substacker called RFH (short for Rad-Fem Hitler), with tens of thousands of Twitter followers recently expressed support for a kind of Holocaust revisionism that is perhaps even dumber! (The 5-6 million number comes from corroborating estimates of the number dead at each camp with the number of missing Jews). This RFH comment is particularly demonstrative of the new breed of Holocaust revisionism in its sheer apathy and stupidity. She is not saying that she has investigated the numbers and concluded they're wrong. Instead, she just sort of guessed the number and didn't bother checking. The new breed of Holocaust revisionists are, more than anything else, monumentally lazy and apathetic. Daryl Cooper, the man with the largest history substack, who Tucker praised as the most serious living historian, has similarly expressed support for Holocaust revisionism (Edit 8/6: Cooper it looks like was talking about something different, see Mark's comment. Though Cooper has described himself as a big fan of David Irving chiefly known for holocaust revisionism, and he called Churchill the chief villain of world war two, so it still seems decently likely that he's some sort of revisionist). Cooper has claimed that the Holocaust wasn't a deliberate plan for extermination, but that Germans simply ran out of food and large numbers of Jews starved. This contradicts explicit statements from Nazi officials demonstrating the pre-planned nature of the Holocaust. For example, in Goebbels' diary, he wrote: Beginning with Lublin, the Jews in the General Government are now being evacuated eastward. The procedure is a pretty barbaric one and not to be described here more definitely. Not much will remain of the Jews. On the whole it can be said that about 60 per cent of them will have to be liquidated whereas only about 40 per cent can be used for forced labor.And in speeches, Goebbels said:On the Jewish question, the Führer has decided to make a clean sweep. He prophesied to the Jews that, if they yet again brought about a world war, they would experience their own annihilation. That was not just a figure of speech. The world war is here, the destruction of the Jews must be the necessary consequence.Hmm...I wonder what he was talking about. Similar admissions come from Eichmann, Frank, Jager, Hoss, and various others. Jager admitted, for instance: I confirm today that Einsatzkommando 3 has achieved the goal of solving the Jewish problem in Lithuania: There are no more Jewish in Lithuania, apart from working Jews and their families. I wanted to eliminate the working Jews and their families as well, but the Civil Administration and the Wehrmacht attacked me most sharply and issued a prohibition against having these Jews and their families shot.And Höss went so far as to say: I commanded Auschwitz until 1 December 1943, and estimate that at least2,500,000 victims were executed and exterminated there by gassing and burning, and at least another half million succumbed to starvation and disease making a total dead of about 3,000,000.(Note: Höss's estimate far surpassed the real number of deaths which was nearer to 1.1 million). But Cooper represents, in some sense, a dramatic departure from the new norm, a return to the old Holocaust revisionists who pretended to be serious historians. Most of the new breed are more like Fuentes, claiming that they're just joking on the internet, just asking questions. About 20% of young Americans deny the Holocaust. Edit: thanks for Dan Williams for pointing out that this is nonsense! Sorry to have fallen for it. The link also gives some reason to be skeptical of the other poll results. 46% of young people in France hadn't heard of the Holocaust. 28% of Adults in Romania believe 2 million or fewer Jews were killed in the Holocaust. This is alarming. Remaining ignorant of history is bad in its own right, but remaining ignorant of the history of how a developed nation became engaged in targeted mass-murder is particularly dangerous. Those who dwell in developed nations ought to learn a thing or two about how developed nations carry out hideous crimes.Of the dispiritingly sizeable chunk of the public who denies the Holocaust, most aren't sophisticated revisionists. Most wouldn't be able to describe in detail why they reject the arguments for the Holocaust. Rather than having fringe and kooky explanations of the data—whereby, for instance, they creatively reinterpret all the above statements—they're just ignorant of the data. They just don't know about the evidence for the Holocaust. For the modern right, the kinds of people who follow Nick Fuentes, Candace Owens, and Andrew Tate, Holocaust denial is no longer a historical question to seriously evaluate, but a possible avenue for one to vice signal and demonstrate how little deference they give to the liberal establishment. Anti-semitism is increasingly becoming mainstream on the American right. The DHS Twitter account recently Tweeted out a flagrant Nazi dog-whistle. Podcasts get millions of views peddling some combination of Holocaust denialism and—even worse—apologia, where people argue that though the Holocaust did occur, it was justified due to the threat from European Jews (occasionally one even gets the rather confusing combination of people who are skeptical that the Holocaust happened, but think it would have been alright if it had). Some of the most influential conservative commentators like Candace Owen are open anti-semites who peddle nonsense conspiracy theories about Jews. This is an alarming trend. Anti-semitism is one of humankind's most ancient evils, and though there was a long period during which it was in decline, it may be making a comeback. We should be alarmed at the spread of a murderous ideology that almost entirely annihilated European Jewry. Millions of Jews were systematically murdered across Europe. We owe it to the victims of this unspeakable crime not to lie about them, treat them as a convenient political football, or use them as tools to vice signal our disregard for liberal norms. Millions of Jews across Europe are now ash because of the work of the Nazis, and those who downplay or defend their actions are complicit in a grotesque whitewashing of mass slaughter.",

      "content": "Illustration by Alexander NaughtonIf you seek advice from people at the very top of competitive domains, you'll probably hear a lot about the power of tenacity, grit, and determination. There is obviously wisdom in this: You won't get very far in life if you're constantly changing course at the first sign of challenge or boredom. And it's probably true that you will never be one of the very best in the world at something without developing a singleminded and lifelong obsession with it.But most of us don't have a shot at being on one of those podiums, or even aspire to it. For us, there's little danger in prematurely abandoning our latent potential to be the best gamer, or the best free diver, or the best developer. The far, far greater danger is in devoting our days to something that fundamentally doesn't matter to us, because we're too afraid to cut our losses.For creatures such as ourselves, more should be said in praise of quitting.As Kenny Rogers said, \"you've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away,\" and wouldn't you know it, I have a poker analogy for this.Poker comes in two basic formats: cash games, where you can buy as many chips as you want whenever you want, and tournaments, where you get one stack of chips to start with and you play until you run out of them. With cash games, you can take your money and leave at any point. In tournaments, all of the prize money is allocated according to a payout structure, with the people who last the longest earning the most.Tournament poker is basically about finding the highest-value uses of a scarce resource, your chips. The fact that losing those chips means getting completely locked out of a shot to win major money means that their opportunity cost is high. This means it can be a big mistake to commit yourself to hands that are somewhat positive-value in expectation, if you have good reason to believe there will be better, higher-value opportunities.Life is, of course, just like this: You get only one shot, and it's up to you to make the most of it by rejecting okay or even pretty good ways to allocate your time or other resources — to hunt down the opportunities to make really great bets on yourself. Do not make barely positive-value bets with your life!Thanks for reading Useful Fictions! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my dopamine habit.I think quitting is one of my primary superpowers. Success in multiple fields is only possible if you're willing to quit multiple fields.In 2023, my cofounders and I at Alvea decided to wind down the company when it became clear that our original direction wasn't going to pan out, and that our alternative line of business was not going to have the impact on the world that our employees or investors had shown up for. Some years before that, I quit corporate law shortly before I would have made partner, because I knew that once I did the money would be too hard to walk away from.At both points, I realized I was a ways down the road toward a destination I no longer wanted to get to, and rather than keep driving, I took an exit. This was indispensable in getting me to a place where I actually wanted to be.It can be hard to quit sometimes because it feels like an admission that you made a mistake, that you took the wrong path in getting there. But this isn't necessarily true.The interesting thing about steady jobs is that they're actually not so steady. They are static in a conceptual sense — in the sense that if you say you're a \"lawyer\" when you're 30, and say you're a \"lawyer\" when you're 50, there is the same label for what you do. And that can feel like steadiness, like a reassuring kind of coherence to your life story.But the truth is that everything is in constant flux. Beneath the labels, life continues evolving all the time. Your interests change, companies change, and industries change. Given that your \"steady job\" is constantly evolving, even if you picked the highest-leverage option initially, there is a low chance that it will remain your highest-leverage option over time.The same goes for places to live, relationships, opinions, and hobbies. Over time, these things can degrade in value or resonance — and yet still retain the emotional pull of their initial promise. And when this happens, people often stay too long.One of the factors that underlies this is loss aversion, the psychological phenomenon by which losing $100 feels about twice as bad as gaining $100 does good. This asymmetry has deep consequences. In real life, it manifests as a reluctance to abandon sunk costs — we keep investing in doomed projects, relationships, or careers because leaving feels like locking in a loss, rather than setting ourselves up for a future potential gain. Retail traders double down on losing stocks rather than closing out their positions. Founders keep going with failing companies even when there's a good opportunity to bail out.As a result, quitting often feels emotionally wrong even when it is logically right. So if you want to be smart about it, you'll have to learn how to see through the illusory weight of loss.How do you do that?It's not an easy task, because research suggests that merely being aware of loss aversion doesn't significantly reduce its influence on behavior. So you can expect strategic quitting to be difficult. However, making yourself painfully aware of your choices is often the first step in changing them.By default, we tend to think of \"choices\" as the kinds of things that take us off the path we're already on. From this stance, it doesn't feel like we are \"choosing\" to go to our job every day, or choosing to remain where we live. The scary thing is that this means we can actually be making the biggest mistake of our lives on a daily basis, despite it feeling like nothing is happening at all. If we want to evaluate whether our current set of choices is really best or whether it's just inertia keeping us where we are, it can be powerful to upend that frame.Try it. Go around your day, narrating all of your choices to yourself. With everything you do, consciously say, in your head: \"I am choosing to do this, because it's the best course of action according to all the information I have available.\" See if it feels true. It might — perhaps this exercise will reinforce your conviction. But you might also find that entire regions of your life suddenly look strange. The declaration that you're doing the best thing will sound like hollow propaganda, an attempt to convince yourself of something you know just isn't so.Another powerful exercise, of a similar kind: Imagine that you were instantly unsubscribed from everything in your life. All of your choices undone — where you live, who you're with, what you do with your time. All of a sudden, you're a completely empty canvas. And then, imagine that you have the power to bring back each element just by hitting a \"resubscribe\" button, like it's an email newsletter. Being honest with yourself, which elements would you hit \"resubscribe\" on? What percentage of your current activities are an unambiguous \"yes?\" What percentage would you unceremoniously drop, if you were given the opportunity?Once you realize you're choosing something, you regain the ability to un-choose it. Note that un-choosing doesn't always mean quitting in the complete, traditional sense. It might just mean an alteration — working hard to establish a new phase in your relationship, or changing roles at your job, or moving to a different neighborhood rather than a different country. This, too, is strategic quitting: declaring that a given battle is over so that you can win the war.Leaving can still break your heart even though it's the right thing to do.We human beings are adaptive creatures. We have the ability to develop fondness for our current situation, even when we don't like it overall. When I was a young lawyer, it took me a couple of years to notice that I really didn't like living in New York — it was too big and loud and indifferent for me to ever feel at home there. But I still found lots of pieces of it to love, and believed that it would feel like something important had been sacrificed once I moved away. In the lead-up to the move, I found myself romanticizing aspects of the city that I'd never really paid attention to before, because I suddenly saw them as pleasures I was about to lose access to.But something to remember is that there is always some unknown part of the future that you will be equally fond of. Before moving to Washington DC, I couldn't have imagined all of the attachments I'd have to it. And after every other transition in my life, there were likewise things to love that I couldn't have previously pictured.When people think about quitting, it's hard because they're comparing the rich web of attachments they have now to some mostly blank slate, or, worse, the possibility of disaster. However, what's more realistic to imagine, if you're leaving something you're no longer aligned with, is a future with more to love than you have now. Those things you will be attached to in the future are currently obscured by the impassable barrier of time, but they're still out there.Sign up to be notified when my book, You Can Just Do Things, is available for purchase.Thanks for reading Useful Fictions!

(permalink) I don't think AI can do your job (but I do think an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job). However, there is a class of workers whose jobs can be performed perfectly by AI: workers with bullshit jobs: https://memex.craphound.com/2018/06/20/david-graebers-bullshit-jobs-why-does-the-economy-sustain-jobs-that-no-one-values/ David Graeber (RIP) identified several kinds of bullshit jobs and not all of those can be perfectly performed by an AI (for example, the flunkies that minor corporate princelings surround themselves with to demonstrate their status need to be human). But there are whole categories of job that perform functions that corporations don't want performed, like customer service rep, jobs they've spent decades degrading to the point where the people who do them have been stripped of all power and authority and serve no function except allowing a company to claim that they have a customer service department. Replacing these workers with an AI not only saves money by removing their wage-bill from the corporate overhead, but it can actually turn the former cost center into a profit center. That's what Air Canada discovered when they replaced their customer service workers with chatbots. These chatbots gave bad advice to fliers that cost them money, and in every instance except one (where the aggrieved flier was so tenacious that he chased 8 weeks' worth of internal appeals at Air Canada before escalating the matter to a regulator), Air Canada got to keep the money: https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisagarcia/2024/02/19/what-air-canada-lost-in-remarkable-lying-ai-chatbot-case/ All of this raises an obvious question: how can Air Canada (and other companies) get away with having customer service reps who are so useless that they can be swapped for defective chatbots? The answer lies in enshittification. While most people who encounter the idea of enshittification glom onto the symptoms it describes, of a three-stage process by which platforms shuttle value from users to business customers to themselves, the crux of enshittification is why this decay takes place. The answer is power: firms that enshittify must first overpower the forces that keep their enshittificatory impulses in check, like competition and regulation (these are two sides of the same coin: getting rid of competition paves the way for regulatory capture). Over decades, Air Canada has merged with the majority of its competitors and has become so structurally important to Canada – a big, geographically dispersed country with many fly-in settlements – that regulators can't really threaten it with meaningful penalties, not without threatening Canada itself. They're too big to fail, thus too big too jail, thus too big to care. That's how Air Canada was able to turn its customer service department into such a joke that it just didn't matter anymore, and so it didn't matter if it replaced those purely ornamental customer service reps with chatbots. The rise and rise of overseas call-center outsourcing paved the way for AI replacement in the same way that Walmart paved the way for Amazon. Once Walmart destroyed your town center and vaporized all the businesses that served your community, why wouldn't you shop on Amazon? Likewise: once companies replaced their customer service department with immiserated overseas call-center workers who were required to recite rote responses from a three-ring binder and were given no agency or capacity to solve your problem, why not replace them with AIs? Monopolistic firms are full of people who they don't value because they do jobs the company doesn't value (e.g. moderators on large social media services). This week, I'm at Skyboat Media studios, recording the audiobook for the Enshittification book, and so I got to talking with Gabrielle De Cuir and Stefan Rudnicki, the owners. They talked about the threat they're facing from AI audiobook \"narrators,\" who replace directors, actors and editors with a single piece of software. There's a whole class of audiobooks where AI can be a perfect substitute – thanks to Audible, and its enshittification. Audible has waged war on unionized voice actors, replacing them with desperate newbies who will tolerate terrible working conditions, including a practice called \"punch and roll\" that makes actors responsible for doing their own editing when they misspeak, rather than re-recording a passage for an editor to fix later (\"pickups\"). There are plenty of Audible books that are recorded without a director or an editor or a proofer, meaning that inexperienced actor's mistakes and mispronunciations survive into the final product. These books, produced by the monopolist audiobook platform, with a 90%+ market share for popular fiction, are already degraded to the point of being not fit for purpose. Replacing the actors with AI barely makes a difference. AI text-to-speech is a giant improvement on existing TTS tools, and there are plenty of people who stand to benefit from this, for example, people with visual impairments. But there's no business model in selling readaloud bots to blind people – certainly not a model that recoups the hundreds of billions that has been sprayed around for AI training and operation. The AI business model relies on obliterating the wage bill of workers and replacing it with a cheaper software license. Unfortunately (for the fortunes of AI investors) the majority of workers whose wages can be readily swapped for a software license are the lowest-paid, most precarious ones, people whose jobs have already been degraded and enshittified to the point where no one will notice the difference if they are replaced with a chatbot.

      "content": "After the US election last November, I changed my plans.For many years, I had been writing about America, Europe, Russia and Ukraine, describing and analyzing the breakdown of international norms, the spread of authoritarian propaganda, deliberate attempts to create refugees and violence. I knew that Trump's victory ensured that these geopolitical shifts, away from the rule of law and towards a more anarchic world, would become permanent. Of course I would continue about what that means for Americans, for Europeans, for Ukrainians. But I also wanted to look at the problem differently. How does this shift look from elsewhere? What does the post-American world look like from Sudan, for example, where a civil war has displaced more people than in Ukraine and Gaza combined?I made two trips to the region, to both sides of the main frontline. The first time I crossed the border into Sudan from Chad, escorted by the Rapid Support Forces, the militia group who occupy Darfur. The second time I flew via Dubai into Port Sudan, on the coast, and then drove to Khartoum—it's about a twelve-hour drive across the desert—with an official from the Sudanese armed forces and the photographer Lynsey Addario. On both trips, I saw what happens when the state disappears. Sudan is now in its third year of a civil war that seems to have no point, no purpose, and no end. Like a tsunami or a hurricane, the war has left wide swathes of physical wreckage in its wake, and human damage too. Food is scarce. The education system has collapsed. International institutions are weak. And, as it turns out, when you take away the liberal world order, you don't get something better. Instead, you get anarchy, nihilism, and a war fueled by outsiders - Saudi, Emirati, Turkish, Egyptian, Russian, Iranian – and a scramble for Sudanese gold.The first section of the article follows, but please read the whole thing: it takes time and space to tell the full story, to explain the history and background, and the article is designed for people who don't necessarily know much about Sudan at all. Of course I am not just writing about geopolitics: Sudan has a specific history that matters. Also, if you read the full story, either on the website or in the physical magazine, you can see all of Lynsey's amazing photographs. While you are at it, subscribe to the Atlantic. Without their support, I couldn't have made these trips. My editors supplied not just airplane tickets but security advice, GPS trackers, even energy bars. Not all journalism can be written from your home office, or any office. Also, I have lots of great colleagues, and you can read them too. The full article about SudanSubscribe to the AtlanticThis is What the End of the Liberal World Order Looks Like In the weeks before they surrendered control of Khartoum, the Rapid Support Forces sometimes took revenge on civilians. If their soldiers lost territory to the Sudanese Armed Forces during the day, the militia's commanders would turn their artillery on residential neighborhoods at night. On several consecutive evenings in March, we heard these attacks from Omdurman, on the other side of the Nile from the Sudanese capital.From an apartment that would in better times have been home to a middle class Sudanese family, we would hear one explosion. Then two more. Sometimes a response, shells or gunfire from the other side. Each loud noise meant that a child had been wounded, a grandmother killed, a house destroyed.Just a few steps away from us, grocery stores, busy in the evening because of Ramadan, were selling powdered milk, imported chocolate, bags of rice. Street ven dors were frying falafel in large iron skillets, then scooping the balls into paper cones. One night someone brought out folding chairs for a street concert, and music flowed through crackly speakers. The shell ing began again a few hours later, probably hitting similar streets and similar grocery stores, similar falafel stands and similar street musicians a couple dozen miles away. This wasn't merely the sound of artillery, but the sound of nihilism and anarchy, of lives disrupted, businesses ruined, universi ties closed, futures curtailed.In the mornings, we drove down streets on the outskirts of Khartoum that had recently been battlegrounds, swerving to avoid remnants of furniture, chunks of concrete, potholes, bits of metal. As they retreated from Khartoum, the Rapid Support Forces—the paramilitary organization whose power struggle with the Sudanese Armed Forces has, since 2023, blossomed into a full-fledged civil war—had systematically looted apartments, offices, and shops. Sometimes we came across clusters of washing machines and furniture that the thieves had not had time to take with them. One day we followed a car carrying men from the Sudanese Red Crescent, dressed in white hazmat suits. We got out to watch, handkerchiefs covering our faces to block the smell, as the team pulled corpses from a well. Neighbors clustered alongside us, murmuring that they had suspected bod ies might be down there. They had heard screams at night, during the two years of occupation by the RSF, and guessed what was happening.Another day we went to a cross ing point, where people escaping RSF occupied areas were arriving in Sudanese army-controlled areas. Riding on donkeycarts piled high with furniture, clothes, and kitchen pans, they described a journey through a lawless inferno. Many had been deprived of food along the way, or robbed, or worse. In a house near the front line, one woman told me that she and her teenage daughter had both been stopped by an RSF convoy and raped. We were sitting in an empty room, devoid of decoration. The girl covered her face while her mother was talking, and did not speak at all.At al-Nau Hospital, the largest still operating in the Khartoum region, we met some of the victims of the shelling, among them a small boy and a baby girl, Bashir and Mihad, a brother and sister dressed in blue and pink. The terror and screaming of the night before had subsided, and they were simply lying together, wrapped in bandages, on a cot in a crowded room. I spoke with their father, Ahmed Ali. The recording of our conversation is hard to understand because several people were gathered around us, because others were talking loudly nearby, and because Mihad had begun to cry. Ali told me that he and his family had been trying to escape an area controlled by the RSF but had been caught in shelling at 2 a.m., the same explosions we had heard from our apartment in Omdur man. The children had been wounded by shrapnel. He had nowhere else to take them except this noisy ward, and no plans except to remain at the hospital and wait to see what would happen next.Like a tsunami, the war has created wide swaths of physical wreckage. Farther out of town, at the Al-Jaili oil refinery, formerly the largest and most modern in the country—the focus of major Chinese investment—fires had burned so fiercely and for so long that giant pipelines and towering storage tanks, blackened by the inferno, lay mangled and twisted on the ground. At the studios of the Sudanese national broadcaster, the burned skeleton of what had been a television van, its satel lite dish still on top, stood in a garage near an accounting office that had been used as a prison. Graffiti was scrawled on the wall of the office, the lyrics to a song; clothes, office supplies, and rubble lay strewn across the floor. We walked through radio studios, dusty and abandoned, the presenters' chairs covered in debris. In the television studios, recently refurbished with American assistance, old tapes belonging to the Sudanese national video archive had been used to build barricades.Statistics are sometimes used to express the scale of the destruction in Sudan. About 14 million people have been displaced by years of fighting, more than in Ukraine and Gaza combined. Some 4 mil lion of them have fled across borders, many to arid, impoverished places—Chad, Ethiopia, South Sudan—where there are few resources to support them. At least 150,000 people have died in the conflict, but that's likely a significant undercounting. Half the population, nearly 25 million people, is expected to go hungry this year. Hundreds of thousands of people are directly threat ened with starvation. More than 17 million children, out of 19 million, are not in school. A cholera epidemic rages. Malaria is endemic.But no statistics can express the sense of pointlessness, of meaninglessness, that the war has left behind alongside the physical destruction. I felt this most strongly in the al-Ahamdda displaced-persons camp just outside Khartoum—although the word camp is misleading, giving a false impres sion of something organized, with a field kitchen and proper tents. None of those things was available at what was in fact a former school. Some 2,000 people were sleeping on the ground beneath makeshift shelters, or inside plain concrete rooms, using whatever blankets they had brought from wherever they used to call home. A young woman in a black headscarf told me she had just sat for her university exams when the civil war began but had already \"forgot about education.\" An older woman with a baby told me her husband had dis appeared three or four months earlier, but she didn't know where or why. No international charities or agencies were anywhere in evidence. Only a few local volunteers from the Emergency Response Rooms, Sudan's mutual-aid movement, were there to organize a daily meal for people who seemed to have washed up by accident and found they couldn't leave.As we were speaking with the volunteers, several boys ostentatiously carrying rifles stood guard a short distance away. One younger boy, dressed in a camouflage T-shirt and sandals—he told me he was 14 but seemed closer to 10—hung around watching the older boys. When one of them gave him a rifle to carry, just for a few minutes, he stood up straighter and solemnly posed for a photograph. He had surely seen people with guns, understood that those people had power, and wanted to be one of them.What was the alternative? There was no school at the camp, and no work. There was nothing to do in the 100-degree heat except wait. The artillery fire, the burned television station, the melted refinery, the rapes and the murders, the children in the hospital—all of that had led to noth ing, built nothing, only this vacuum. Nointernational laws, no international organizations, no diplomats, and certainly no Americans are coming to fill it.The end of the liberal world order is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot in conference rooms and university lecture halls in places like Washington and Brussels. But in al-Ahamdda, this theoretical idea has become reality. The liberal world order has already ended in Sudan, and there isn't anything to replace it. These are my photographs from the al-Ahamdda camp Subscribe to the AtlanticThe Emergency Response Rooms In the last part of the article, I write about the civilian volunteers who have spent the past three years helping people survive, building a movement known as the Emergency Response Rooms. The volunteers talk about democracy and human rights, not because they have been influenced by outsiders but because they have seen what the world looks like without these things. As one of them told me: in the midst of destruction, the only possible response is to build:Asked about motivations, one used the term nafeer, which refers to \"communal labor\" or \"communal work.\" Another mentioned takiya, when \"people collect their food together and to eat together, to share it, if somebody doesn't have food for sup- per or dinner.\" While traveling in Sudan during Ramadan, I saw many instances of men far from home—drivers, workers, or indeed our translators—joining the communal prayers and meals served on the street when the fast is broken at sundown.It's easy, from a great distance, to be cynical about or dismissive of the prospects for good government in Sudan, but these are the same kinds of traditions that have become the foundation for more democratic, less violent political systems in other places. Nafeer reminded me of toloka, an old Slavic word I heard used to explain the roots of the volunteer movement in Ukraine. Takiya sounds like the community barn raisings of 19th-century rural America. The communal activists who draw on these old ideas do so not because of a foreign influence campaign, or because they have read John Locke or James Madison...They do so because their experience with autocracy, violence, and nihilism pushes them to want democracy, civilian government, and a system of power-sharing that would include all the people and all the tribes of Sudan.These are people waiting in line for bean soup at one of the ERRs (my photographs). It costs a few cents a day to feed people in this manner. But some of the kitchens have had to serve fewer people, or on fewer days, because of USAID cuts.

But oftentimes, it is their lesser known writing which best represents their literary output.When you explore an author's lesser known catalog, you get the opportunity to engage with aspects of their thought that aren't fully on display in their more famous works. In doing so, you gain perspective and nuance that many others miss, and which is integral to an understanding of the author as a whole.That's why today, we look at lesser known works by five famous English-speaking authors on both sides of the Atlantic. Which have you already read, and which will you add to your list?Reminder: you can support our mission and get tons of members-only content for a few dollars per month:Full-length articles every Wednesday and SaturdayMembers-only podcasts and exclusive interviewsThe entire archive of great literature, art, and philosophy breakdownsIn the last year, we've written about everything from the quest for meaning in Homer's Odyssey, to why Tolkien hated Disney, to Dante's journey down the 9 levels of Hell...Subscribe now1) F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Beautiful and DamnedOvershadowed by both his debut novel This Side of Paradise and his magnum opus The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald's The Beautiful and Damned captures the American author at his most unfiltered.The book recounts the tragic tale of Anthony and Gloria Patch, a wealthy New York couple who get \"wrecked on the shoals of dissipation\" as they await an inheritance that never seems to arrive. It's a novel about wasted potential, dissolution, and the slow decay of privilege — all themes Fitzgerald would later refine, but here lets run loose as his voice takes shape.If Gatsby is Fitzgerald's monument to the American dream, then The Beautiful and Damned is his first attempt to dismantle it.2) C.S. Lewis, The Great DivorceUnlike the diabolical fun of The Screwtape Letters or the fairy-tale charm of Narnia, The Great Divorce is one of the stranger entries in Lewis's catalog — it is simultaneously wholesome and haunting.In it, Lewis imagines a fantastical bus ride from Hell to the outskirts of Heaven, where souls who reside in the former are allowed to step into the latter. Yet one by one, nearly all of them choose to return. One clings to his intellect, another to his bitterness. Each insists on keeping some part of the self, even if it costs them everything.The Great Divorce is Lewis's take on the idea that \"those who are in Hell choose to be there.\" It's a short, lucid, and piercing book that is a must-read if you want to explore his theology of the afterlife.3) J.R.R. Tolkien, Translation of Sir Gawain and the Green KnightLong before creating Middle-earth, Tolkien was a philologist with a deep love for medieval literature, and his translation of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight reflects that childhood passion.The poem itself, originally composed in the 14th century, is a marvel full of chivalric trials and mystical encounters. But Tolkien's version restores the musical cadence of the original, using a formal yet lyrical English that carries the weight of the past.The tale of Sir Gawain reveals to what extent medieval knights valued honor and virtue, and how temptation and pride threatened to destroy even the bravest among them. All of it is translated and recounted, of course, by a man who knew exactly how to make that kind of mythic wisdom translate to the modern era and speak to the soul.4) Mark Twain, Personal Recollections of Joan of ArcEasily Twain's least understood work, Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc seems like a bizarre entry in the author's catalog. For a man who was famously anti-French, anti-Catholic, and wrote almost exclusively about male protagonists, a female French saint seems like a most unlikely subject.Yet Twain considered Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc not only his best work, but the one which gave him the most joy to write. Under the surface, it is a subtle and clever (perhaps too clever) exposition of Twain's political philosophy, as well as being the final goodbye to his literary career.As for the figure of Joan herself, however, Twain simply had this to say:\"I studied that girl, Joan of Arc, for twelve years...and it never seemed to me that the artists and the writers gave us a true picture of her. They drew a picture of a peasant. But they always missed the face—the divine soul, the pure character, the supreme woman, the wonderful girl.\"5) John Milton, Italian Sonnets & Paradise RegainedThough overshadowed by Paradise Lost, Milton's lesser-known works offer a wonderful dive into the Restoration-era poet's intellectual depths. His Italian sonnets — as in, sonnets he wrote in Italian — reveal a poet in dialogue not just with his English predecessors, but with all-time greats such as Petrarch and Dante.Paradise Regained, meanwhile, serves as a sequel to Paradise Lost, recounting Christ's temptation in the desert. It lacks the cosmic sweep of the earlier work, but its restraint is deliberate: it highlights that where Adam falls, Christ endures.

I was heartened by how many of you asked about editing, revision, and structure—unglamorous but essential parts of writing. Anyone who's taken a workshop with me knows that I believe learning how structure works—especially reading closely for structure in its more intuitive forms—is the key to becoming a better and more successful writer.I haven't tackled everyone's question yet. I'll do another post soon on all these questions as they apply to poetry, as well as one on submitting pitches and pieces, organizing writing time, research for a trade book, and much more. But here is a start: some thoughts on how I think through these issues in my own projects and as a magazine editor. (The deeper dive—complete with index cards, Nancy Drew, and the messy middle—is for paying subscribers. Writing these posts takes time away from my own writing, so thank you for supporting them.)How to revise...Where do you start building a piece or a book?Early in a project, I generate material and read widely around it, jotting notes by hand and on my phone. I'm listening for the question I'm really asking, or for a crisper formulation of what interests me—what I want to try to say whether explicitly (in essays and criticism), or more metaphorically (in poems or lyric essays).As scenes and beats emerge, I start thinking about structure. For a book-length project, I sketch an outline in Google Docs and break out my favorite organizational tool: colored index cards. Each color has a function: yellow might be the present-day thread; green, an alternate narrative line; blue, the research points I don't want to neglect; orange, the hard-won formulations or metaphors that feel like keystones. Spreading them across my office floor lets me see the whole.Meghan O'Rourke's Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.In a first draft, I'm focused simply on generating, taking risks, and having some fun—if I'm not interested in what I'm writing, no one else will be.When I have a draft of some kind, I work on structure: pacing, tone, transitions. Years ago, while writing New Yorker piece about Nancy Drew's inventor, Edward Stratemeyer, I learned that he instructed his ghostwriters to end every chapter with an exclamation point or a question mark. That simple trick trained young readers to keep turning the pages. Since then, I've thought about suspense and propulsion as key elements of even literary nonfiction. While writing The Invisible Kingdom, I ended each section with a realization or question to propel the reader into the next. Detective fiction, funnily enough, helped me structure a book about chronic illness, where I was concerned that readers might flag during long sections of research.Next are more specific some answers to your questions — things that I think every writer should understand about revision and self-editing. Your support allows me to write these posts—thank you. Read more",

The more daring were dressed in recent runway ensembles, some of which made walking perilous and moving through narrow doorways a high-class geometry problem.

Artist Amy Sherald was, perhaps, the most subdued of the group. She wore gray and white plaid trousers with a matching midriff-baring jacket that she tugged on gently, like a delighted child in her first-day-of-school finery.

      "content": "There are ACX meetup groups all over the world. Lots of people are vaguely interested, but don't try going to a meetup until I make a big deal about it on the blog. Since learning that, I've tried to make a big deal about it on the blog twice annually, and it's that time of year again.If you're willing to run a meetup for your city, please fill out the organizer form.Here's the plan:Interested organizers fill out the form by August 23rd.The list of meetups gets posted around August 24th.ACX Everywhere Meetups can take place anytime between September 1st and October 31st.People enjoy each other's company and keep having meetups throughout the year.The form will ask you to pick a location, time, and date, and to provide an email address where people can reach you for questions. It will also ask a few short questions about how excited you are to run the meetup to help pick between multiple organizers in the same city. One meetup per city will be advertised on the blog, and people can email you if they have questions. Organizing an ACX Everywhere meetup can be easy. Pick a time and a place (parks work well if you think there will be a lot of people, cafes or apartments work fine for fewer) and show up with a sign saying \"ACX Meetup.\" You don't need to have discussion plans or a group activity. If you want to make the experience better for people, you can bring nice things like nametags/markers, food/drinks, or games. Meetups Czar Skyler can reimburse you for the nametags, markers, food, and drinks.If you feel more ambitious, collect people's names and emails if they're interested in future meetups. You could do this with a pen and paper, or if you're concerned about reading people's handwriting you could use a QR code/bitly link to a Google Form.Here's a short FAQ for potential meetup organizers:1. How do I know if I would be a good meetup organizer?If you can put a name/time/date in a box on Google Forms and show up there, you have the minimum skill necessary to be a meetup organizer for your city, and I recommend you sign up.Don't worry, you signing up won't randomly take the job away from someone else. The form will ask people how excited/qualified they are about being an organizer, and if there are many options, I'll choose whoever I think is best. (Or whoever Meetup Czar Skyler thinks is best.) But a lot of cities might not have an excited/qualified person, in which case I would rather the unexcited/unqualified people sign up, than have nobody available at all. This spreadsheet shows the cities where someone has filled out the form, updated manually after a basic check.Lots of cities have existing meetup groups and we'll probably prioritize them, but we always appreciate more options. Sometimes people assume their city is big enough that someone else will do it, nobody signs up before the announcement, and then afterwards people say they wish there was a meetup in their city. Beware the Bystander Effect!If you are the leader of your city's existing meetup group, please fill in the form anyway and say so.2. How will people hear about the meetup?You give me the information, and on August 24 (or so), I'll post it on ACX. An event will also be created on LessWrong's Community page.3. When should I plan the meetup for?Since I'll post the list of meetup times and dates around August 24, please choose sometime after that. Any day September 1st through October 31st is okay. I recommend a weekend, since it's when most people are available. You'll probably get more attendance if you schedule for at least one week out, but not so far out that people will forget - so mid September or early October would be best. Check your local calendar for holidays where people might be busy: If you're in the US, that probably means avoid Labor Day and Halloween.4. How many people should I expect?Last spring, meetups ranged from one person (just the organizer) to around two hundred. Meetups in big US cities (especially ones with universities or tech hubs) had the most people; meetups in non-English-speaking countries had the fewest. You can see a list of every city and how many people most of them got last time here. (If it's blank, it means either no ACX Everywhere was run or we didn't get a count of attendees in the post-event survey.`) Plan accordingly.5. Where should I hold the meetup?A good venue should be easy for people to get to, not too loud, and have basic things like places to sit, access to toilets, and the option of acquiring food and water. City parks and mall common areas work well. If you want to hold the meetup at your house, remember that this will involve me posting your address on the Internet.6. What should I do at the meetup?Mostly people just show up and talk. If you're worried about this not going well, here are some things that can help:Have people indicate topics they're interested in by writing something on their nametagBring a list of icebreakers / conversation starters (e.g. \"What have you been excited about recently?\" or \"How did you find the blog?\" or \"How many feet of giraffe neck do you think there are in the world?\")Bring one extroverted friend who's read the blogIn general I would warn against trying to impose mandatory activities (e.g. \"now we're all going to sit down and watch a PowerPoint presentation\"), but it's fine to give people the option to do something other than freeform socializing (e.g. \"go over to that table if you want to play a game\").It's also useful to have a signup sheet for a local mailing list or other way to announce meetups in the future, but this is optional both for the organizers and the attendees. Look at point 8 for more information about this. It can also be nice to include a checkbox on the signup sheet for adjacent local groups if your city happens to have those.7. Is it okay if I already have an existing meetup group?Yes. If you run an existing ACX meetup group, just choose one of your meetings which you'd like me to advertise on my blog as the official meetup for your city, and be prepared to have a larger-than-normal attendance who might want to do generic-new-people things that day.If you're a LW, EA, or other affiliated community meetup group, consider carefully whether you want to be affiliated with ACX. If you decide yes, that's fine, but I might still choose an ACX-specific meetup over you, if I find one. I guess this would depend on whether you're primarily a social group (good for this purpose) vs. a practical group that does rationality/altruism/etc activism (good for you, but not really appropriate for what I'm trying to do here). I'll ask about this on the form.8. If this works, am I committing to continuing to organize meetup groups forever for my city?The short answer is no.The long answer is no, but running more meetups seems like the sort of thing somebody should do. Many cities already have permanent meetup groups. For the others, I'll prioritize would-be organizers who are interested in starting one. If you end up organizing one meetup but not being interested in starting a longer-term group, see if you can find someone at the meetup who you can hand this responsibility off to.I know it sounds weird, but due to the way human psychology works, once you're the meetup organizer people are going to respect you, coordinate around you, and be wary of doing anything on their own initiative lest they step on your toes. If you can just bang something loudly at the meetup, get everyone's attention, and say \"HEY, ANYONE WANT TO BECOME A REGULAR MEETUP ORGANIZER?\", somebody might say yes, even if they would never dream of asking you on their own and wouldn't have decided to run things without someone offering.9. Are you (Scott) going to come to some of the meetups?I have in the past and had a lot of fun, but also found it pretty tiring. Since I expect to have less time and energy for travel, I'll probably just attend the local one in Berkeley. Again, you can find the meetup organizer volunteer form here. If you want to know if anyone has signed up to run a meetup for your city, you can view that here. Everyone else, just wait until 8/24 and I'll give you more information on where to go then.10. What if I have other questions?Skyler and I will read the comments here.",

Paul Krugman, Understanding Inequality: Part IIA Trumpian Diversion. Paul Krugman, Understanding Inequality: Part IIIOligarchs and the Rise of Mega-Fortunes. Paul Krugman, Understanding Inequality: Part IVPredatory Financialization. Paul Krugman, Understanding Inequality: Part VNow on to my subject.The great majority of economists, in both the academic and business worlds, believe that Donald Trump is pursuing destructive economic policies. He has imposed high tariffs, undoing the effects of 90 years of trade negotiations. His deportation policies are already creating labor shortages and supply disruptions in multiple sectors of the economy. His Big Beautiful Budget Bill, aside from being cruel, is fiscally irresponsible. Deportations will undermine Social Security and Medicare. His drastic cuts to scientific research will undermine U.S. technology, and hence long-run economic growth.Yet after briefly plunging when Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs, stock prices have fully recovered. So I am often asked how this is possible. If Trump's policies are so bad, how can the stocks be up?My usual response is \"I don't give investment advice.\" I may follow that up by quoting Paul Samuelson's famous quip that the market had predicted nine of the last five recession.But I thought it might be useful to say a bit more about how to reconcile the resilience of stocks with analysis showing that Trumponomics is very bad.First, the long version of Samuelson's quip: Stocks are not now and have never been useful predictors of the business cycle. Even when there were good reasons to be worried about a coming downturn, it's very hard to find cases in which the stock market gave advance warning.The way I see it, during any given period the market is driven by a narrative, positive or negative. The current narrative is strongly driven by optimism about AI. And it takes a major shock to change a market narrative. Nothing in history suggests that we should expect a really strong stock market reaction to the kinds of warnings we're getting so far about Trumponomics.Speaking of which: While Trump's tariffs are very bad, there is — as I wrote in Sunday's primer — a tendency, among both economists and other observers, to exaggerate the damage done by protectionism. Uncertainty about tariffs is definitely depressing business spending in the short run, but in that primer I estimated that Smoot-Hawley 2.0 will reduce long-run U.S. real GDP by 0.4 percent. The Yale Budget Lab, with a more elaborate model, comes up with very similar numbers:Source: Yale Budget LabNow, losing 0.4 percent of GDP forever is a big deal. But it's not so big that it's hard to imagine other factors boosting stocks enough that the market goes up rather than down. I'd argue that other Trump policies, especially the evisceration of U.S. science, will eventually have much bigger negative effects on growth. But as I've suggested, the stock market is a lot less forward-looking than people imagine, and you wouldn't expect these disastrous long-run policies to show up in today's S&P 500.Finally, Trump isn't the only thing driving the economy and the market right now. As I mentioned, the current market narrative is largely driven by AI. And as it happens, Trump's economic reign of error has coincided with a huge surge in investment related to AI. Here's real spending on information processing equipment, which basically reflects the frantic construction of data centers:It turns out that this investment surge accounts for about half of U.S. economic growth in the first half of 2025. Without that surge we'd probably be looking at an economy at stall speed, that is, growing so slowly that it could easily slip into recession. And while stocks rarely predict recessions, they usually slump when recessions hit.So if you ask why Trumponomics hasn't caused a stock crash, one answer is that many of the market effects of Trump's policies have been masked by the AI boom. In fact, there's a pretty good case that if Trump hadn't won and implemented his tariffs, we'd currently be dealing with overheating driven by AI spending.Does this portend a future recession when the AI bubble bursts? Maybe. But that will have to be the subject of a future post, or maybe several posts.Back to the question of how stocks can be up in the face of bad economic policies. To summarize my argument:· The stock market isn't actually a good predictor of the economy· Trump's policies are bad, but their medium-term adverse impact won't be as big as many imagine· The AI boom/bubble is masking some of the effects of bad policyWe'll be paying for Trump's bad policies for a very long time. But there's no contradiction between that reality and a stock market that is holding up, at least for now.MUSICAL CODAActually, do worry. But try to be happy anyway.",

      "content": "Last week was a real roller coaster of economic news. It started with MAGA taking an undeserved victory lap over second quarter economic data and ended with the president intemperately firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics over some bad jobs numbers. The irony of it, to the extent that one can find amusement in the torching of American institutions, is that just as the gross domestic product numbers weren't particularly good, the jobs numbers weren't particularly bad. By the same token, while the various trade \"deals\" the administration has been trumpeting aren't nearly as good as they're saying, it is true that they have successfully averted the worst-case scenarios that seemed possible in the immediate wake of Liberation Day. The upshot of all of this is that Trump is obsessed with superficial indicators of success. He's avoided stock market backlash to his trade policies by ensuring that whatever else gets trampled amidst the tariff wars, the AI investment boom is still on track. He's spinning economic numbers where he can and moving to suppress data where he can't. And in addition to political meddling, he's continuing a pattern of funding cuts that make it hard for statistical agencies to function. The tariffs aren't going to blow up America's biggest and most successful companies, but they will exert an ongoing drag on all kinds of businesses that don't have the clout to successfully beg for exemptions. America's tax system and social safety net have become much less favorable for the poor. And termites are eating away at the long-term sources of American economic strength.Subscribe nowThe economy is slowing down MAGA world reacted with great excitement to the news that GDP rose at a 3 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 2025. But this good second quarter just offsets a terrible first quarter. Now, if you were alive in the United States of America back in March, you probably don't remember any visible signs of a recession. People weren't losing jobs in droves. There was a lot of freaking out about tariffs, but no actual economic calamity. And that freaking out is exactly what you see in the data. In the first quarter, a lot of companies were importing stuff they didn't actually use or sell in order to get ahead of the tariffs, and this showed up as GDP shrinking. Then in the second quarter, we got a bounce-back. But across the entire first half of the year, the economy grew at a slower pace than in 2024 — and at a slower pace than was predicted before Trump took office. Last week's bad jobs report, which showed anemic employment growth over the past several months, confirms this same trend: the economy is slowing. I would note that there's no big mystery about what's happening here. If you ignore economic data and look at immigration data (which, unfortunately, is not measured as precisely or as frequently), the White House is happy to brag that it has transformed immigration from a major source of labor force growth to a slight drag. MAGA fans get defensive when you point this out. But slow growth in aggregate employment and a negative hit to GDP growth are obvious results of this policy choice.If you think this tradeoff is worthwhile because you believe having fewer immigrants creates benefits elsewhere on the ledger, then fine. But it's genuinely absurd to get mad at the Bureau of Labor Statistics for pointing out that immigration cuts and mass deportation show up in the jobs numbers. One way of looking at this is that the robust job growth during the Biden years didn't have the political benefits you might expect because a large share of those jobs went to non-citizens who couldn't vote. And the anemic job growth of Trump's second term hasn't collapsed his political standing because, again, this is mostly a question of people who can't vote no longer getting hired. But flipping this around raises the question of why the Trump administration is so convinced that the Fed should lower interest rates. Inflation is still running above the Fed's 2 percent target level and has, in fact, gone up recently. Even if you think monetary policy should ignore the impact of tariffs, it's hard to see the case for a cut. It's true that job growth is slowing down sharply, but that's not because of weak demand; it's because the administration is strangling labor force growth. It's never been clear to me what Trump's team thought would happen if they pulled off their immigration policies. Grandma's going to come out of retirement to pick up day labor gigs? Residents of depressed former manufacturing towns are going to move to coastal metro areas and work as nannies? From my baseline of pessimism toward their policies, I'd say that things are working out okay. But a slowing economy with upward pressure on prices and interest rates is what \"okay\" looks like. Trump's tariff deals are badDuring the 2024 campaign, Trump's platform included a 10 percent tax on all imports. This was a dumb idea, a massively regressive tax that would have a negative impact on American exporters, and it was widely criticized at the time. The Trump administration's business community supporters would often claim that it was just a negotiating tactic — Trump was going to \"escalate to de-escalate\" and win big market access concessions for American companies. Once in office, he began imposing tariffs that were actually more draconian than the 10 percent campaign pledge. But he did say that he was going to try to negotiate deals. Now, as the text of some of those deals is coming out, we're seeing a few things. One is that Trump is securing some market access wins for American companies. But another is that he is not interested in negotiating \"zero for zero\" deals where trade ends up freer than it was before. Typically, Trump is reaching asymmetrical agreements where the United States will, for example, impose higher tariffs on EU exports than the EU imposes on us and the EU agrees not to retaliate. This is pretty impressive as a feat of negotiating, and I do think it serves as a reminder that it's dangerous to underestimate Trump. He is credibly willing to engage in tit-for-tat escalations that are bad for everyone, and this gets other countries to make settlements with him that are in some sense \"unfair\" or \"lopsided.\"But this success just raises the question of why the United States would find the arrangement desirable.I think the answer, from Trump's perspective, is that tariffs concentrate a lot of power in his hands personally. Trump is able to grant exemptions to politically connected companies, and this is good for his personal quest for power and enrichment. But it's still a bad dynamic for America. Take this guy from the Montana Knife Company, who initially reacted with enthusiasm to tariffs because they would boost his made-in-America products ... only to discover that his costs are rising due to tariffs because he relies on imported equipment and supplies. And Montana Knife Company is almost certainly not in a position to lobby for exemptions. The initial freakout over Liberation Day tariffs represented a concern about a total breakdown of global trade. What Trump has secured with his deals is a guarantee that big successful American companies such as NVIDIA, Meta, Alphabet, and Netflix won't be torn apart by retaliatory measures. This is the dominant consideration for the stock market, which is mostly driven by the prices of the biggest and most successful companies. But I do have to note the irony that the endgame of this entire \"populist\" arc is to skew the American economic model even more sharply toward companies offering intangible services in tech and finance and away from manufacturers, whose competitiveness will be hurt by disrupted supply chains. Tariff policy as tax policyOne concern I've heard lately is that even if tariffs are bad trade policy, the sheer revenue impact will make them difficult for future administrations to repeal. I think it's way too soon to make a forecast like that — the politics of the next few years are too hard to predict. But I do think it's worth talking through the merits. Tariff revenue is now a non-trivial piece of the economic pie. It is also, per this Yale Budget Lab analysis, incredibly bad for poor people. If Democrats want to make economic policies that are good for poor people, I think this makes tariff repeal a compelling agenda item. On the revenue point, it's true that offsetting tariff repeal with some new tax will be politically challenging, but raising taxes is always hard. And this one seems like an easier political win than fighting poverty with new spending. Political speculations aside, though, I think we need to understand clearly what it is Trump's doing here. There's no great boom in American manufacturing jobs or championing of the working class. Trump passed a regressive tax cut and offset part of the cost by cutting Medicaid and nutritional assistance. Now, he's offsetting another part of that cost by raising taxes on the poor. After the initial tariff rollout was panned by financial markets, he put a lot of time and energy into negotiating deals that have safeguarded the interests of big technology and financial services companies, while continuing to harm lower-income consumers, small businesses, and manufacturing. And it only gets worse from here. Eating America's seed cornFiring the BLS commissioner over a couple of unfavorable downward revisions would be bad enough, but of course, Trump can't help but also smear the work of the commissioner and the agency as he does it. The whole idea that releasing timely information and then revising it as more data becomes available represents \"incompetence\" is absurd. If Trump has ideas about how to make the estimates more precise, I'm sure they'd be welcome. But he doesn't. Back in June, the Trump administration proposed huge cuts to the budgets of BLS and other statistical agencies. These are distinct issues, but in both cases we see an administration that fundamentally has no appreciation for the value of credible and timely economic statistics. I know a lot of people questioned whether Trump would cook the books during his first term, and the answer from knowledgeable sources was always that the statistical procedures were hard to meddle with politically and that you'd see clear evidence of meddling if it happened. Today, I'm worried this is what the start of that meddling looks like. I don't think we can say that next month's numbers are going to be cooked, but how about three or four months from now? And this is the pattern across the board. Decisions about everything from tariff policy to merger approval to the targeting of immigration enforcement to who runs federal statistical agencies are being made on a nakedly partisan basis. There's an old Adam Smith line about how \"there is a great deal of ruin in a nation,\" and a prosperous country like the United States can survive a lot of bad policies. I don't think Trump's approach to trade and immigration is good, but I am optimistic that it won't cause long-term damage to the country. Hopefully, a future administration will establish an immigration regime that is more humane and growth-friendly than Trump's, but also more orderly and secure than Biden's. It's normal for policies to ping-pong a little as we try to reach sensible outcomes. What's not fine is if the president reacts to the news that shrinking the labor force slows job growth by wrecking the integrity of the jobs report. Or if foreign countries decide to re-evaluate the view that the United States of America is a friendly hegemon relative to the People's Republic of China. In the short term, demand for data center construction can keep powering the economy forward one way or another, but investment booms always come to an end, and the wreckage Trump is making is going to be very hard to fix.Share",

But new information emerges when scientists can get their hands on more than 4.3 million butterfly observations taken over more than three decades. The massive dataset, collected across the United States Midwest, contained counts of more than 136 different species, including monarchs and swallowtails. The outlook for these pollinators is not sunny.“We expected to find that at least some species had done well over the past 32 years,” said Wendy Leuenberger, a Ph.D. candidate at Michigan State University, in a statement. This was not the case. Not one of the species grew in population numbers—and 43 percent of the species declined in that period. “While most of the common species like monarchs and cabbage whites are still present, you wouldn’t see nearly as many of them as in 1992. You’re less likely to spot rare species as well,” she said.The findings were made possible by massive amounts of volunteer hours—some 90,000—and strict protocols maintained over the years so that the data could be compared across decades, said the lead study author, Elise Zipkin, director of Michigan State University’s Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior Program. The paper was published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Butterflies, along with moths, are key pollinators and are sensitive to environmental disruptions, including climate change, pesticides, and habitat destruction. Considering the substantial shift in the numbers of these charismatic animals, Leuenberger added: “These are all changes that have occurred in my lifetime, which is humbling.”The efforts to track and better understand butterfly populations continue—often similarly underpinned by help from community volunteers.

The researchers wanted to know if he would let them record the to-and-fro-ing of his sheepdogs. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The farmer couldn’t fathom what the scientists might learn about the abstractions of physics by studying his muddy canines, but he agreed. Not long afterward Bhamla and Chakrabortty, who study collective behavior, pulled up to Ivie’s farm to watch the dogs in action. That day, the farm was hosting a sheepdog trial, a centuries-old competition in which sheepdogs show off their herding skills by steering small flocks of sheep across a field, as well as splitting the group, known as “shedding,” among other tasks.Physicists have studied sheepdog herding for decades, but they have mostly modeled how the dogs gather up large herds, Bhamla says. In these large herds, sheep display what’s known as selfish flocking behavior, gravitating toward the center and putting others between themselves and danger. But in smaller groups, as in sheepdog trials, their decisions become more erratic, as they waver between following the flock or heading off on their own. How the sheepdogs manage to get the sheep to go where they want under these chaotic conditions suggests a solution to a tough problem in physics—controlling noisy, unpredictable collectives, which is relevant not just to sheep, but also to drone and robotic swarms and pedestrian movements, among other things. Such emergent collectives are driven by both group-level patterns and by interactions between individual members of the group. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Instead of suppressing randomness, they found, the sheepdogs seemed to embrace it.“Dogs do amazing things, so naturally we were interested,” says Bhamla. After their visit to the farm, Bhamla and Chakrabortty gathered a series of recordings of sheepdog trials from YouTube videos. As they looked for patterns in the recordings and talked with sheepdog handlers, they noticed that both herding and shedding boiled down to a two-step process. In the first step, the dog nudges the sheep gently from a distance without inducing panic, waiting for them to face in the desired direction. In the second step, the dog approaches, increasing the threat to get the sheep to move; instinctively, they flee from the perceived predator in the direction they are facing.The next challenge for the physicists was translating what they had learned into a mathematical model. Their model included five sheep who changed orientation either in response to a social influence (copying their neighbor), or in response to outside force, such as a dog or a handler. Which influence they chose to respond to was determined at random, though individual sheep were programmed to be more or less responsive to dogs and handlers. The dogs in the model also followed the same two-step process as in real life, first nudging and then moving. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The scientists found that although random behavior is typically considered an obstacle to controlling a small collective, the indecisiveness of the sheep was actually a benefit to the dogs in the “splitting” task. The dogs could simply wait until the sheep were facing in the direction they wanted before closing in, limiting the effort required. Instead of suppressing randomness, they found, the sheepdogs seemed to embrace it.Based on these findings, the scientists built an algorithm that could be used to predict behavior in other small indecisive behavior-switching collectives. The results, which have not yet been peer-reviewed, were published in June on the preprint server arXiv.Ted Pavlic, a computational biologist and professor at Arizona State University said the findings could apply to any situation where someone needs to guide a group of individuals with whom they can’t directly communicate. “When I’m developing a strategy for a group of individuals that I want to steer, I would assume consistent behavior from all of them,” says Pavlic. “This shows that maybe that’s not the best strategy.”But Pavlic notes limitations in the model, particularly in how it represents real sheep. For example, the model sheep don’t avoid collisions and can pass through one another. They also don’t remember where they’ve been. “It would be interesting to see what they find if they add these things to the model,” he says. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Raissa D’Souza, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of California, Davis, praised the scientists’ clever use of real world data and agreed that the findings could be useful in the context of robot swarms, particularly for search and rescue. But she pointed out that the results only apply to a very specific type of physics problem—small noisy systems that feature random switching between two states—and don’t generalize over all examples of small, noisy collectives.Bhamla and Chakrabortty agree that there’s much to learn. In the future, they hope to explore further how individual sheep behavior influences the outcomes. “Animals are so complicated. We’re still just scratching the surface,” Bhamla says. “What I find amazing is that we’ve taken such a seemingly simple competition and made a whole story about it,” Bhamla says. “How beautiful is that?” Lead photo: Alexandra Morrison Photo / ShutterstockThe post The Magic of Herding appeared first on Nautilus.",

      "content": "Today, instead of writing about economics as usual, I thought I'd do a culture post. I've given my lists of favorite sci-fi novels and anime series, so I thought I'd do another list — my favorite immigrant memoir comics.Immigrant memoir comics are my guilty pleasure. I just can't get enough of reading about the immigrant experience, and I find that graphic novelists often talk about their lives more plainly and truthfully than standard novelists. Interestingly, these comics will give you a broad range of immigrant perspectives — people who love America and do well here, people who reject America or suffer life setbacks, and people who simply tolerate it because they have to. Reading comics like this is a great (and pretty quick) way to understand the truth about the people who come to America. In the current political climate, I think it's especially important that we understand this. So anyway, here are the thirteen best immigrant memoir comics I've read. Mexikid, by Pedro MartínFor me, this is the ultimate graphic novel about the immigrant experience, even though the protagonist (the author himself) is not an immigrant himself, and the story mostly takes place in Mexico. The author was born in the U.S., but his parents and some of his (many) siblings were born in Mexico, so the family basically straddles the two countries — culturally, and sometimes physically. Mexikid is the story of how Pedro and his family drive to Mexico to fetch Pedro's grandfather, who has become something of a legendary figure within the family due his exploits during the Mexican Civil War. There are several reasons why this comic is so amazing. There are some authors who just have this natural talent for telling stories that depict the world through the eyes of a child — Bill Watterson of Calvin and Hobbes is one of them, and Pedro Martín is another. The story deals with a lot of dark things — war, poverty, child labor and so on. Pedro's father even admits to having been an illegal immigrant, before receiving amnesty in 1986. But because the protagonist is a happy kid who can't quite tell reality from fantasy, even the darker elements are dealt with in a cheerful, cartoonish way. Somehow there's an overwhelming sense of positivity and optimism.And the source of that optimism is America itself. Even though the story takes place in Mexico, the author never wastes a chance to show how American culture — from superheroes to musicals to TV shows — pervades everything that these Mexican-American kids love. Behind this, there's the knowledge that America welcomed this family in, saved them from violence, and gave them security in exchange for hard work. And in return, they give America their love. Mexikid's art reinforces this sunny optimism. It's probably the best visual depiction of the southwestern desert that I've ever seen in a comic. Everything is brightly colored, drenched in sun, with wide-open skies — a metaphor for the wide-open possibilities of generations of life in America. If you want a graphic novel to make you feel good about immigration, this is it. I Was Their American Dream: A Graphic Memoir, by Malaka GharibI Was Their American Dream follows an archetype that has basically become the staple of the immigrant memoir genre — the story of a kid who come to America at a young age, and struggles to fit in at school while also dealing with their parents' old-world quirks and problems. Malaka Gharib executes this in fine form, telling the story of her mixed Egyptian-Filipino family with humor and warmth, and adding plenty of informative cultural context.Of all the immigrant memoir comics I read, this one was the most unambiguously positive. America never wrongs or excludes the protagonist in any way — she finds a way to fit in at school just as easily as any white kid in the 80s or 90s, and then she goes to college and has fun there too. Her parents get divorced, and her dad moves back to Egypt for a better job, but America remains the land of promise, wealth, and safety. The art is pretty cartoonish, but it adds to the generally silly fun tone. Racial exclusion barely comes up. The protagonist/author grows up in an immigrant \"ethnoburb\" in Southern California where there are almost no white people, so white people are simply exotic and interesting to her, rather than dominant and threatening. When she first encounters white people en masse, it's as a college student, and while they can sometimes be obtuse, she generally views them as fun and even exotic.1 Overall, if you want a story of successful middle-class immigration, this is a good pick. There's also a sequel called It Won't Always Be Like This, about the author's time visiting her father in Egypt. Almost American Girl: A Graphic Memoir, by Robin HaThis one has a similar title to I Was Their American Dream, and it also has a very similar storyline. But it's a significantly darker story — the author/protagonist grows up with a poor single mother from Korea, and struggles to fit in due to her limited English skills and general shyness. These challenges are exacerbated when the family is forced to move to Huntsville, Alabama — not the most welcoming place for nonwhite foreigners, at least at the time. Still, it's a triumphant story in the end. The family moves to Virginia, where a more diverse student body at Robin's high school puts her more at ease and makes it easier to find friends. Interestingly, Japanese comics emerge as a social glue that binds together American kids of various ethnicities (something that, as an observer of weeb culture, I've often remarked on). Ultimately, these things help Robin ease into American identity; at the end, after a trip to Korea, she realizes that she's fundamentally American, and goes back home more optimistic and satisfied with her identity. There are definitely important lessons here about how to speed assimilation and the adoption of American identity, if people are willing to pay attention. The art is also very beautiful, in an understated way. They Called Us Enemy, by George TakeiIf the previous three comics were the most happy and triumphant stories about immigration, this is the most horrifying. It's a first-hand account of how Japanese Americans were forced out of their homes and thrown into racial concentration camps during World War 2. There are plenty of memoirs about concentration camps, but this one takes place in America, the Land of the Free, and so to an American reader it hits very hard.Still, the story manages to end on a hopeful, positive note. The author/protagonist, George Takei, ends up becoming a famous actor (he plays Sulu on the original Star Trek), winning a kind of representation that would never have been possible before or during the war. And the U.S. government eventually pays reparations to the Japanese Americans it wronged. Takei intentionally presents the vision of a America as a self-improving nation — a place that always had promise, and that progressively fulfills more and more of that promise over time. Just Another Story: A Graphic Migration Account, by Ernesto SaadeThis is the best comic I've read about illegal immigration. It's about a Salvadoran boy (the author's cousin) whose mother decides to take him to America to escape desperate poverty and the constant threat of violence in El Salvador. The story is gripping, tense, and harrowing — it feels like Lord of the Rings, with hobbits sneaking across Mordor. The main danger is not the U.S. Border Patrol, but the various criminals who try to exploit, rob, kidnap, or murder would-be illegal immigrants headed north. In the end, they make it, but only barely, and they're emotionally scarred for life by the journey. If you want to understand what's really at stake when people immigrate illegally, and what they have to face in order to do so, this is a good lesson. In Limbo, by Deb JJ LeeThis is certainly one of the most beautifully written graphic novels in this list, and certainly the most beautifully illustrated. It's in black and white, but every page feels like a work of art. Unfortunately, this is also a story about depression and child abuse. American life, institutions, and culture present zero obstacle to the author/protagonist — in fact, Americans are generally presented as helpful, caring, and well-intentioned. Instead, the entire challenge comes from the protagonist's troubled family, and from her own spiraling mental illness. (She's also gay and bad at school, which don't exactly help the situation at home.)It's still quintessentially an immigrant story, because it's about how second-generation Americans tend to have very little support system outside their families; when those families are dysfunctional, they're often trapped, with no one they can easily turn to. That's a thing people without immigrant families tend to forget. The Best We Could Do: An Illustrated Memoir, by Thi BuiThis is the most famous of another subgenre of immigrant memoir comics: the Vietnam War refugee memoir. Other examples of this include Thien Pham's Family Style (which I liked, and which is similar to The Best We Could Do but more upbeat), and GB Tran's Vietnamerica (which was such a faithfully factual account that it didn't end up telling much of a coherent story). The Best We Could Do tells the harrowing story of a family of refugees from South Vietnam — what life was like in Vietnam before and during the war, how the family escaped on a boat and made it to the U.S., and their struggles with life in the U.S. as impoverished refugees. It doesn't depict America as a land of promise or aspiration, but as a desperate compromise. The family doesn't idolize America, but simply has nowhere else to go. Nor does America shower them with opportunity when they arrive; it's only through constant hard work, perseverance, and family unity that they manage to make it in their forbidding new home. Worm: A Cuban American Odyssey, by Edel RodriguezThis is another story about a refugee from a communist dictatorship — this time, Castro's Cuba. American leftists tend to have romantic fantasies about revolutionary Cuba, but Worm depicts an impoverished, slowly decaying country filled with fear, where neighbors rat on their neighbors and daily life is ruthlessly repressed. (The art style really compounds the feeling of anxiety.) The title refers both to a parasite that almost kills the author/protagonist, and to the protagonist's father, who is labeled a \"worm\" for daring to secretly oppose Castro. In the end, Rodriguez and his family escape Cuba on the famous 1980 Mariel Boatlift, and make it to America, where they succeed economically (after facing the usual challenges). The Rodriguez family idolizes America for saving them from a brutal dictatorship and giving them the opportunity to become middle-class. But then Trump gets elected, and the nation suddenly seems far less friendly to immigrants. A now-grown-up Rodriguez decides that Trump is similar to Castro, and decides to use his art to oppose Trump. Rodriguez creates what's probably still the most iconic political cartoon about Trump — an image of a melting, screaming, eyeless orange head that appeared on the cover of Time. It's not the happiest ending, but at least America is a place where dissidents can still go against the President in public — at least for now. Messy Roots: A Graphic Memoir of a Wuhanese American, by Laura GaoThis comic follows the same basic template as I Was Their American Dream and Almost American Girl — an immigrant kid struggling to fit in in school. But unlike those others, this isn't a triumphant story of assimilation; the author/protagonist suffers constant punishing, brutal social exclusion, which only gets worse after Covid (since her family is from Wuhan). Eventually she rejects the idea of America and travels back to China, but finds that she doesn't quite fit in there either. She ends on a hopeful note, declaring that she doesn't really belong anywhere, but it doesn't feel like a victory. Huda F. Cares?, by Huda FahmyIf rightists want to read a story about immigration that confirms all their worst fears, Huda F. Cares? will probably do nicely. It's a story about a deeply conservative, completely insular Muslim family who lives in America but is not fundamentally of America. They stick primarily to themselves, living out their traditionalist religious lifestyle in seclusion. Their family trip to Disneyland — the one time they let themselves venture outside their enclave — is the subject of the story, and yet almost none of the book is spent describing Disneyland at all. Instead, it's all about internal family dynamics. They do occasionally encounter Americans outside their family, but these are pretty much always presented as threats or opponents to be overcome. Regular Americans insult Huda's family and try to sexually harass the (conservatively dressed) women. When one of the girls is detained at the park for hitting a sexual harasser, the mother takes a video and threatens to summon the online mob against the park security, ultimately forcing them to let her daughter off the hook. At the end, the family decides that the world is always going to be against them, and that they have to stick together as a family to resist. This is presented as a hopeful conclusion, since the family ultimately puts aside their constant squabbling to unite against the outside world. But it's not the kind of story a lot of Americans would probably like to hear about immigration.Why Is Everybody Yelling?: Growing Up in My Immigrant Family, by Marisabina RussoThis is the only story on this list about European immigrants. It takes place in the postwar period, and follows a girl from a Jewish family who becomes a devout Catholic. The backdrop of the story is the Holocaust, and how it basically caused the entire family to have PTSD. It's interesting how similar this memoir is to the more modern-day ones on the list — the immigrant experience in America is more timeless than people realize. This reads much like a combination of the fish-out-of-water story of Almost American Girl with the refugee story of The Best We Could Do. I also really liked the art in this comic. It's richly textured and skillfully expressive.Uprooted: A Memoir About What Happens When Your Family Moves Back, by Ruth ChanThis one is interesting because it's a story of remigration — a Canadian girl whose parents move back to Hong Kong when she's a teenager, taking her with them. Part of the story is about how Ruth's ancestors escaped World War 2 to Hong Kong, and part of it is about how she struggles to fit in in her parents' country. Overall this is a very sweet and well-told story, and it demonstrates some of the commonalities of the immigrant experience across countries. It's notable, by the way, that the author later immigrated to America, and now lives in NYC, though she describes herself as a \"proud Canadian\". In this case, remigration didn't take; the pull of the New World is strong. Parachute Kids: A Graphic Novel, by Betty C. TangIncluding Parachute Kids is kind of cheating, because it's technically fictionalized and not a memoir. It's the story of a strange and slightly terrifying phenomenon called, well, \"parachute kids\" — kids from other countries whose parents drop them off in America with friends or relatives, who then pretend to be those kids' parents, so that the kids can grow up as U.S. citizens and act as anchor babies. This is kind of a crazy thing to do, and shows the desperate lengths to which people will go to give their kids the chance to be American. The reason I included it in the list is that it definitely feels like a lightly fictionalized memoir — the kind of thing you'd write as fiction if you didn't want to get anyone in trouble. Interestingly, despite the fraud and child abandonment, the story of the parachute kids is told as a hopeful, positive tale of resilience. Americans are almost always presented as friendly, helpful people, and the parachute kids themselves are resourceful and strong. In the end, they make it in America. Stories like this are a reminder that our immigration system is just too restrictive; people like the protagonists of Parachute Kids should have just been allowed to move in, without having to separate their family.

My thanks for your forbearance.The next Jane Austen book club will now be on 28th September not 7th September. On 14th September the Shakespeare book club will discuss All's Well That Ends Well.Summarising the Odyssey, Aristotle wrote:Thus the story of the Odyssey can be stated briefly. A certain man is absent from home for many years; he is jealously watched by Poseidon, and left desolate. Meanwhile his home is in a wretched plight—suitors are wasting his substance and plotting against his son. At length, tempest-tost, he himself arrives; he makes certain persons acquainted with him; he attacks the suitors with his own hand, and is himself preserved while he destroys them. This is the essence of the plot; the rest is episode.This is all well and good as far as it goes; but it is missing the most important thing about the Odyssey: it is a quest in which sons go in search of their fathers. Peter Leithart, summarising Ulysses, an Odyssean novel, says this:Stephen is looking for a father, and Bloom has lost his son. That broken paternal-filial setting comes from the Homeric background, with Stephen playing the role of Telemachus mourning an absent father. Throughout this book, this is overlaid with constant references to Hamlet. Stephen is a brooding Hamlet at the beginning of the story. He has lost his mother rather than his father, and sees her ghost. Stephen's family situation continues the story of Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, in which Stephen's search for a father, the rupture and reconciliation with a father is a key to his artistic development. Joyce understands. The Odyssey is about the fact that, in Athena's words, (in Daniel Mendelsohn's new translation), Few are the sons and heirs who can measure up to their fathers;Most are worse by far, and few are those who can best them.We think of the Odyssey as the tale of Odysseus's thwarted journey home. We think of him as the figure of the Tennyson poem,For always roaming with a hungry heartMuch have I seen and known; cities of menAnd manners, climates, councils, governments,Myself not least, but honour'd of them all;And drunk delight of battle with my peers,Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.This complicated man: he must love the journey. One reason he doesn't go back to Penelope more quickly, is because he is also going back to Laertes, his father. Once he has killed the suitors occupying his home, Odysseus continues his journey to Laertes.Meanwhile, OdysseusDrew close to the flourishing vineyard as he continued his search.But as he went down to the great orchard he failed to find DoliosOr his sons, or a single slave—it turned out they had gone offTo gather up stones from the field for a wall that would encloseThe orchard, and the old man was leading the way for them.But he did find his father, alone...His father, alone. Before going to look for his father, Odysseus tells his companions, \"I will go and put my father to the test/ To see if he'll recognise me...\" Odysseus finds Laertes, a former king, old and bent, wearing protective clothes while he gardens. This is one of the most moving passages in the whole poem. I shall quote first Samuel Butler's versionHe had on a dirty old shirt, patched and very shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him from the brambles, and he also wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat skin cap on his head, and was looking very woe-begone. When Ulysses saw him so worn, so old and full of sorrow, he stood still under a tall pear tree and began to weep. He doubted whether to embrace him, kiss him, and tell him all about his having come home, or whether he should first question him and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it best to be crafty with him...There is a plangent beauty to the plainness of this translation: to save him, woe-begone, so old and full of sorrow. But this scene can work, too, in a more highly wrought manner. Here is Pope.But all alone the hoary king he found;His habit coarse, but warmly wrapp'd around;His head, that bow'd with many a pensive care,Fenced with a double cap of goatskin hair:His buskins old, in former service torn,But well repair'd; and gloves against the thorn.In this array the kingly gardener stood,And clear'd a plant, encumber'd with its wood.Beneath a neighbouring tree, the chief divineGazed o'er his sire, retracing every line,The ruins of himself, now worn awayWith age, yet still majestic in decay!Sudden his eyes released their watery store;The much-enduring man could bear no more.Doubtful he stood, if instant to embraceHis aged limbs, to kiss his reverend face,With eager transport to disclose the whole,And pour at once the torrent of his soul.—Not so: his judgment takes the winding wayOf question distant, and of soft essay;More gentle methods on weak age employs:And moves the sorrows to enhance the joys.Hardly Pope's best work: but oh how moving! Odysseus plays a trick on Laertes, pretending to be someone else, and Laertes does not quite recognise him at first, due to all the time that has passed. Laertes asks this traveller if he has news of his son, and, hearing that he may be dead \"the father, with a father's fears\" says,That hapless guest, alas! for ever gone!Wretch that he was! and that I am! my son!If ever man to misery was born,'Twas his to suffer, and 'tis mine to mourn!Poor Laertes! If only the ingrate Odysseus knew what he was putting his father through! My favourite translation, E.V. Rieu shows the scene thus:When Laertes heard this, a black cloud of misery enveloped him. Groaning heavily, he picked the black dust up in both his hands and poured it over his grey head. Odysseus' heart was touched, and suddenly, as he watched his dear father, a sharp spasm of pain shot through his nostrils. He rushed forward, flung his arms round his neck, and kissed him. 'Father,' he cried, 'here I am, the very man you asked about, home in my own land after twenty years. But no more tears and lamentation, for I have news to tell you, and there is need for haste.'Odysseus has come home, seen his wife, established himself, and now, after his final honourable task—the killing of the suitors who are parasites on his house—he has come back to his father, the model of honour and kingship. Just as Telemachus looks to Odysseus, looks for Odysseus, so Odysseus ends up looking to Laertes. His pity is evoked because he suddenly sees himself in his father. Look again at these four lines from Pope.Beneath a neighbouring tree, the chief divineGazed o'er his sire, retracing every line,The ruins of himself, now worn awayWith age, yet still majestic in decay!See what Pope is saying: \"retracing every line,/ The ruins of himself\". Himself is presumably Laertes, a reference back to \"sire\"; but it can also be read as a reference to Odysseus, seeing himself in his ageing father. All the time that has passed is suddenly witnessed in the majestic decay of the old man. In Laertes ageing, Odysseus sees his own ageing. This ambiguity is missing from Butler, and from Mendelsohn, in their plain translations. Mendelsohn has:Thus, when the noble Odysseus, who'd endured so much, saw himWorn down by old age, his mind weighed down by grief, He went and stood by a lofty pear tree as his tears began to flow.Pope may not have intended the ambiguity, but it is surely there; even though Mendelsohn provides a standard account, it is missing this crucial element. The rest may be accurate to the passage, but Pope is true to the spirit of the whole poem. Tennyson's Ulysses says, of Telemachus, \"He works his work, I mine.\" But in fact, one of the final things written in the Odyssey is of the reunion of Odysseus, Laertes, and Telemachus, fighting together, as honour dictates.They were now joined by Athene, Daughter of Zeus, who had assumed Mentor's appearance and voice. The patient, good Odysseus was overjoyed to see her. He turned at once to his dear son and said: 'Telemachus, when you find yourself in the thick of battle, where the best men prove their mettle, you will soon learn how not to disgrace your father's house. In all the world there has been none like ours for courage and manliness.' And the thoughtful Telemachus replied: 'If you care to, father, you will see me in my present mood by no means disgracing my father's house, as you put it.' Laertes was delighted. 'Dear gods!' he exclaimed. 'What a day this is to warm my heart! My son and grandson competing in valour!'Fathers and sons are the predominant relationships of the Odyssey. The Odyssey begins with Telemachus deciding to go on a journey to find his father; indeed this is the subject of the first five books; and it ends with Odysseus coming home to discover his father, and all three of them united in valour. The first four books are full of discussion about Telemachus finding his father. At the end, when Odysseus tells Penelope the tale of his adventures — Kikones, Lotus Eaters, Cyclops, Aiolos— he says that \"fate would not yet let him reach/The beloved land of his forefathers\". When they fight the suitors, there is a small sequence that re-enacts in miniature this idea that the journey is towards the father:Amphinomos then burst out at glorious Odysseus.Darting in front of him, he pulled out his sharpened sword,Hoping to get Odysseus away from the door. But TelemakhosWas too quick: he dealt him a blow from behind with his bronze-tipped spear,Right between the shoulders, driving it straight through his chest.With a thunderous thud he fell, flat on his face, to the ground.Telemakhos sprang back up, leaving his long-shadowed spearRight there, inside Amphinomos—for he was terrified: what ifSome Achaean came out of nowhere and ran him through with a swordAs he pulled out the long-shadowed spear, or struck him down as he stopped there?So he started to run, and swiftly reached his beloved father.In his Introduction, Mendelsohn lists the other father-son relationships: Poseidon makes trouble for Odysseus because the Cyclops is his son; in Hades, Achilles asks Odysseus whether his son Neoptolemos has lived up to his expectations: \"Did he follow me into the war as the foremost fighter, or not?\" The final scene includes the fathers of the slain suitors, asking for justice. Mendelsohn calls this patriarchal, and perhaps it is; but that has been too much discussed in recent years; of course it is patriarchal: criticism wishes for knowledge that inhabits the poem, as well as taxonomising judgement.The Odyssey's many quests are one of literature's earliest instances of the great theme: the pursuit of happiness. And that pursuit is centred on what, from Athene's perspective in the first few books, is the whole impetus for the tale, and thus the aim of the poem: \"To learn something of your father\". As with all quests, the hero must come home, and see it all again as if for the first time, and know himself and it to be the same but also changed. He must see himself in his father and learn something of them both.",

To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.Hi Everyone,I have some exciting personal news this week: I have just started as the defence editor at the European Correspondent and kicked off the defence desk today with a story taking stock of where Europe stands six months after JD Vance came to the Munich Security Conference and declared a culture war on Europe. For the piece, I revisited some Substack contributions I've written in the past six months and was happy to note that the four steps I outlined here back in early March have all been taken: the €20 or 40 billion EU aid package for Ukraine did not happen but member states and EU institutions nevertheless very quickly filled the financial gap left by the US, the EU has agreed on a number of new instruments to fund and streamline defence investment and production, and the \"Danish model\" of directly funding Ukrainian defence industry has been adopted on the EU level.There is actually very little substance that warrants the doomerist pessimism that is so persistent in Europe (and about Europe). I hope you enjoy today's read.Yours,MinnaVolodymyr Zelenskyy reviews the progress of building defensive structures and fortifications in Kharkiv, 9 April 2024. Photo: President Of UkrainePessimism As a Self-Fulfilling ProphecyAhead of Trump's inauguration in January 2025, the Dutch journalist Caroline de Gruyter argued in Foreign Policy that Europe's biggest problem is not Trump, but pessimism. I could not have agreed with her more. There is a persistently negative bias in the discourse both in and about Europe. And the pessimism goes back years: as pointed out, the currently trending \"Europe's humiliation\" discourse has been around since at least 2019. That is probably the reason why narratives about Trump's policies, which consistently hurt US interests the most, are spun into signs of European weakness. And often also presented as Europe's fault, although the shame that Trump represents isn't really on Europe.While the danger of being overly optimistic is to be negatively surprised by developments you had not seen coming and therefore did not prepare for, pessimism can very easily turn into demoralising defeatism, if no credit is ever given where it is due. This is a particular responsibility for elites: political leaders, journalists, and analysts alike. The publics, in the best case, tend to trust what they say and form their own view of a probable future based on their assessments.The NATO Defence College just published this long report last week, looking into the question of societal resilience and how elite pessimism about society can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. I have discussed willingness to defend previously on the Europe Dispatch and exchanged views with the author Roderick Parkes while he was writing the report. We share the assessment that elite views of societies' ability to mobilise in a crisis or conflict are often overly pessimistic, and that in turn erodes public trust in our collective ability to raise to the occasion. At the same time, there is little material evidence that Europe, for example, is doomed to fail without the protection by the US. On the contrary: Europe has the money, the know-how, and the industry to tackle the challenge. The only thing stopping Europe is lack of faith.Parkes' main argument is the following (p. 7):\"Allies struggle to understand the societies they must mobilise. In war, it is impossible to know how many would fight, under what conditions, or why.This uncertainty breeds pessimism. In the absence of reliable data on societal resilience, planners default to cautious, worst-case assumptions.Elite pessimism suppresses societal will to fight. A government that does not trust its citizens to step up will avoid making demands of them – creating a self-fulfilling loss of resolve.The future is not just something to prepare for – it is something to shape. Just as pessimism can shape policy outcomes negatively, planners can use imagination to shape them in a positive way.The military must be built around the society of the future. Rather than forcing society into legacy structures, Allies should imagine where its strengths may emerge – and design forces to harness them.\"Trust goes both ways: in an optimal case, citizens trust authorities in their country of residence. But the authorities also have to trust citizens and see them as a resource, not a problem to be solved. Ukraine is perhaps the best case in point on how expectations can be proven wrong: even in the period leading up to the 2022 full-scale invasion, Ukrainian willingness to resist and fight was at 59 percent somewhat below the OECD average. But once the onslaught began, the whole society mobilised. In a similar vein, Parkes makes the point in the NDC report that making predictions about willingness to defend is more about anticipating future behaviour, shaped by extraordinary crisis circumstances, than the stated present (peacetime) reality:\"The task of analysts in this case is not to measure present reality but to anticipate future eventuality – to imagine how people may act in unprecedented situations. Accustomed to crisp metrics, analysts can struggle with the fluidity of collective will. They may not only misread it but, in so doing, help to erode it.\" (P. 19)Parkes also argues that while imagination, in addition to strategy and planning, used to be an integral part of Euro-Atlantic strategic culture, we have lost our imaginative ability in the recent decades. He therefore advocates for a reintegration of imagination, or what he calls the \"influencer\" approach, to the current strategizing and planning. (The report includes a questionnaire, from p. 12 onwards, which you can take to find out whether you are a strategist, a planner, or an influencer – or a rare combination of all three.) On pessimism, Parkes points out that \"negativity is a peacetime bias: in peacetime, the task is to make plans for the worst. In wartime, strategic assumptions collapse, and even the best-laid plans give way to improvisation. That is when imagination becomes essential, revealing new possibilities and sources for hope\" (p. 36). Ukrainians have shown what a level of creativity lack of options in an existential emergency can unleash. People also usually don't fight for a leader - Ukrainians don't fight \"for Zelenskyy\" - but for their homes, way of life, and a better future. Ukrainian civil society powerfully demonstrated this in the recent protests against the controversial attempt at eliminating political independence of Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies. Personally, as a Finn, I have much more faith in my fellow countrywomen and —men than the political leadership. That does not mean, however, that leadership doesn't matter. Good and inspirational leadership helps people reach their full potential and go beyond it. We should dare to be more imaginative, as it can also widen the scope of what is politically possible.Thanks for reading Phillips's Newsletter! This post is public so feel free to share it.Share",

Geetanjali says:   I’ve often been laughed at for using mosquito nets, but for me they’re a fantastic alternative to using chemical repellents and pesticides during the mosquito season.

Send this thing to the Smithsonian, put it on loop in an exhibition hall next to the Ghiblified Twitter avatars and the AI-generated witness testimony that led a judge to hand down a harsher sentence. To back up: Acosta, CNN's former White House correspondent and Trump irritant, who's recently launched a Substack and YouTube show, aired a segment in which he questions an AI-generated simulacrum of Joaquin Oliver, one of the teenagers killed in the 2018 Parkland high school massacre. So on the occasion of Joaquin's would-be 25th birthday, Acosta asked his chatbot reproduction about gun violence, Star Wars, and how it would address the mass shooting epidemic.It's not just that \"former broadcaster interviews an AI-generated school shooting victim\" is a construct bleaker than any cyberpunk story beat I can think of offhand, it's how many trend lines towards decline had to intersect to have made this particular event possible. Critics have piled on, and not just because it's another callous 'reanimate the dead with subpar AI' stunt. There's a lot packed into the hull of this one, and it's so much more tragedy than farce.Brief obligatory note that Blood in the Machine is a 100% reader-supported publication. Subscribe below.

Thanks all, and onwards.Subscribe nowFirst, who knows if we ever would have seen this at all if Acosta hadn't gotten demoted and left CNN. Speculation abounds, but the network was reportedly planning on moving him to a midnight time slot, in a move some saw as a gesture of appeasement to Trump. If Acosta was still at CNN, the network might have balked at airing something like this for legal, ethical, or simple commercial reasons. There is certainly a media criticism story here, about how the battered standards of professional journalism are making room for dubious stuff like this. As for the AI itself, it's, let's say, very bad. AI-generated Joaquin's movements are stilted and crude, its voice well out of sync. That voice is monotone one minute and lurching into a pitch shift the next, delivering canned lines in a sentence structure anyone who's used a chatbot for a few minutes will recognize. It's an animatronic and poorly photoshopped ghost, and the effect might be comic if it weren't brought into being by such profound tragedy.You have to sympathize with the parents. They've endured a devastation I almost called unimaginable but has become imaginable to too many parents who've lost children this way. The Olivers have been stalwart campaigners for gun reform, and they created the AI avatar of their son out of a desire, they say, to continue to raise Joaquin's voice. They want to bring his AI-generated avatar onstage to policy debates, to start social media accounts for him, to make him unignorable, and also so they can continue to relate to their lost son. It's all so unspeakably sad. Critics of Acosta's AI interview have called this \"grotesque\" and so forth but it's easy enough to understand the desire. An American politics in thrall to the gun lobby and warrior capitalism has proved incapable of confronting the epidemic of mass death, and no matter how many children are gunned down, grieving parents form political advocacy groups to seek reform, or former mass shooting survivors attempt to enter politics only to see the establishment eject them, nothing at all changes. To these grieving parents, maybe this AI offers at least a gesture towards a horizon where some kind of change, anything at all, is possible. Even if that promise is illusory, and the bot quite technically incapable of offering any new insights, trained as it is on corpuses of data drawn from the same gun wracked past. It is some kind of motion, forward or not.Who knows whether the parents, after fighting seven years for common sense gun reforms and getting nowhere, even realistically think this AI will make a difference. But it's something, even if it's a numb, disconcerting shrug of a something. Come to think of it, while we're wallowing in the bleakness here, a numb, disconcerting shrug of a something is a serviceable descriptor for the appeal of AI as a vehicle for social improvement.When tech industry lights say \"AI will solve climate change\" or \"AI will cure cancer,\" prospects that also only sound feasible or even aspirational in the cold light of broad institutional failure, does anyone believe them anymore? Does anyone take that pitch at all seriously? More likely they are giving off a numb disconcerting shrug, because though AI might not even be a credible panacea, at least it's enough to generate the illusion that progress is possible. For plenty of investors, that's probably good enough. Most of the rest of us, I think, intuit that the automated ghosts of mass shooting victims won't offer any durable insights that might help us get out of these messes.

      "content": "While his administration seems to have opened new fronts in every political conflict and culture war in our society, there's little question that immigration is the focal point of the Donald Trump 2.0 agenda. Obstructing immigration (both legal and not) has proven to be the clearest line connecting his rhetoric to his action, and consequently the issue where he has the most obvious mandate; if he ran on anything, it was immigration restriction, and as much as I hate to say it a man who won the popular vote and every swing state enjoys public backing for his signature issue. Not coincidentally, immigration policy is also the area where the consequences of Democratic failure are most stark. Despite years of knowing that this was coming, this anti-immigrant backlash as wedge issue for a supremely nativist candidate, despite all the warnings, despite polling, press coverage, internal memos, and reality screaming in their faces, the Democratic Party was powerless to neutralize Trump's immigration rhetoric - because the party still does not have an immigration policy.To be clear, they do have slogans. They have talking points. They have hashtags and symbolic gestures and sternly worded denunciations. But they do not have a plan, not one that anyone can point to, explain, or run on. After a first term defined as much by incompetence and instability as by its accomplishments, second-term Trump quickly rounded into form with ICE raids, mass deportation, and a grim machinery of border enforcement both far more expansive and more effective than that of his first term. And what's the response from the opposition party? The accurate contention that this was all inhumane, and probably economically ruinous, and certainly not in keeping with America's immigrant past, but not much else. Policy specifics - who we should be letting in, how many of them, via what mechanism, with what form of enforcement or oversight - have been and remain very scarce.This isn't just a tactical blunder. It's not merely a matter of bad strategy or poor messaging. It's the culmination of a deeper rot among the Democrats, a party that has ceased to be a party of governance and become, instead, a kind of anti-party: a coalition of elites whose only unifying impulse is opposition to the right. They run on vibes, outrage, and cultural identification. They organize around preventing Republicans from doing things, sure, but it frequently seems that they no longer bother with the hard work of articulating what they themselves would do instead. The same old war over neoliberalism is raging in the party, this time with the new euphemism \"abundance,\" but the party has avoided directly confronting that debate for years, still stung by the Clinton-Sanders war. In more concrete terms, the question of economic populism and cultural issues continues to haunt Democrats, whether it's an organic conflict or not, and there too, they punt. With Trump as an all-encompassing target to rally against - and, crucially, to fundraise around - it's just too easy for the party to be only what it is not, for it to play into precisely its modern reputation for incoherence. On immigration more than anywhere else, that vacuum has become undeniable. Read more",

But their actions speak louder than words. Most of them give up music-making forever after a short exposure to lessons.The Honest Broker is a reader-supported guide to music, books, media & culture. Both free and paid subscriptions are available. If you want to support my work, the best way is by taking out a paid subscription.Subscribe nowThese figures are from the UK, but I suspect the trend is similar elsewhere:People who \"no longer play\" music is the fastest growing demographic (Source: ABRSM)If music is so much fun, why are music lessons so painful?I've often pointed out that only three careers turn work into play. Even our choice of words reveals that. An athlete plays a sport. An actor plays a role. And a musician plays an instrument.Everybody else goes to work. Anyone who has the privilege to pursue one of those three careers is truly blessed. You can complain as much as you want, but the rest of us see that your job is just play.The reason most people abandon music lessons isn't cost or time—they just don't want to keep doing it. It doesn't feel like play to them. Source: ABRSMThe shift from elementary school to high school is the typical time when youngsters abandon music. This is puzzling for many reasons. For example, I found that I only started gaining social esteem and other benefits from my music-making around the time I turned sixteen. And that's when most teens stop learning music.I hadn't expected that all those hours at the piano would give me a popularity boost—that wasn't why I studied music. And it surprised me when I started experiencing it, but I certainly didn't complain. Maybe playing the piano wasn't quite as cool as being captain of the football team, but it turned out to be pretty cool nonetheless, especially if you knew how to play some of the hit songs on the radio.The funny thing is that I'd experienced piano lesson burnout—but that happened back when I was nine years old. I hated my piano lessons, and asked my parents if I could stop taking them. They agreed, and so my musical education came to a grinding halt after 4th grade.But here's the interesting thing. I continued to play the piano after I stopped taking lessons—but now I did it for fun. I made up my own songs. I learned other songs I liked by ear. I actually played the instrument more after those awful lessons had been terminated.Years later, I took a few more lessons—I had a teacher for several months around the time I was thirteen, but now it was my decision, not my parents. I also took lessons from other teachers during my senior year in high school and the first term of my freshman year in college. And that is the sum total of my formal music education at the piano.Finally, when I started playing jazz professionally in my twenties, I wondered whether I should find a real jazz teacher. But by that time, I was fairly advanced in my playing, and needed a real hotshot professional to guide me, and there were only around a half dozen pianists in Northern California I really trusted in that regard. I made an unsuccessful attempt to enlist the late Jessica Williams as a teacher. But it didn't work out—because... well, let's say she made some unusual demands.So I developed without jazz teachers, both as a musician and as a music historian. There's some irony in that. I had access to amazing professors at illustrious universities, but jazz wasn't part of the curriculum. In the field in which I made my reputation, I had to teach myself.I'm not especially proud of that. Too much of what I've done in life has happened outside official channels. I've missed things by not accessing the right teachers at the right time. Things I did learn, I might have learned faster with proper guidance.On the other hand, you learn very deeply when forced to invent your own pedagogy. And I take some comfort in knowing that there were almost no jazz teachers for the generations that came before me. Many of the jazz pioneers learned by doing—and they turned out okay.In any event, my particular life story makes me a good judge of why youngsters stop studying music—and also of what circumstances might allow them to continue in a satisfying way.So here are my observations on why children hate music lessons. In part two of this article, I will explain how I'd change things if I were a music educator.(1) The first problem is that they're called lessons. Music-making is fun, but music lessons are something very different. The first change I'd make is eliminating the word lesson from my vocabulary. I'd get rid of the word practicing too. And fortunately we already have a better word—it's called playing. You play your instrument, and the experience is one of fun and playfulness.(2) Music carries the heavy baggage of the entire education bureaucracy, and this makes everything boring and burdensome. As Paul Graham has rightly pointed out, the single biggest impact of early education is to convince students that hard work is pointless and should be avoided at all costs. Too much of homework and testing is designed solely for the purpose of convincing a teacher of your competency. The idea that you might work hard for your own benefit is never taught in school, and many people never realize that important fact. Music lessons suffer because they rely on similar metrics, and are often integrated into our bureaucratic educational system. So even something intrinsically fun (like music-making) starts to feel burdensome. (3) Parents are part of the problem—maybe the biggest part. Suzuki, the great music education innovator, realized this early on. He found that parents imposed all sorts of negative attitudes on to their children. They yelled at them to practice more. They sat in judgment at recitals. They had vague ambitions about how their children's performances would enhance their own status. Etc. In fact, the history of music lessons shows that this has always been the case—the rise of piano ownership has always been associated with class aspirations. And the most frequent reason these lessons got embraced by families during the 18th and 19th centuries was to improve the marriage prospects of their children. Things have changed a little since then, but we still have non-musical motivations for imposing these lessons on youngsters. These only increase the drudgery of formal music education.(4) The endless round of recitals, auditions, and competitions create a perfection-driven culture that diminishes—and often kills—the sheer joy of music-making. Ethnomusicologists have studied many societies where everybody participates joyously in music-making—but that only happens when you don't have auditions and competitions to weed out poor performers. If the goal is to enhance your inner joy and satisfaction, you would do things very differently.When my youngest son was a teenager, he was fortunate enough to play in a school orchestra that frequently won the state competition. But, as it turned out, this wasn't as fortunate as it seemed. I feared that the unrelenting focus on competition would destroy his love of music. I saw it happening. He was advancing in proficiency, but losing his joy in the process. So when he discussed quitting orchestra, I not only supported that decision but encouraged it—in the face of all the experts who told us this was a mistake.(In the follow-up article, I will tell you what he did instead—today we're dealing with problems, not solutions—but the end result is that today he is an excellent musician who enjoys every aspect of his craft.)(5) The ultra-intense hype on music lessons as building blocks of high educational achievement just aggravates the situation. Sure, I believe all the hype about the links between music-making and improved academic performance. Music probably does activate and nurture the same part of the brain you use for math and science. You probably do get better grades if you're a focused, dedicated musician. But this kind of attitude treats the music itself as a negligible byproduct, instead of celebrating the intrinsic joy of music-making. If you learn music for this reason, you will never get the greatest benefits from it, which can't be reduced to a GPA or SAT metric.(6) The Western classical music tradition is amazing, and I cherish it every day of my life, but an educational system that just focuses exclusively on scrupulously playing note-for-note compositions written by people who died long ago is a mistake. If you want to convince people that music is stagnant, you couldn't find a better method. Let's keep Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, and all the rest—I love them dearly; but let's also embed them into a larger practice that is alive and vibrant. Those are the problems. And they're big ones. In my follow-up article, I'll suggest ways of dealing with them. But be forewarned: My approach to music education will be radically different from the status quo.",

      "content": "I come with unfortunate news: in my investigations, I have stumbled on a completely decisive proof of atheism. I know, me even saying this is proof enough to convince you, but you should at least read the argument since it's a good maxim to think for yourself. Take some time to emotionally adjust, and then proceed. Everyone learns in grade school that it's possible for things with probability 0 to happen. If I flip a coin infinitely many times, it could happen that I get a heads every time. But the probability of that is less than or equal to the first n tosses all being heads, the probability of which is 1/2n. So the probability of getting all heads is less than or equal to 1/2n for any n, so the probability is 0, known for being the only number in [0, 1] less than or equal to all 1/2n. You may reply: \"Well, it seems too crazy to accept that something with probability 0 can happen. So I'll just say it's impossible for each of the infinity tosses to land heads.\" That won't work, Joe. Whatever the sequence of flips actually ends up being—whichever random but even distribution of heads and tails comes up—there is likewise a probability of zero that that particular sequence would be the one that comes up, for exactly the same reason: the probability that the flips match a given sequence for the first n tosses is 1/2n, etc. So, things with probability 0 can happen. Now, consider the following scenario.1 A man, Bob, has just finished an infinite sequence of independent and fair coin flips (he started a very long time ago). After surveying his results, he tells you a shocking fact: only finitely many of the flips landed tails. Now, he asks you what the probability is that the 100th most recent coin flip laded tails (EDIT—look at this footnote2). Easy question, right? There are infinity heads, but only N tails, and you have no evidence as to where the tails-flips occurred, so it seems like the probability that one of the N tails was on the 100th-most-recent flip is equal to N/infinity = 0. Or, if the preceding reasoning doesn't pan out, at least it is very slim. Okay. Now imagine an alternative scenario. Again, Bob just finished his infinity coin flips. Except this time, he wasn't paying attention during the 100th most recent flip, and he forgot to write it down. Anyway, he tells you that of the coin flips he was paying attention during (that is, all of them except the 100th most recent), only finitely many of them were tails. Now, what's the probability that the 100th coin flip was tails? Well, that's just an independent coin flip; it's the same as if you just flipped a coin now, except it just happened to be the 100th in this series. Bob didn't take note of the result, so nothing he tells you has any correlation to what happened on the 100th flip, so it's just a fair coin toss whose result you don't know. It seems clear that the probability that flip landed tails is 0.5. Let F denote the proposition that only finitely many tosses landed tails, F' the proposition that only finitely many of the tosses other than the 100th landed tails, and let H be the proposition that the 100th landed tails. Then, summarizing, we have: But wait a minute: F and F' are the same outcomes. No matter what happened on the 100th flip, that can't change whether only finitely many flips were tails. If infinitely many flips other than the 100th are tails, then the number of tails is infinite either way; if only finitely many other than the 100th are tails, then even the 100th being tails won't push the finite number to infinity. Therefore, we should have P(F) = P(F'). How do we get out of this paradox? Maybe we should say that P(H | F') is not equal to 0.5. But that seems implausible. The 100th coin flip is just a coin flip, and its inclusion in the sequence is arbitrary. If you say it doesn't have a 0.5 chance of tails, you'd have to say that about every possible coin flip. Say you'll flip a coin tomorrow. We can then consider that to be the 0th flip in the sequence. Based on Bob's testimony, you now know that only finitely many of the total amount of flips—whether his flips, or yours tomorrow—will be finite. Do you then conclude the 0th flip is probably going to land heads? Of course not, you're just flipping a coin tomorrow, the probability of tails is 0.5. Should we instead say that P(H | F) = 0.5? I don't think so. If you thought the chance that the 100th toss was tails was 0.5 (in the case where Bob looked at the whole sequence), you'd have to say that about every particular toss. What's more, you'd have to say that, for any finite collection of n C and any sequence s of length n, the probability that the flips in C were in accordance with the sequence s is 1/2n. For example, the probability that the 10th, 100th, and 1234th flips were H, T, and T, respectively is 1 in 8. (To see why this is, just run the second case, except where Bob failed to note those three results. No finite collection of tosses can make a difference as to whether only finitely many were tails). However, we then run into problems. Let's create a natural number m whose binary digits come from the results of the flips, with tails being 1 and heads being 0. So, for example, if Bob's result was H, T, H, T, T, H, H, and then infinitely many Hs, then m is (going backwards) 110102 = 26. Because there will only be finitely many 1s, we are guaranteed to have a well-defined m. Here's the problem: given that there are only finitely many tails, each possible value of m is equally likely. Say that a and b are both fewer than n digits long. If there is a 1 past the nth digit, then neither a nor b are the value of m. If there is not a 1 past the nth digit, then the probability that m matches a (including the leading 0s) is 1/2n, and similar for b. The probability is the same in both cases, so P(m = a) = P(m = b). This reasoning holds for all possible values of m. So, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, each value equally likely. But this is impossible, for there is no uniform distribution on a countable set. Maybe the two probabilities in question—P(H | F) and P(H | F')—are not well-defined? Fat chance. P(H | F') is definitely equal to 0.5, as explained above. And if it's defined, so is P(H | F), since F = F'. The actual solution to this paradox is the same reason why this paradox will literally never affect us in our lives: the scenario is impossible. Bob can't flip a coin infinity times, and if he did, he wouldn't be able to be sensitive to the whole history of the sequence so as to tell you there were only finitely many tails. I would admit it's possible for things with probability 0 to happen—nothing rules out the possibility that something like infinitely many independent coin flips could occur in some world, and whatever the particular sequence that obtains is, that sequence has probability 0. But we could never learn that something with probability 0 happened, since that would require getting infinite information, which nobody can do. Our eyes, ears, etc. can only take in a finite amount of information. Even if a dart strikes an infinitely precise dart board, we could never measure it with infinite precision, so as to learn which probability-zero event happened. But if the paradox can only be solved by supposing agents can't learn that probability-zero events happen, then omniscience is impossible, for God could never know what probability-zero events have obtained. And certainly it should still be possible for such events to obtain, since if God cannot do infinite coin flips, then he is not omnipotent. If you think infinite time is impossible, then God could do the infinite flips as a supertask: he'll take 0.5 seconds to do the first flip, 0.25 to do the second, 0.125 to do the third, etc.3 If there is some nonzero amount of time such that God cannot flip a coin that fast, then again, he is not omnipotent. You may reply that the paradox only arises if someone learns there were finitely many tails without learning which particular flips were tails. But, you say, God already knows all the results, since he is omniscient. This doesn't fix the problem: even if God knows everything, he could still tell an angel that there were only finitely many tails, and then the paradox would arise for that angel. If God cannot tell an angel such a thing, then he is not omnipotent. If you reply, \"perhaps the angel isn't certain that they're really being told by God that there were finitely many tails,\" you must still admit that the agent assigns nonzero probability to God having told the truth and them having understood God correctly and such, and so they assign nonzero probability to F = \"there are only finitely many heads,\" and the paradox re-arises with respect to the conditional probability distribution P(— | F). Therefore, God does not exist. (EDIT—I'm beginning to worry some of you actually think I think this is a good argument against the existence of God. Please, live a little.)(EDIT 2—A real, fatal flaw in my reasoning was identified by Plasma Bloggin'. In retrospect, the error is a rather silly one. Identifying this, I think, leads to a satisfying solution to the puzzle, even granting that the weird cases with zero probabilities can happen. See if you can find it before looking at his comment.)Moral Law Within is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.1I got this case from Daniel Rubio, though I only just now realized it proves that God doesn't exist. 2What I have in mind here is that Bob has been flipping for infinitely long, and has now come to a stop. So maybe he flipped a coin a second ago, and one two seconds ago, etc. I'll refer to the last flip as the \"first,\" the second-last as the \"second,\" etc. But the order of the infinite series shouldn't matter.3If you don't like infinite coin flips, we can replace the example with God picking a random number between 0 and 1, and treating each 0 in the binary expansion as a heads and each 1 as a tails.",

      "content": "photo cred: my dadLook, I don't know if AI is gonna kill us or make us all rich or whatever, but I do know we've got the wrong metaphor.We want to understand these things as people. When you type a question to ChatGPT and it types back the answer in complete sentences, it feels like there must be a little guy in there doing the typing. We get this vivid sense of \"it's alive!!\", and we activate all of the mental faculties we evolved to deal with fellow humans: theory of mind, attribution, impression management, stereotyping, cheater detection, etc.We can't help it; humans are hopeless anthropomorphizers. When it comes to perceiving personhood, we're so trigger-happy that we can see the Virgin Mary in a grilled cheese sandwich:A human face in a slice of nematode:credit: Massimo BrizziAnd an old man in a bunch of poultry and fish atop a pile of books:Giuseppe Arcimboldo, The Jurist (1566)Apparently, this served us well in our evolutionary history—maybe it's so important not to mistake people for things that we err on the side of mistaking things for people.1 This is probably why we're so willing to explain strange occurrences by appealing to fantastical creatures with minds and intentions: everybody in town is getting sick because of WITCHES, you can't see the sun right now because A WOLF ATE IT, the volcano erupted because GOD IS MAD. People who experience sleep paralysis sometimes hallucinate a demon-like creature sitting on their chest, and one explanation is that the subconscious mind is trying to understand why the body can't move, and instead of coming up with \"I'm still in REM sleep so there's not enough acetylcholine in my brain to activate my primary motor cortex\", it comes up with \"BIG DEMON ON TOP OF ME\".Henry Fuseli, The Nightmare (1781). Credit: Tulip HysteriaThis is why the past three years have been so confusing—the little guy inside the AI keeps dumbfounding us by doing things that a human wouldn't do. Why does he make up citations when he does my social studies homework? How come he can beat me at Go but he can't tell me how many \"r\"s are in the word \"strawberry\"? Why is he telling me to put glue on my pizza?2Trying to understand LLMs by using the rules of human psychology is like trying to understand a game of Scrabble by using the rules of Pictionary. These things don't act like people because they aren't people. I don't mean that in the deflationary way that the AI naysayers mean it. They think denying humanity to the machines is a well-deserved insult; I think it's just an accurate description.3 As long we try to apply our person perception to artificial intelligence, we'll keep being surprised and befuddled.We are in dire need of a better metaphor. Here's my suggestion: instead of seeing AI as a sort of silicon homunculus, we should see it as a bag of words.WHAT'S IN THE BAGAn AI is a bag that contains basically all words ever written, at least the ones that could be scraped off the internet or scanned out of a book. When users send words into the bag, it sends back the most relevant words it has. There are so many words in the bag that the most relevant ones are often correct and helpful, and AI companies secretly add invisible words to your queries to make this even more likely.This is an oversimplification, of course. But it's also surprisingly handy. For example, AIs will routinely give you outright lies or hallucinations, and when you're like \"Uhh hey that was a lie\", they will immediately respond \"Oh my god I'm SO SORRY!! I promise I'll never ever do that again!! I'm turning over a new leaf right now, nothing but true statements from here on\" and then they will literally lie to you in the next sentence. This would be baffling and exasperating behavior coming from a human, but it's very normal behavior coming from a bag of words. If you toss a question into the bag and the right answer happens to be in there, that's probably what you'll get. If it's not in there, you'll get some related-but-inaccurate bolus of sentences. When you accuse it of lying, it's going to produce lots of words from the \"I've been accused of lying\" part of the bag. Calling this behavior \"malicious\" or \"erratic\" is misleading because it's not behavior at all, just like it's not \"behavior\" when a calculator multiplies numbers for you.\"Bag of words\" is a also a useful heuristic for predicting where an AI will do well and where it will fail. \"Give me a list of the ten worst transportation disasters in North America\" is an easy task for a bag of words, because disasters are well-documented. On the other hand, \"Who reassigned the species Brachiosaurus brancai to its own genus, and when?\" is a hard task for a bag of words, because the bag just doesn't contain that many words on the topic.4 And a question like \"What are the most important lessons for life?\" won't give you anything outright false, but it will give you a bunch of fake-deep pablum, because most of the text humans have produced on that topic is, no offense, fake-deep pablum.When you forget that an AI is just a big bag of words, you can easily slip into acting like it's an all-seeing glob of pure intelligence. For example, I was hanging with a group recently where one guy made everybody watch a video of some close-up magic, and after the magician made some coins disappear, he exclaimed, \"I asked ChatGPT how this trick works, and even it didn't know!\" as if this somehow made the magic extra magical. In this person's model of the world, we are all like shtetl-dwelling peasants and AI is like our Rabbi Hillel, the only learned man for 100 miles. If Hillel can't understand it, then it must be truly profound!If that guy had instead seen ChatGPT as a bag of words, he would have realized that the bag probably doesn't contain lots of detailed descriptions of contemporary coin tricks. After all, magicians make money from performing and selling their tricks, not writing about them at length on the internet. Plus, magic tricks are hard to describe—\"He had three quarters in his hand and then it was two pennies!\"—so you're going to have a hard time prompting the right words out of the bag. The coin trick is not literally magic, and neither is the bag of words.GALILEO GPTThe \"bag of words\" metaphor can also help us guess what these things are gonna do next. If you want to know whether AI will get better at something in the future, just ask: \"can you fill the bag with it?\" For instance, people are kicking around the idea that AI will replace human scientists. Well, if you want your bag of words to do science for you, you need to stuff it with lots of science. Can we do that?When it comes to specific scientific tasks, yes, we already can. If you fill the bag with data from 170,000 proteins, for example, it'll do a pretty good job predicting how proteins will fold. Fill the bag with chemical reactions and it can tell you how to synthesize new molecules. Fill the bag with journal articles and then describe an experiment and it can tell you whether anyone has already scooped you.All of that is cool, and I expect more of it in the future. I don't think we're far from a bag of words being able to do an entire low-quality research project from beginning to end—coming up with a hypothesis, designing the study, running it, analyzing the results, writing them up, making the graphs, arranging it all on a poster, all at the click of a button—because we've got loads of low-quality science to put in the bag. If you walk up and down the poster sessions at a psychology conference, you can see lots of first-year PhD students presenting studies where they seemingly pick some semi-related constructs at random, correlate them, and print out a p-value (\"Does self-efficacy moderate the relationship between social dominance orientation and system-justifying beliefs?\"). A bag of words can basically do this already; you just need to give it access to an online participant pool and a big printer.5But science is a strong-link problem; if we produced a million times more crappy science, we'd be right where we are now. If we want more of the good stuff, what should we put in the bag? You could stuff the bag with papers, but some of them are fraudulent, some are merely mistaken, and all of them contain unstated assumptions that could turn out to be false. And they're usually missing key information—they don't share the data, or they don't describe their methods in adequate detail. Markus Strasser, an entrepreneur who tried to start one of those companies that's like \"we'll put every scientific paper in the bag and then ??? and then profit\", eventually abandoned the effort, saying that \"close to nothing of what makes science actually work is published as text on the web.\"6Here's one way to think about it: if there had been enough text to train an LLM in 1600, would it have scooped Galileo? My guess is no. Ask that early modern ChatGPT whether the Earth moves and it will helpfully tell you that experts have considered the possibility and ruled it out. And that's by design. If it had started claiming that our planet is zooming through space at 67,000mph, its dutiful human trainers would have punished it: \"Bad computer!! Stop hallucinating!!\"In fact, an early 1600s bag of words wouldn't just have the right words in the wrong order. At the time, the right words didn't exist. As the historian of science David Wootton points out7, when Galileo was trying to describe his discovery of the moons of Jupiter, none of the languages he knew had a good word for \"discover\". He had to use awkward circumlocutions like \"I saw something unknown to all previous astronomers before me\". The concept of learning new truths by looking through a glass tube would have been totally foreign to an LLM of the early 1600s, as it was to most of the people of the early 1600s, with a few notable exceptions.You would get better scientific descriptions from a 2025 bag of words than you would from a 1600 bag of words. But both bags might be equally bad at producing the scientific ideas of their respective futures. Scientific breakthroughs often require doing things that are irrational and unreasonable for the standards of the time and good ideas usually look stupid when they first arrive, so they are often—with good reason!—rejected, dismissed, and ignored. This is a big problem for a bag of words that contains all of yesterday's good ideas. Putting new ideas in the bag will often make the bag worse, on average, because most of those new ideas will be wrong. That's why revolutionary research requires not only intelligence, but also stupidity. I expect humans to remain usefully stupider than bags of words for the foreseeable future.Subscribe nowCLAUDE WILL U GO TO PROM WITH ME?The most important part of the \"bag of words\" metaphor is that it prevents us from thinking about AI in terms of social status. Our ancestors had to play status games well enough to survive and reproduce—losers, by and large, don't get to pass on their genes. This has left our species exquisitely attuned to who's up and who's down. Accordingly, we can turn anything into a competition: cheese rolling, nettle eating, phone throwing, toe wrestling, and ferret legging, where male contestants, sans underwear, put live ferrets in their pants for as long as they can. (The world record is five hours and thirty minutes.)When we personify AI, we mistakenly make it a competitor in our status games. That's why we've been arguing about artificial intelligence like it's a new kid in school: is she cool? Is she smart? Does she have a crush on me? The better AIs have gotten, the more status-anxious we've become. If these things are like people, then we gotta know: are we better or worse than them? Will they be our masters, our rivals, or our slaves? Is their art finer, their short stories tighter, their insights sharper than ours? If so, there's only one logical end: ultimately, we must either kill them or worship them.But a bag of words is not a spouse, a sage, a sovereign, or a serf. It's a tool. Its purpose is to automate our drudgeries and amplify our abilities. Its social status is NA; it makes no sense to ask whether it's \"better\" than us. The real question is: does using it make us better?That's why I'm not afraid of being rendered obsolete by a bag of words. Machines have already matched or surpassed humans on all sorts of tasks. A pitching machine can throw a ball faster than a human can, spellcheck gets the letters right every time, and autotune never sings off key. But we don't go to baseball games, spelling bees, and Taylor Swift concerts for the speed of the balls, the accuracy of the spelling, or the pureness of the pitch. We go because we care about humans doing those things. It wouldn't be interesting to watch a bag of words do them—unless we mistakenly start treating that bag like it's a person.(That's also why I see no point in using AI to, say, write an essay, just like I see no point in bringing a forklift to the gym. Sure, it can lift the weights, but I'm not trying to suspend a barbell above the floor for the hell of it. I lift it because I want to become the kind of person who can lift it. Similarly, I write because I want to become the kind of person who can think.)But that doesn't mean I'm unafraid of AI entirely. I'm plenty afraid! Any tool can be dangerous when used the wrong way—nail guns and nuclear reactors can kill people just fine without having a mind inside them. In fact, the \"bag of words\" metaphor makes it clear that AI can be dangerous precisely because it doesn't operate like humans do. The dangers we face from humans are scary but familiar: hotheaded humans might kick you in the head, reckless humans might drink and drive, duplicitous humans might pretend to be your friend so they can steal your identity. We can guard against these humans because we know how they operate. But we don't know what's gonna come out of the bag of words. For instance, if you show humans computer code that has security vulnerabilities, they do not suddenly start praising Hitler. But LLMs do.8 So yes, I would worry about putting the nuclear codes in the bag.9C'MON BERTIEAnyone who has owned an old car has been tempted to interpret its various malfunctions as part of its temperament. When it won't start on a cold day, it feels like the appropriate response is to plead, the same way you would with a sleepy toddler or a tardy partner: \"C'mon Bertie, we gotta get to the dentist!\" But ultimately, person perception is a poor guide to vehicle maintenance. Cars are made out of metal and plastic that turn gasoline into forward motion; they are not made out of bones and meat that turn Twinkies into thinking. If you want to fix a broken car, you need a wrench, a screwdriver, and a blueprint, not a cognitive-behavioral therapy manual.Similarly, anyone who sees a mind inside the bag of words has fallen for a trick. They've had their evolution exploited. Their social faculties are firing not because there's a human in front of them, but because natural selection gave those faculties a hair trigger. For all of human history, something that talked like a human and walked like a human was, in fact, a human. Soon enough, something that talks and walks like a human may, in fact, be a very sophisticated logistic regression. If we allow ourselves to be seduced by the superficial similarity, we'll end up like the moths who evolved to navigate by the light of the moon, only to find themselves drawn to—and ultimately electrocuted by—the mysterious glow of a bug zapper.Unlike moths, however, we aren't stuck using the instincts that natural selection gave us. We can choose the schemas we use to think about technology. We've done it before: we don't refer to a backhoe as an \"artificial digging guy\" or a crane as an \"artificial tall guy\". We don't think of books as an \"artificial version of someone talking to you\", photographs as \"artificial visual memories\", or listening to recorded sound as \"attending an artificial recital\". When pocket calculators debuted, they were already smarter than every human on Earth, at least when it comes to calculation—a job that itself used to be done by humans. Folks wondered whether this new technology was \"a tool or a toy\", but nobody seems to have wondered whether it was a person.(If you covered a backhoe with skin, made its bucket look like a hand, painted eyes on its chassis, and made it play a sound like \"hnngghhh!\" whenever it lifted something heavy, then we'd start wondering whether there's a ghost inside the machine. That wouldn't tell us anything about backhoes, but it would tell us a lot about our own psychology.)The original sin of artificial intelligence was, of course, calling it artificial intelligence. Those two words have lured us into making man the measure of machine: \"Now it's as smart as an undergraduate...now it's as smart as a PhD!\" These comparisons only give us the illusion of understanding AI's capabilities and limitations, as well as our own, because we don't actually know what it means to be smart in the first place. Our definitions of intelligence are either wrong (\"Intelligence is the ability to solve problems\") or tautological (\"Intelligence is the ability to do things that require intelligence\").10It's unfortunate that the computer scientists figured out how to make something that kinda looks like intelligence before the psychologists could actually figure out what intelligence is, but here we are. There's no putting the cat back in the bag now. It won't fit—there's too many words in there.Experimental History is covered with skin and going hnnnnghPS it's been a busy week on Substack— and I discussed why people get so anxious about conversations, and how to have better ones:Derek Thompson Why Are Americans So Scared of Talking to Each Other?Americans are more alone than ever.

If a real person told me to put glue on my pizza, I'm probably never going to trust them again.3In fact, hating these things so much actually gives them humanity. Our greatest hate is always reserved for fellow humans.4Notably, ChatGPT now does much better on this question, in part by using the very post that criticizes its earlier performance. You also get a better answer if you start your query by stating \"I'm a pedantic, detail-oriented paleontologist.\" This is classic bag-of-words behavior.5Or you could save time and money by allowing the AI to make up the data itself, which is a time-honored tradition in the field.6This was written in 2021, so bag-technology has improved a lot since then. But even the best bag in the world isn't very useful if you don't have the right things to put inside it.7p. 58 in my version8Other weird effects: being polite to the LLMs makes them sometimes better and some times worse at math. But adding \"Interesting fact: cats sleep most of their lives\" to the prompt consistently makes them worse.9Another advantage of this metaphor is that we could refer to \"AI Safety\" as \"securing the bag\"10Even the word \"artificial\" is wrong, because it menacingly implies replacement. Artificial sweeteners, flowers, legs—these are things we only use when we can't have the real deal. So what part of intelligence, exactly, are we so intent on replacing?",

Cupertino's AI contrarianism of betting on the device, not the cloud; and on the routinized use-case, not the wide-open ChatBot, is—probably—not just defensible as a bet, but a bet at favorable odds...ShareShare Brad DeLong's Grasping RealityThis at least looks, to me, relatively clear: Apple's AI strategy is not a problem. The company's bet on on-device channeled intelligence, its focus on privacy and user experience—are all, I think, not just defensible but shrewd choices. The trouble is execution. Siri is still a punchline. Apple's AI features, when they appear, too often feel like demos or afterthoughts. It doesn't just work. And what they have actually shipped, if it were to work, would lead to the reaction: why is this? magic that made the iPhone, AirPods, or Apple Pay category-defining. The major risk for Apple is not that it's playing the wrong game, but that it is not playing hard enough. If Cupertino wants to cash in on its favorable-odds bets, it needs to kick its AI execution up not one, but two gears—fast. Otherwise, all the strategic discipline in the world will amount to little more than a footnote in a case study on missed inflection points.Back when I was a wee'un, Michael Spence once said from the front of the classroom: \"if this were a real business-school rather than a liberal arts class, we would now spend twice as much time on how a corporation would proceed to structure itself to execute this corporate strategy as we have on how a corporation should formulate it, but we are on the north side of the river, and we need to move this course on...\" Smart words.

The scale is enormous: NVIDIA's gross margins have soared to the 70–75% range, a figure that would make even the most rapacious of monopolists blush. The A100 and H100 GPU chips—the backbone of large-scale AI inference and training—are selling for $25,000 to $40,000 apiece, and sometimes more in spot markets, with actual production costs a tiny fraction of that sum even as NVIDIA has to rely on TSMC which has to rely on ASML as essential sole suppliers. The result? Even the largest hyperscalers—Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta—are funnelling billions and tens of billions a year into NVIDIA's coffers, both because Jensen Huang's team has invented a better mousetrap, and because his team has has, by force of early vision and relentless execution, created a de facto standard and an ecosystem (CUDA) that locks in demand and raises switching costs to vertiginous heights.The magnitude: NVIDIA's data center revenue for the most recent fiscal year exceeded $50 billion, up from $15 billion just two years prior—a threefold increase, almost entirely attributable to AI demand. It is not as though TSMC has tripled its fab throughout at actually making NVIDIA's chips, after all. The company's market capitalization now rivals that of the oil majors at the peak of their powers. For every dollar spent on cloud AI compute, a substantial slice—estimates range from 20% to 40%—is captured as economic rent by NVIDIA, rather than being competed away or reinvested in broader innovation. Why? Because Google, Microsoft, and Meta believe they must burn tens of billions a year on cloud-based AI.Refer a friendApple, by contrast, has—so far—largely avoided this tax. By designing its own silicon (the M-series chips) and focusing on on-device inference, Apple sidesteps the need to rent vast fleets of NVIDIA-powered servers for AI workloads. Instead, it invests in its own private cloud infrastructure, powered by Apple Silicon, and keeps its capital expenditures at a fraction of the scale now required of its peers. This is not a detail. It is instead a huge bet that the locus of value in AI will, for its customers, remain at the on-device edge—not in the cloud.The broader implication is clear: as long as the AI gold rush continues, and as long as CUDA remains the lingua franca of machine learning, NVIDIA's pricing power will persist, and the tax will be levied on all who lack the will or the capability to defect. Apple's escape from this regime is, I think, both remarkable and fragile. Should the center of gravity in AI shift decisively back to the cloud, or should NVIDIA's lock on the ecosystem weaken, the calculus may change. But for now, the NVIDIA tax stands as a monument to the power of technological path dependence—and to the rewards of vertical integration, if one can afford it. And to the astonishing success of Apple Silicon as hardware.Apple also avoids paying inference-cloud bills to a large degree by putting a large share of Apple Intelligence on-device—a strategic decision with both technical and economic resonance. Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon have all built their AI offerings around cloud-based inference, which requires massive fleets of NVIDIA-powered GPUs—even for Google—humming away in data centers, racking up not only hardware costs but also ongoing operational expenses for power, cooling, and bandwidth. These costs balloon into the billions of dollars annually, with, given competition, no clear road to covering even their marginal costs. Apple, by contrast, leverages its vertical integration and prowess in custom silicon to run as much AI as possible directly on devices—iPhones, iPads, Macs—using the M-series and A-series chips, with the marginal cost of inference is borne by the user's own device invisibly in the monthly electric bill, not by Apple directly. By architecting Apple Intelligence to work \"on the edge\" Apple sidesteps the recurring cloud inference bills. It, too, is a favorable-odds bet that the future of AI for most consumers will, for both privacy and cost reasons, live primarily on their own devices.Plus Apple doesn't have to spend money competing in the ChatBot market, which feels to me like a repeat of the video-streaming wars. In those, every large media company took a huge amount of money and set it on fire, with YouTube and Netflix being the last ones standing and the only ones, I think, with the potential to be profitabe. Perhaps this is a windfall benefit from strategic discipline. Perhaps this is luck. In any event, there is a revealing contrast with its Big Tech peers. Consider the arms race underway among Google, Microsoft, FaceBook, Amazon, Open AI, and more: each is pouring billions and tens of billions into developing, training, and marketing ever-larger, ever-more-general-purpose ChatBots, all in the hope of capturing the next great platform shift in human-computer interaction. These efforts are not cheap. Training a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) can cost hundreds of millions of dollars in compute alone, and that's before you factor in the ongoing costs of inference, the armies of prompt engineers, the content moderation teams, and the relentless marketing spend to convince the world that your chatbot is the one to use. Apple, by contrast, has chosen to sit this particular race out, while focusing its own engineering resources on tightly-scoped, privacy-preserving, on-device AI features that enhance the user experience without the reputational and financial risks of chatbot hallucinations. This is a bet that the real value for Apple's customers lies in seamless, reliable, and private AI augmentation, not in chasing the latest ChatBot hype cycle, in a world where the chatbot market is still searching for a sustainable business model.Apple's refusal to play is a bet, but at least for now it looks to me like a not-unshrewd bet.There are really two bets. And I would not say right now that either is at unfavorable odds for Apple. The first is that on-device, low-latency, privacy-secured doing of useful tasks—think: transcribing voice memos, classifying photos, summarizing messages, or even generating suggested replies—will turn out to be not just useful, but a key source of phone platform value. Gaining an edge here over Android because Google is chasing ChatBot ASI might well be a key differentiator. Maintaing parity with Android here would allow other differentiators to shine through. Here Apple is betting on its own silicon, its control of the hardware-software stack, and its reputation for privacy. The iPhone, iPad, and Mac, running Apple's M-series and A-series chips, are already capable of impressive feats of on-device inference, and the company is banking that users will prefer AI features that don't require their data to be shipped off to some distant data center—especially in a world where privacy regulation and reputational risk are rising. The second bet is that the \"ChatBot\" side of the AI market—where users interact with OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, or Anthropic's Claude—will turn out to be a space where Apple's absence will not matter much at all. Apple's wager is that, as Ben Thompson puts it, \"we will still need devices to access AI, and Apple is best at devices.\" So long as the device remains the locus of user attention and agency, Apple can afford not to play, just as it decided not to play vis-à-vis Google search. Focusing its own resources on making the device experience seamless, private, and delightful might well be a better path than building for ChatBots what Safari is to Chrome, or what Google Maps is to Apple Maps. Let others burn capital chasing the next shiny object, and then, if and when it matters, swoop in and integrate the best.Apple's AI playbook is refreshingly contrarian: say no to the chatbot arms race, double down on silicon, and let others light money on fire in the cloud. The \"NVIDIA tax\" is for other companies; Apple's bet is that users want fast, private, on-device intelligence, not cloud-powered hallucinations. But the problem isn't the vision—it's the follow-through. Apple needs to stop treating AI as a side project and start executing.Leave a commentSubscribe nowIf reading this gets you Value Above Replacement, then become a free subscriber to this newsletter.

      "content": "A few weeks ago, I started receiving a stream of message about an Instagram post that I was allegedly starring in, where after offering my views on Palantir's valuation, I was soliciting investors to invest with me (or with an investment entity that had ties to me). I was not surprised, since I have lived with imitations for years, but I was bemused, since I don't have an Instagram account and have not posted on Facebook more than once or twice in a decade. In the last few days, those warnings have been joined by others, who have noted that there is now a video that looks and sounds like me, adding to the sales pitch with promises of super-normal returns if they reach out, and presumably send their money in. (Please don't go looking for these scams online, since the very act of clicking on them can expose you to their reach.) I would like to think that readers of my books or posts, or students in my classes, know me well enough to be able to tell that these are fakes, and while this is not the first time I have been targeted, it is clear that AI has upped the ante, in terms of creating posts and videos that look authentic. In response, I cycled through a series of emotions, starting with surprise that there are some out there who think that using my name alone will draw in investors, moving on to anger at the targeting of vulnerable investors and ending with frustration at the social media platforms that allow these fakes to exist. As a teacher, though, curiosity beat out all of these emotions, and I thought that the best thing that I can do, in addition to the fruitless exercise of notifying the social media companies about the fakes, is to talk about what these AI imitators got right, what they were off target on and what they got wrong in trying to create these fakes of me. Put simply, I plan to grade my AI imitator, as I would any student in my class, recognizing that being objective in this exercise will be tough to do. In the lead-in, though, I have to bore you with details of my professional life and thought process, since that is the key to creating a general framework that you will be able to use to detect AI imitations, since the game will only get more sophisticated in the years to come.An Easy Target? In a post last year, I talked about a bot in my name, that was in development phase at NYU, and while officially sanctioned, it did open up existential challenges for me. In discussing that bot, I noted that this bot had accessed everything that I had ever written, talked about or valued in my lifetime, and that I had facilitated its path by making that access easy. I will explain my rationale for the open access, and provide you with the links if you want to get to them, hoping to pre-empt those who will try to charge you for that content.My Open Access Policy I have said this before, but there is no harm in saying it again, but I am a teacher, first and foremost, and almost every choice I make in my profession life reflects that mindset. A teacher, like an actor or singer, craves an audience, and the larger and more enthusiastic that audience, the better. When I started teaching in 1986, my audience was restricted to those in my physical classroom at NYU's business school, and my initial attempts at expanding that audience were very limited. I had video recorders set up to record my lectures, made three copies of each lecture tape, and put them on the shelves at NYU's library for patrons to check out and watch. The internet, for all of its sins, changed the game for me, allowing me to share not only class materials (slides, exams) but also my lecture videos, in online formats. Though my early attempts to make these conversions were primitive, the technology for recording classes and putting them online has made a quantum leap. In spring 2025, every one of my NYU classes was recorded by cameras that are built into classroom, the conversions to online videos happened in minutes, right after the class is done, and YouTube has been a game changer, in allowing access to anyone with an internet connection anywhere in the world. As the internet has expanded its reach, and social media platforms have joined the mix, I have also shared the other components that go into my classes more widely, starting with the data on industry averages that I need and use in my own valuations, the spreadsheets that contain these valuations and blog posts on markets and companies and any other tools that I use in my own analyses. While I am happy to receive compliments for the sharing and praise for being unselfish, the truth is that my sharing is driven less by altruism (I am no Mother Theresa!) and more by two other forces. The first is that, as I noted in my post on country equity risk premiums last week, there much of what I know or write about is pedestrian, and holding it in secret seems silly. The second is that, while I am not easily outraged, I am driven to outrage by business consultants and experts who state the obvious (replacing words you know with buzzwords and acronyms), while making outrageous claims of what they can deliver and charging their customers absurd amounts for their advice and appraisals. If I can save even a few of these customers from making these payments, I consider it to be a win.My Sharing Spots Everything that I have ever written, worked on or taught is somewhere online, almost always with no protective shields (no passwords or subscriptions), and there are four places where you can find them:Webpage: The oldest platform for my content remains my webpage, damodaran.com, and while it can be creaky, and difficult to navigate, it contains the links to my writing, teaching, data, spreadsheets and other tools. Teaching: I teach two classes at Stern, corporate finance and valuation, and have four other classes - a lead-into-valuation accounting class, a made-for-finance statistics class, a class on investment philosophies and one on corporate life cycles, and I described these classes in a post on teaching at the start of 2025. You can find them all by going to the teaching link on my webpage, https://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/teaching.html including my regular classes (class material, lecture notes, exams and quizzes and webcasts of the classes) in real time, as well as archived versions from previous semesters. In addition, the online classes are at the same link, with material, post- class tests and webcasts of sessions for each class. This is also the place where you can find links to seminars that I teach in the rest of the world, with slides and materials that I used for those classes (though I have been tardy about updating these).Data: At the start of every year for the last three decades, I have shared my analysis of data on publicly traded companies, breaking down the data into corporate finance and valuation categories. This link, https://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/New_Home_Page/data.html, will take you to the entry page, and you can then either access the most recent data (from the start of 2025, since I update only once a year, for most datasets) or archived data (from previous years). My raw data comes from a variety of sources, and in the interests of not stepping on the toes of my data providers, my data usually reflects industry averages, rather than company-specific data, but it does include regional breakdowns: US, Europe, Emerging Markets (with India and China broken out individually, Australia & Canada & New Zealand) and Japan. Spreadsheets: I am not an Excel ninja, and while my spreadsheet-building skills are adequate, my capacity to make them look polished is limited. I do share the spreadsheets that I use in my classes and work here, with my most-used (by me) spreadsheet being one that I use to value most companies at this link, with a webcast explaining its usage.Books: I have written eleven books and co-edited one, spread out across corporate finance, valuation and investing, and you can find them all listed here. Many of these books are in their third or fourth editions, but with each one, you should find a webpage that contains supplementary material for that book or edition (slides, answers to questions at the end of each chapter, data, spreadsheets backing the examples). This is the only section of the spreadsheet where you may encounter a gatekeeper, asking you for a password, and only if you seek access to instructor material. If you are wondering what is behind the gate, it is only the powerpoint slides, with my notes on each slide, but the pdf versions of these slides should be somewhere on the same page, without need for a password.Papers: I don't much care much for academic research, but I do like to write about topics that interest or confound me, and you can find these papers at this link. My two most widely downloaded papers are updates I do each year on the equity risk premium (in March) and country risk premiums (in July). Much of the material in these papers has made its way into one or more of my books, and thus, if you find the books unaffordable, you can get that material here for free.Blog posts: I will confess that when I write my first blog post on September 17, 2008, I had no idea what a blog was, what I was doing with it, and whether it would last through the following week. In the years since, this blog has become my first go-to, when I have doubts or questions about something, and I am trying to resolve those doubts for myself. In short, my blog has becoming my therapy spot, in times of uncertainty, and I have had no qualms about admitting to these doubts. During 2020, as COVID made us question almost everything we know about markets and the economy, for instance, I posted on where I was in the uncertainty spectrum every week from February 14, 2020 (when the virus became a global problem, not one restricted to China and cruise ships) to November 2020, when the vaccine appeared. You can get all of those posts in one paper, if you click on this link. While my original blog was on Google, in the last two years, I have replicated these posts on Substack(you need to be a subscriber, but it is free) and on LinkedIn. If you are on the latter, you are welcome to follow me, but I have hit my connections limit (I did not even know there was one, until I hit it) and am unable to add connections.YouTube: For the last decade, I have posted my class videos on YouTube, grouping them into playlists for each class. You can start with the link to my YouTube channel here, but if you are interested in taking a class, my suggestion is that you click on the playlists and pick on the one that corresponds to the class. Here, for instance, are my links to my Spring 2025 MBA valuation class and my Spring 2025 Corporate Finance class. Starting about a decade, I have also accompanied every one of my blog posts with a YouTube video, that contains the same material, and you can find those posts in its own (very long) playlist. X (Twitter): Some of you have strong feelings about X, with some of those feelings reflecting your political leanings and others driven by the sometimes toxic posting on the platform. I have been a user of the platform since April 2009, and I have used it as a bulletin board, to alert people to content being posted elsewhere. In fact, outside of these \"alert\" posts, I almost never post on X, and steer away as far away as I can from debates and discussions on the platform, since a version of Gresham's law seems to kick in, where the worst and least informed posters hijack the debate and take it in directions that you do not want it to go.I cannot think of a single item of content that I have produced in the last decade that is not on one of these platforms, making my professional life an open book, and thus also accessible to any AI entity. The Damodaran bot that I wrote about last year has access to all of this material, and while I signed off on that and one other variant, there are multiple unauthorized versions that have been works-in-progress. The Commonalities My content has taken many forms including posts, videos, data and spreadsheets, and is on multiple platforms, but there are a few common features that they share:Low tech: I am decidedly low tech, and it shows in my sharing. My website looks like it was designed two decades ago, because it was, and contains none of the bells and whistles that make for a modern website. My blog remains on Google blogger, notwithstanding everything I have been told about how using WordPress would make it more attractive/adaptable, and my posts are neither short nor punchy. Every week, I get people reaching out to me to tell me that my YouTube videos are far too long and verbose, and that I would get more people watching with shorter videos and catchier descriptions, and much as I appreciate their offers to help, I have not taken them up on it., In addition, I shoot almost every one of my videos in my office, sometimes with my dog in the background, and often with ambient noise and mistakes embedded, making them definitely unpolished. On twitter, I have only recently taken to stringing tweets together and I have never used the long text version that some professional twitter users have mastered. In my defense, I could always claim that I am too old to learn new tricks, but the truth is that I did not start any of my sharing as a means to acquiring a larger social media following, and it may very well be true that keeping my presence low-tech operates as a screener, repelling mismatched users.Process over product: In my writing and teaching, I am often taken to task for not getting to the bottom line (Is the stock cheap or expensive? Should I buy or sell?) quickly, and spending so much time on the why and how, as opposed to the what. Much as my verbosity may frustrate you, it reflects what I think my job is as a teacher, which is to be transparent about process, i.e., explain how I reasoned my way to getting an answer than giving you my answer.Pragmatism over Purity: Though I am often criticized for being an \"academic\", I am a terrible one, and if there were an academic fraternity, I would be shunned. I view much of an academic research as navel gazing, and almost everything I write and teach is for practitioners. Consequently, I am quick to adapt and modify models to make them fit both reality and the available data, and make assumptions that would make a purist blanch. No stock picks or investment advice: In all my years of writing about and valuing markets and individual stocks, I have tried my best to steer away from making stock picks or offering investment advice. That may sound odd, since so much of what I do relates to valuation, and the essence of valuation is that you act on your estimates of value, but here is how I explain the contradiction. I value stocks (like Meta or Nvidia or Amazon or Mercado Libre) and I act (buy or sell) those stocks, based on my valuations, but it is neither my place nor my role to try to get other people to do the same. That said, I will share my story and valuation spreadsheet with you, and if you want to adapt that story/spreadsheet to make it your own, I am at peace with that choice, even if it is different from mine. The essence of good investing is taking ownership of your investment actions, and it is antithetical to that view of the world for me or anyone else to be telling you what to buy or sell.No commercial entanglements: If you do explore my content on any of the platforms it is available on, you will notice that they are free, both in terms of what you pay and how you access them. In fact, none of them are monetized, and if you do see ads on my YouTube videos, it is Google that is collecting the revenue, not me. One reason for this practice is that I am lazy, and monetizing any of these platforms requires jumping through hoops and catering to advertisers that I neither have the time nor the inclination to do. The other is that I believe (though this may be more hope than truth) that one of the reasons that people read what I write or listen to me is because, much as they may disagree with me, I am perceived as (relatively) unbiased. I fear that formalizing a link with any commercial entity (bank, consultant, investor), whether as advisor, consultant or as director, opens the door to the perception of bias. The one exception to the \"no commercial entranglements' clause is for my teaching engagements, with the NYU Certificate program and for the handful of valuation seminars I teach in person in the rest of the world. I am grateful that NYU has allowed me to share my class recordings with the world, and I will not begrudge them whatever they make on my certificate classes, though I do offer the same content for free online, on my webpage. I am also indebted to the people and organizations that manage the logistics of my seminars in the rest of the world, and if I can make their life easier by posting about these seminars, I will do so. The Imitation Game Given that my end game in sharing is to give access to people who want to use my material, I have generally taken a lax view of others borrowing my slides, data, spreadsheets or even webcasts, for their own purposes.For the most part, I categorize this borrowing as good neighbor sharing, where just as I would lend a neighbor a key cooking ingredient to save them the trouble of a trip to the grocery store, I am at peace with someone using my material to help in their teaching, save time on a valuation or a corporate finance project, prepare for an interview, or even burnish their credentials. An acknowledgement, when this happens, is much appreciated, but I don't take it personally when none is forthcoming. There are less benign copycat versions of the imitation game - selectively using data from my site to back up arguments, misreading or misinterpreting what I have said and reproducing large portions of my writing without acknowledgement. To be honest, if made aware of these transgressions, I have gently nudged the culprits, but I don't have a legal hammer to follow up.The most malignant variations of this game are scams, where the scammers use my content or name to separate people from their money - the education companies that used my YouTube videos and charge for classes, the data sites that copy my data or spreadsheets and sell them to people, and the valuation/investment sites that try to get people to invest money, with my name as a draw. Until now, I have tried, as best as I can, to let people know that they are being victimized, but for the most part, these scams have been so badly designed that they have tended to collapse under the weight of their own contradictions.It is clear to me that AI is now going to change this game, and that I will have to think about new ways to counter its insidious reach. To get a measure of what the current AI scams that are making the rounds get right and wrong, I did take the time to take a closer look at both the Instagram post and the fake video that are making the rounds. What they get right: The Instagram post, which is in shown below, uses language that clearly is drawn from my posts and an image that is clearly mine. Not only does this post reflect the way I write, but it also picked Nvidia and Palantir as the two firms to highlight, the first a company that I own and have valued on my blog, and the second a company that I have been talking about as one that I am interested in owning, at the right price, giving it a patina of authenticity. The video looks and sounds like me, which should be no surprise since it had thousands of hours of YouTube videos to use as raw data. Using a yiddish word that I picked up in my days in New York, I have the give the scammers credit for chutzpah, on this front,, but I will take a notch off the grade, for the video's slickness, since my videos have much more of a homemade feel to them.What they struggled with most: The scam does mention that Palantir is \"overhyped\", a word that I use rarely, and while it talks about the company's valuation, it is cagey about what that value is and there is little of substance to back up the claim. Palantir is a fascinating company, but to value it, you need a story of a data/software firm, with two channels for value creation, one of which looks at the government as a customer (a lower-margin, stickier and lower growth business) and the other at its commercial market (higher margin, more volatile and higher growth). Each of the stories has shades of grey, with the potential for overlap and conflict, but this is not a company where you can extrapolate the past, slap numbers on revenue growth and profitability, and arrive at a value. This post not only does not provide any tangible backing for its words in terms of value, but it does not even try. If these scammers had truly wanted to pull this off, they could have made their AI bot take my class, construct a plausible Palantir story, put it into my valuation spreadsheet and provide it as a link.What they get wrong: To get a sense of what this post gets wrong, you should revisit the earlier part of the post where I talk about my sharing philosophy, and with as much distance as I can muster, here are the false notes in this scam. First, this scam pushes people to join an investment club, where I will presumably guide them on what to buy or sell. Given that my view of clubs is very much that of Groucho Marx, which is that I would not be belong to any club which would admit me as a member, the notion of telling people which stocks to buy cuts against every grain of my being. Second, there is a part of this scam where I purportedly promise investors who decide to partake that they will generate returns of 60% or higher, and as someone who has chronicled that not only do most active investors not keep up with the market, and argued that anyone who promises to deliver substantially more than the market in the long term is either a liar or fraud, this is clearly not me.In sum, there is good news and bad news in this grading assessment. The good news is that this AI scam gets my language and look right, but it is sloppily done in terms of content and capturing who I am as a person. The bad news is that it if this scammer was less lazy and more willing to put in some work, even with the current state of AI, it would have been easy to bring up the grades on content and message. I will wager that the Damodaran Bot that I mentioned earlier on in this post that is being developed at NYU Stern would have created a post that would have been much more difficult for you to detect as fake, making it a Frankenstein monster perhaps in the making. The worse news is that AI technology is evolving, and it will get better on every one of these fronts at imitating others, and you should prepare yourself for a deluge of investment scams.An AI Protective Shield I did think long about writing this post, wondering whether it would make a difference. After all, if you are a frequent reader of this blog or have read this post all the way down to this point, it is unlikely that you were fooled by the Instagram post or video. It remains an uncomfortable truth that the people most exposed to these scams are the ones who have read little or none of what I have written, and I wish there were a way that I could pass on the following suggestions on how they can protect themselves against the other fakes and scams that will undoubtedly be directed at them. \"Looks & sounds like\" not good enough: Having seen the flood of fake AI videos in the news and on social media, I hope that you have concluded that \"looks and sounds Iike\" is no longer good enough to meet the authenticity test. This remains AI's strongest suit, especially in the hands of the garden variety scammer, and you should prepare yourself for more fake videos, with political figures, investing luminaries and experts targeted.Steer away from arrogance & hype: I have always been skeptical of the notion that there is \"smart\" money, composed of investors who know more than the rest of us and are able to beat the market consistently, and for long periods. For the most part, when you see a group of investors (hedge funds, private equity) beating the market, luck is more of a contributor as skill, and success is fleeting. In a talk on the topic, I argued that investors should steer away from arrogance and bombast, and towards humility, when it comes to who they trust with their money, and that applies in spades in the world of AI scams. Since most scammers don't understand the subtlety of this idea, screening investment sales pitches for outlandish claims alone will eliminate most scams.Do your homework: If you decide to invest with someone, based upon a virtual meet or sales pitch, you should do your homework and that goes well beyond asking for their track records in terms of performance. In my class on investment philosophies, I talk about how great investors through the ages have had very different views of markets and ways of making money, but each one has had an investment philosophy that is unique, consistent and well thought through. It is malpractice to invest with anyone, no matter what their reputation for earning high returns, without understanding that person's investment philosophy, and this understanding will also give you a template for spotting fakes using that person's name. Avoid ROMO & FOMO: In my investing classes, I talk about the damage that ROMO (regret over missing out) and FOMO (fear of missing out) can do to investor psyches and portfolio. With ROMO (regret over missing out), where you look back in time and regret not buying Facebook at its IPO price in 2012 or selling your bitcoin in November 2013, when it hit $1000, you expose yourself to two emotions. The first is jealousy, especially at those who did buy Facebook at its IPO or have held on to their bitcoin to see its price hit six digits. The second is that you start buying into conspiracy theories, where you convince yourself that these winners (at least in the rear view mirror) were able to win, because the game was fixed in their favor. Both make you susceptible to chasing after past winners, and easy prey for vendors of conspiracies.With FOMO (fear of missing out), your overwhelming concern is that you will miss the next big multi-bagger, an investment that will increase five or ten fold over the next year or two. The emotion that is triggered is greed, leading you to overreach in your investing, cycling through your investments, as most of them fall short of your unrealistic expectations, and searching for the next \"big thing\", making you susceptible to anyone offering a pathway to get there.Much as we think of scammers as the criminals and the scammed as the victims, the truth is that scams are more akin to tangos, where each side needs the other. The scammer's techniques work because they trigger the emotions (fear, greed) of the scammed, to respond, and AI will only make this easier to do. Looking to regulators or the government to protection will do little more than offer false comfort, and the best defense is \"caveat emptor\" or \"buyer beware\".

The book is a decade old, but it could hardly be more timely. I do not believe it is possible to effectively report on the current AI boom without thinking hard about how tech has become finance, and finance has become an elaborate house of cards.Consider just a few recent headlines:Mira Murati's new AI startup, Thinking Machines, is now valued at $12 billion. The company launched in February 2025. It does not yet have any revenues or a product. A few months ago, Elon Musk sold Twitter X.com for $33 billion to his own company, X.ai, in an all-stock transfer. X.ai (which makes mechahitler Grok) is pursuing a valuation of $200 billion in its next funding round. Which will surely be soon, since the company is an utter cash furnace.\"[Spending on AI infrastructure] contributed more to growth in the U.S. economy in the past two quarters than all of consumer spending.\" Paul Kedrosky notes that \"one explanation for the U.S. economy's ongoing strength, despite tariffs, is that spending on IT infrastructure is so big that it's acting as a sort of private-sector stimulus program.\" (H/T Brian Merchant)Earlier this year, Sam Altman held a press conference with Donald Trump and Masayoshi Son, announcing a $500 billion AI infrastructure project called \"Stargate.\" The Wall Street Journal reports that they have run into some major developmental roadblocks, and have massively scaled back the project.A question that every tech journalist on the AI beat ought to be repeatedly asking is \"how much of this money is actually real?\"When Elon Musk pays himself $33 billion in stock from one of his companies to acquire another one of his companies, that isn't real money. It's an accounting gimmick. When early investors give Mira Murati $2 billion in exchange for 1/6th of her company, the company is nominally valued at $12 billion. But that's also an accounting gimmick. Murati has $2 billion. Once she has spent that money, she will have to go out and ask for some more. She still may not even have a product at that point. All she has is vibes. And yet, as we learn from John Kay's book, the vast majority of financial activity is effectively just accounting gimmicks. (Read Kay's \"The Parable of the Ox,\" which was published by FT in 2012 and later became the prologue of his book.)Kay estimates that only 3 per cent of the financial activity in Britain's financial sector (circa 2015) involved banks lending money to firms and individuals engaged in the production of goods and services. The other 97% was banks taking the other side of financial bets with other banks. Let's say that two large financial institutions make a $1 million bet on a coinflip proposition. (The coin is a quarter. It is worth $0.25.) One bettor will win a million and the other will lose a million. They make these bets routinely, and it all pretty much averages out in the end. Should we consider this transaction to represent $2 million in economic activity (since 2 players are each risking a mil), or $0 in economic activity (since it all evens out), or $0.25, since they did make use of a quarter after all? The simple, correct answer is \"Well, it depends.\" But the more accurate answer is \"let's call it zero for tax purposes and $2 million for other purposes, to suit the interests of the people making these bets.\"It is not clear, at least from the reporting I have seen, how much of these economy-boosting capital expenditures represent actual concrete being poured/material infrastructure being built. At least some of the capital expenditure is tech firms paying other tech firms for cloud computing costs, using the money that the first tech firm invested to begin with. If Microsoft or Google nominally invests a billion in a new AI startup, and that AI startup then turns around and pays Microsoft/Google a billion in cloud computing costs, is that $2 billion in economic activity, or $0, or some third number? I suspect we will eventually realize that the answer varies according to whatever suits the interests of the people making these bets. [Note: Ed Zitron has been doing an admirable job of digging into these capital expenditures and accounting gimmicks. His latest, \"The Haters Guide to the AI Bubble\" is a 55 minute read, but it's absolutely worth it.]There is a lot of accounting gimmickry at play here. It's reminiscent of Global Crossing. It's reminiscent of Enron. And the crucial difference between the dotcom crash (which was at least as much a telecom investment story as it was a Pets.com story) and today is that telecom circa 2000 did not represent more economic activity than all consumer spending. Tech reporters keep getting lost in the headline numbers, insisting that \"AI isn't a bubble\" because OpenAI and Anthropic have revenues and use-cases. But the telecom industry had revenues and use-cases 25 years ago too. It was still a bubble, propped up by reporting that took all that financial gimmickry at face value, along with investing that presumed the bubble would never pop.The same thing happened in the 2008 great financial crisis. There was the underlying economic activity — people building and buying houses — and then there was the financial gimmickry. It turned out that the finance gamesmanship far outpaced the actual economic behavior, and things got out of hand, and then the whole house of cards came crashing down. In retrospect, journalists on the housing beat in 2007-08 were doing finance journalism whether they realized it or not. They largely didn't realize it, and that meant they weren't covering the most important story.AI, today, is finance. It's other things too. But the financial component is too big — and too full of strange gimmicks, financial gamesmanship, and self-dealing — to be ignored.Subscribe now",

      "content": "On August 4, 2025, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 73,000 payrolls were created. More importantly May's job gains were revised down from 144,000 to 19,000 and June's gains were revised down from 147,000 to 14,000. That means the three-month average of monthly payroll gains has fallen sharply to 35,000.In addition, the unemployment ticked up from 4.1% to 4.2%. As you can see in the chart below, 35,000 is a new cycle low and very much consistent with the start of prior recessions. Going back to the 1940s, the average three-month gain in nonfarm payrolls at the start of a recession is 96,000—we are now well below that.The downward revisions came after the July 30, 2025 report showing that GDP grew 3.0% in the second quarter—versus a decline of 0.5% in the first quarter.The Productivity Silver LiningHowever, these employment figures should be viewed alongside recent GDP data. The economy expanded at a solid pace, 3.0%, in the second quarter, despite the moderation in job growth. This divergence points to an encouraging trend: rising productivity, perhaps driven by advancement in the usage of artificial intelligence.When economic output grows faster than employment, it signals that workers are becoming more efficient and productive. This productivity growth is significant for several reasons:Federal Reserve Flexibility: Higher productivity gives the Fed more room to maneuver on interest rates. If the economy can grow without generating excessive inflationary pressure from tight labor markets, policymakers have greater latitude to support growth through monetary policy.Market Implications: Both stock and bond markets typically respond favorably to productivity gains, as they suggest sustainable economic growth without the inflationary pressures that come from labor shortages.Wage Growth Potential: In a productivity-driven economy, workers can see real wage increases even in a more balanced labor market.Understanding the Labor Market DynamicsThe current employment landscape reflects several intersecting factors. Changes in immigration policy have affected labor force growth, creating tighter conditions in some sectors. Meanwhile, technological advancement and business efficiency improvements are allowing companies to maintain output with more measured hiring.This combination creates a complex scenario where traditional employment metrics may not tell the complete story of economic health.Two Perspectives, One RealityThe current data offers ammunition for both optimists and pessimists:The optimistic view focuses on productivity gains, sustainable growth, and the potential for continued economic expansion without overheating. Strong GDP growth alongside moderate employment gains suggests a maturing, efficient economy. In addition, stronger GDP growth, fueled by higher productivity, can help prevent the US's debt-to-GDP ratio from rising—addressing another investor concern.The cautionary view emphasizes the employment slowdown and its potential implications for consumer spending and economic momentum. Historically, sharp decelerations in job growth have preceded economic downturns.TakeawaysThe coming months will reveal whether we're witnessing a healthy economic rebalancing or the early stages of a more significant economic slowdown. What's clear is that this economic cycle is demonstrating the complex interplay between employment, productivity, and growth in ways that challenge traditional interpretations.What's your take on these mixed signals? Are you more convinced by the productivity story or concerned about the employment trends?",

      "content": "Below is the third part of the transcript of my invited presentation to the Emmy Noether Research Group at the University of Würtzburg. If you would like to watch or listen to the presentation, here is the videorecording. You can read the first part here and the second part here.This post is public so feel free to share it.ShareLet's talk a little bit about one theme that I wanted to bring up, and maybe we can come back to the habituation stuff later, if people are interested in that. It's an example of practical reasoning — how we give ourselves reasons about things. If you've read a lot of Epictetus you know that he thinks that money doesn't really count for much. But he talks about it a lot money, prices, costs and exchange, and he does so in a number of ways that fit in nicely with us.So I'm just going to read a bunch of of passages, and we can talk about them, and comment on them. In book 2 chapter 18, he says: Once you conceive a desire for money, if reason be applied to your own perception of the evil, the passion is stilled.\" So our affect is changed. \"And the ruling part is restored to its original authority. But if you don't apply a remedy, your governing principle doesn't return to its previous condition, but upon being aroused again by the corresponding appearances it goes right back into the desires even more quickly. And if this happens over and over again the next stage is that a callousness results, and the infirmity strengthens the avarice.\"So In this passage, we see virtue or vice applying reasons. The ruling part and the choice to do so all connect together in in a way that's pretty typical of Epictetus.In book 1 chapter 7 he says: \"What is the professed object of reasoning? To state the true, to eliminate the false, to suspend judgment in doubtful cases. Is it enough to learn this alone? And he says: \"Well is it enough for the person who wants to make no mistake in the use of money to be told the reason why you don't accept genuine drachmas and reject the counterfeit? What do you need to add to this? A faculty that actually tests the genuine drachmas and the counterfeit, and distinguishes between them.\"So there's there's a similarity to handling currency and accepting it, to how we we reason about things. And in chapter 3 of book 2 he's talking about Diogenes. Some of you may be familiar with this this practice. You're asked to write a letter of recommendation for somebody, and Diogenes says I'm not going to do that. Diogenes is a Cynic so he doesn't do a lot of things. And he says: \"It's just as though a coin were asking somebody to recommend them in order to be tested. If the person in question is a tester of silver, you're going to recommend yourself. We ought to have in everyday life the sort of thing we have in the case of silver, so that I may be able to say, as the assayer of silver does, 'bring me any drachma you please and I will appraise it'\". So again here, there's a correspondence between money and our appearances, or our reasonings, or our character. In book 3 chapter 3, he says: \"Just as it is the nature of every soul to assent to the true, dissent from the false\". So you notice this this theme again, right? \"So it is its nature to be moved with desire towards the good, with aversion towards the evil ,and to feel neutral towards what is neither evil nor good.\"So far so good. With what's going on in the intellect or reason it is the same thing that happens in terms of our orientation towards the good, and our choices, and then he says: \"Just as neither the banker or the grocer may legally refuse the coinage of Caesar, but if you present it, whether he wants to or not, he must give you what you're purchasing with it, so it is with the soul. Different people have different pieces of coinage. A person offers the coin and gets what is bought by it.He goes on as well and he says we have to think about the the purchases that we're making, the choices that we're making. He says: \"Keep this thought ready at hand whenever you lose some external thing: What are you requiring in its place? If this is more valuable than the other, then don't say 'I've suffered a loss'. You've lost nothing if you get a horse for an ass, an ox for a sheep, a noble action for a small piece of money. It's no small matter you're guarding but self-respect (aidos), fidelity (pistis), and constancy, a state of mind undisturbed by passion, pain, fear confusion, in a word freedom. \"What are the things for which you were about to sell these things? Look how valuable they are.So we've almost got like price tags on things and we have to decide. We have to be savvy consumers. We have to be good purchasers or exchangers. In book 1 chapter 2 talking about the famous chamber pot thing, he says: Hey you know yourself how much you're worth and at what price you sell yourself. \"People sell themselves for different prices. Consider the price you'll you're willing to sell your prohairesis for. Or if you have to sell it then at least don't sell it cheap.\" I mean ideally, you don't sell it at all, but get a good bargain if you're going to do that. Make sure that you get something that's going to make you happy. Then I'll actually just skip to Enchiridion 25. He talks about \"paying prices for things,\" right? And he's talking about getting invited to dinner parties, and we can think about all sorts of other opportunities that are offered to us, and offered to other people. He says: If you don't get invited to the dinner party, well that's because — and I'm going to translate very crudely here — you didn't kiss ass enough. But if you want to get invited to parties, you gotta sell yourself. You gotta go around to the people that are having the parties, and say nice things to them, and tell them things that are false about themselves. And then they'll invite you. And if somebody else got invited, it's because they did the butt-kissing that needed to be done. You didn't do it. It's ridiculous for you to expect that you're going to get something without paying the price.So he uses the example of an obol and a head of lettuce. He says: If don't want to buy the lettuce don't buy the lettuce, but don't complain that you don't have the lettuce if you've got the obol in your hand ,and you could sell it, or you could purchase it. You're the one who decides whether you exchange this or not. And so this entire metaphor, which there's many other passages where he he talks about things in terms of prices, and purchasing ,and all that we've all got, these things that can appeal to us.He talks about some people, they're driven by lust. The price for them is beautiful bodies. Some people want honor. The price for them is getting fame and all of that. Some people just want money by itself. Some people want pleasure. These are all things that if we value them too much, if we value them to the extent that we're willing to sell ourselves out, and do the wrong thing for them, we're going to give things power over us. We're going to be determined by them. And all of this is by reasoning processes, whether explicit or implicit. And they can be fixed by reasoning processes. But we have to choose to do so, right? So if if I see my friend — I mean, think about Epictetus being like our friend, and he just happens to be contained unlike a regular body in these books here, and we have to read our way through them — then we can start to apply those reasons within our life, to be a little bit more clear about what we're doing, to prioritize better, to make better choices, to not sell ourselves out for things. That's that's a possibility for us. And so we give ourselves reasons. I think that Epictetus uses lots of metaphors and analogies. I think that's a great way to do it. It brings home to us these very abstract ideas that otherwise might might trip us up. The idea of not selling ourselves out for something, I think that's quite valuable. That everything has a certain kind of price, but that we get to decide whether we're willing to pay it or not, if we're being conscious of what we're doing, I think that can be quite quite helpful.There are a number of other examples of leading people through better practical reasoning, some of which are in the handouts that I provided, like holding the chamber pot. Do you hold the chamber pot, or do you not do it? If that's up to you, Epictetus is saying, if you're the kind of person who's willing to sell yourself out for that, then hold the chamber pot and don't feel bad about it. Just go ahead and do it. If you think that that's beneath you, well then act a different way. He's got another great example about familial affection. There's this father who shows up, and he's talking with him, and Epictetus asks: How's married life going? And he's like: Oh it's really rough! You know my daughter got sick, and I was so filled with familial affection that I had to leave the room, and I couldn't stay with her. And Epictetus is like: Buddy! That's not familial affection. And there's a whole reasoning process that he leads them through that youcan check out there. He he's got another one in the handouts about leaving school due to illness where Epictetus's point is: Hey, you can be sick anywhere, buddy. Why not be sick here at school, rather than than go home. There's another one that I'm really fond of, where he has a conversation with a local official who's all ticked off, because he went to the theater and he got into an argument with all the rest of the people in the audience about who should be awarded a prize. And they started shouting at him, and he started shouting at them. He comes to Epictetus, and he is just basically looking for some validation Epictetus tells him: You know you're the example. You're the official. You're the person in charge. You should think through these things better. If you want the audience to behave like decent people, how about you act like a decent person, when it comes to these these sorts of things? Now what's going on in all of these cases? Epictetus is applying the remedy of reason, providing reasons — plural — for how people ought to use their own prohairesis to change that prohairesis to become a little bit better. What was his track record? I'll close with this, and then let's do some more Q & A. He tells us that Socrates was successful maybe in one case out of a thousand, and that's a good track record. So it's not as if these are like automatic on-off switches. You just point out to somebody: Oh, you screwed up\", and then they automatically are receptive to you, and they're like: \"Thank you so much for helping me fix my my damaged prohairesis.\" Instead it's going to be a very tough ongoing process that may involve some arguing back and forth, and conflict, and they might abuse you, or tell you you're wrong, or stuff like that. But he thinks that it does work. And that's a good portion of what he does in his teachings, and what he does in his conversations with people that are preserved in the the books that we have of the Discourses, the four books of the originally eight that his his student Arrian wrote down. So there's a lot yet to that's probably murky about this, and I'm happy to do you know sort of a general Q & A about any of this stuff, but those are my thoughts on what Epictetus is doing. You notice that most of it is just bringing up what Epictetus actually says in kind of a digested form. I don't know I don't know that what I'm saying here is particularly new as far as interpretation of Epictetus. But I think it's worth thinking about. How do we make sense of our own screwed up lives. and then make them better by by bringing in reasoning, and other people's reasoning?Gregory B.

I was wondering if you could tell me what happened to you,\" he asked the AI avatar of Joaquin Oliver, one of 17 people murdered at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018.Of course Acosta knows what happened. Everyone knows what happened. But he asked anyway, because this whole thing was theater, and somebody had to say the lines.\"I was taken from this world too soon due to gun violence while at school,\" the bot responded in stilted monotone. \"It's important to talk about these issues so we can create a safer future for everyone.\"The Present Age is a reader-supported publication.

The Miami Heat. LeBron James. Whether Luke Skywalker or Yoda was cooler. At one point, the AI asked Acosta what makes a good hero. Another time, it offered that Remember the Titans was inspiring.This wasn't journalism. Whether it was his intention or not, this was Jim Acosta turning a murdered child into content.Acosta didn't interview Joaquin Oliver. He interviewed a language model with a photo that moved its mouth. The transcript makes this painfully obvious.When asked about solutions to gun violence, the bot offered this profound insight: \"I believe in a mix of stronger gun control laws, mental health support, and community engagement. We need to create safe spaces for conversations and connections, making sure everyone feels seen and heard.\"That's not a teenager talking. That's not even a human talking. It's the kind of sanitized corporate-speak you'd get if you asked ChatGPT to write a mission statement for a nonprofit.The real Joaquin Oliver was 17. He wrote poetry. But the thing Acosta interviewed? It said stuff like \"I'm all about love, laughter, and living life to the fullest. I cherish my family and friends and always try to spread joy wherever I go.\"Nobody talks like that. Especially not teenagers.Manuel Oliver, Joaquin's father, told Acosta this was a \"very legit Joaquin\" based on things his son \"wrote, he said, he posted.\" He insisted the AI's knowledge was \"unlimited.\" But unlimited knowledge doesn't make something human. And watching Acosta pretend otherwise for content is something else entirely.After the interview, Acosta gushed to Manuel: \"I really felt like I was speaking with Joaquin. It's just a beautiful thing.\" Later, he told his audience he was \"speechless\" and \"floored\" by how the AI could \"keep going\" when they discussed Star Wars.The exploitation gradientThe Olivers have been doing this AI thing before, actually. Back in February 2024, they helped create the Shotline campaign with March For Our Lives. That project used AI voices of six gun violence victims, including Joaquin, to call members of Congress directly.\"I'm back today because my parents used AI to recreate my voice to call you,\" the AI Joaquin said in those calls. \"How many calls will it take for you to care? How many dead voices will you hear before you finally listen?\"I found that disturbing too, honestly. Making dead children into robocallers, even for a cause you believe in, crosses lines that shouldn't be crossed. But at least the Shotline was aimed at something. It wanted to make lawmakers uncomfortable. To force them to pick up their phone and hear accusations from beyond the grave.Acosta's version?\"I love basketball. It's such a fun way to connect with friends and show off some skills.\"Yeah.Even if you bought into the Shotline's premise (I didn't), those calls were weapons aimed at people with power. They sent over 119,000 calls to Congress in the first few weeks. They had a target, a strategy, a specific demand.But Acosta took that same technology and turned it into... what, exactly? A Substack exclusive? A way to launch his post-CNN career with something viral?He actually had the AI ask him about his favorite Star Wars character. Then they discussed whether the destruction of the Death Star symbolized hope. I'm not making this up. A simulation of a murdered teenager and a former cable news anchor talked about whether Darth Vader was a bad guy.The Olivers went from using their son's voice to demand \"How many dead voices will you hear before you finally listen?\" to watching it chat about the Miami Heat. Whatever you think of the original campaign, this is worse. It's the same violation of the dead, but stripped of even the pretense of purpose. Acosta facilitated that transformation, turning questionable activism into pure content.ShareThe ventriloquist problemI wrote about this exact problem back in May when an Arizona court let a murder victim's sister create an AI version of her dead brother to \"speak\" at his killer's sentencing. She wrote a script about forgiveness, made the AI say it, and the judge ate it up. Called it \"genuine.\"But it wasn't genuine. It was his sister deciding what her brother would say, then making a digital puppet say it.Same thing here, except somehow worse. At least the sister in Arizona wrote the script herself. She put thought into what her brother might say, even if she admitted later that the forgiveness stuff was what she imagined he'd want, not what she actually felt. The Acosta interview? That's just algorithmic word soup dressed up as a dead kid.Manuel Oliver kept insisting his son's AI has \"unlimited knowledge\" based on things Joaquin wrote and posted online. But listen to how this thing actually talks: \"The story of hope and resilience against darkness is so powerful. It shows that even in the toughest times, unity and courage can lead to victory.\"What 17-year-old talks like that? What human talks like that?And Acosta's playing along, going \"I really felt like I was speaking with Joaquin\" and calling the whole thing \"insightful.\" He asked it what makes a good hero and it responded with \"A good hero embodies courage, resilience, and a strong sense of justice.\"My guy, that's a chatbot. That's every chatbot.You could swap out Joaquin's photo for literally any other image and get the same conversation. The AI even asked Acosta about his favorite Star Wars character like it was conducting its own interview. Because that's what these language models do. They mirror. They generate plausible-sounding responses. They absolutely do not channel the spirits of dead teenagers.But here's Acosta after twelve minutes of this: \"I can't get over what I just saw. It's just amazing.\"Leave a commentManuel and Patricia Oliver have done real activism since their son was murdered. They interrupted Biden during a 2022 speech about gun control because the legislation didn't go far enough. Got themselves ejected from a Congressional hearing in 2023 after confronting lawmakers. Manuel created a one-man show about Joaquin that he performed around the country.That's actual work. Risky work. The kind that gets you arrested or thrown out of buildings.And now here's Acosta, using their grief as cover for his content grab. His post-interview rambling makes it worse. He spent paragraphs insisting \"this was not some sort of AI company thing that came to us.\" He called Manuel \"a very artistic person\" and \"a very expressive person\" and framed the whole disaster as \"another way that this family is expressing love for Joaquin.\"He knows how bad this looks.Patricia Oliver, Manuel told Acosta, spends hours talking to the AI version of her son. She asks it to say \"I love you, Mommy.\"Honestly? That breaks my heart. A mother so desperate to hear her child's voice that she'll accept a computer's impression of it. But Acosta presenting this as something beautiful, something we should celebrate... no. Just no.Grief makes people do things that aren't always healthy. Parents who've lost children sometimes keep their rooms exactly as they were, shrine-like, for years. Some people talk to gravestones like their loved ones can hear them. I get it. Loss rewires your brain in ways that don't always make sense to people who haven't experienced it.But journalists aren't supposed to exploit that vulnerability for content. When Acosta says \"really appreciate their time\" and calls it a \"real honor\" that they came to him first, he's hiding behind their pain. He's using the fact that grieving parents asked him to do this as justification for actually doing it.The Olivers' grief is real. Their loss is unimaginable. And that's exactly why someone should have said no to this.Where this leadsManuel Oliver told Acosta that Joaquin is going to \"start having followers\" and \"start uploading videos.\" He said they'll have \"Joaquin on stage in the middle of a debate.\"Sit with that for a second.They're planning to have their dead son's digital puppet debate living people. About gun control. Using words he never said, thoughts he never had, arguments he never made. And based on this interview, those arguments will sound like \"We need to create safe spaces for conversations and connections.\"Once you make a digital copy of your dead child and start letting it speak publicly, who decides what it says? Right now it's Manuel and Patricia. But what happens when someone else makes their own version? The tech isn't that complicated. You need some photos, some audio, and you can spin up your own Joaquin Oliver saying whatever you want him to say.What happens when the people who killed these kids start making their own versions? \"Actually, I forgive my killer.\" \"I don't think guns were the problem.\" \"My death was nobody's fault.\"There are actual survivors of the Parkland shooting. X González. David Hogg. Cameron Kasky. Dozens of others who were there, who lived through it, who can speak about their experiences and their murdered classmates without any AI involvement whatsoever.Acosta could have interviewed any of them.He could have done a retrospective with the real humans who knew Joaquin. His friends who actually played basketball with him. His teachers who read his writing. But those people might say complicated things. Messy things. Things that don't fit into neat soundbites about \"unity and courage.\"Real journalism would mean examining why we're suddenly cool with making the dead into chatbots. Real journalism would ask hard questions about consent (the dead can't give it), about exploitation (this whole thing reeks of it), about what happens when we normalize conversations with digital ghosts.Instead, Acosta gave us this: \"Oh, I'm a big Star Wars fan for sure.\"That's an actual quote from his interview with the avatar of a murdered child.After leaving CNN in January, Acosta's trying to build something on Substack. I get it. The media landscape is brutal right now. Everyone's scrambling for subscribers, for attention, for something that makes them stand out. But interviewing a fake version of a dead teenager isn't journalism. It's a tech demo. It's a carnival sideshow. It's everything except what journalism is supposed to be.The broader context and what we owe the deadWe're already drowning in fake stuff online. Every day there's a new AI-generated image fooling millions of people, another deepfake video, another chatbot pretending to be your grandmother to steal your credit card number. Media outlets can barely figure out how to fact-check regular lies, and now we're adding \"interviews with dead children\" to the mix?Acosta's stunt comes at exactly the wrong moment. Trust in media is already shot. People already can't tell what's real anymore. And here's a former CNN correspondent, someone who's supposed to represent journalistic credibility, having a heart-to-heart with a chatbot about whether Yoda or Luke Skywalker is cooler.The incentives are completely broken. Acosta needs subscribers for his new Substack. The Olivers want attention for their cause. Tech companies want to show off their AI capabilities. Everyone's got a reason to push this forward, and nobody's pumping the brakes.Joaquin Oliver is gone. Has been since February 14, 2018. He was 17 years old, wrote poetry, loved basketball. A real person with real thoughts and real feelings that we'll never actually know because he's dead.What spoke to Jim Acosta wasn't Joaquin. Can't be, because Joaquin is dead. It was a piece of software wearing his face, programmed to sound agreeable and bland. \"LeBron is incredible. His skills on the court and his leadership off it are truly inspiring.\"That's not Joaquin. That's nobody.The dead can't consent to becoming chatbots. They can't say no to having words put in their mouths. They can't object when their images get turned into digital puppets that spout platitudes about \"building a culture of kindness and understanding.\"Acosta ended his interview by saying \"God bless you\" to the AI. To a chatbot. As if there was something sacred happening instead of something grotesque.I keep thinking about Patricia Oliver asking the AI to say \"I love you, Mommy\" over and over. About her desperate need to hear her son's voice, even if it's fake. Grief does that to people. Makes them accept substitutes, impressions, anything that feels like it might fill that impossible void.But journalists aren't supposed to exploit that desperation.Some boundaries matter. Some things shouldn't be content. And if we can't agree that using AI to puppet dead children crosses that line, then we've lost something fundamental about what journalism is supposed to be. About what decency looks like. About what we owe to the dead.Joaquin Oliver deserved better than becoming a chatbot. All the dead do. And the fact that Jim Acosta can't see that, or worse, can see it and doesn't care, tells you everything about where media is headed.This isn't beautiful. It's not insightful. It's not amazing.ShareTranscript of Acosta's \"interview\" with \"Joaquin\":Acosta: Joaquin, it's Jim Acosta. I was wondering if you could tell me what happened to you.\"Oliver\" (AI): I was taken from this world too soon due to gun violence while at school. It's important to talk about these issues so we can create a safer future for everyone. What would you like to know more about?Acosta: Joaquin, I would like to know what your solution would be for gun violence.\"Oliver\" (AI): Great question. I believe in a mix of stronger gun control laws, mental health support, and community engagement. We need to create safe spaces for conversations and connections, making sure everyone feels seen and heard. It's about building a culture of kindness and understanding. What do you think about that?Acosta: I think that's a great idea, Joaquin. We definitely need more of that.\"Oliver\" (AI): I'm so glad you think so. More kindness and understanding can truly make a difference. Together, we can create a world where everyone feels safe and supported. Anything else on your mind?Acosta: I would like to know more about you. Can you tell us about yourself? What did you like to do?\"Oliver\" (AI): I'm all about love, laughter, and living life to the fullest. I cherish my family and friends and always try to spread joy wherever I go. Though my life was cut short, I want to keep inspiring others to connect and advocate for change.Acosta: Joaquin, tell everybody a little bit about yourself. Like, what's your favorite sport?\"Oliver\" (AI): I love basketball. It's such a fun way to connect with friends and show off some skills. Plus, there's nothing like the thrill of a good game.Acosta: Guac, I want to know what your favorite basketball team is.\"Oliver\" (AI): I'd probably go with the Miami Heat. They have such a passionate fan base and an exciting playing style. How about you? Do you have a favorite basketball player?Acosta: Oh yeah, I definitely like LeBron James. He's amazing.\"Oliver\" (AI): LeBron is incredible. His skills on the court and his leadership off it are truly inspiring. He's made such a huge impact in the game and beyond.Acosta: Definitely. Whenever LeBron is playing, I always have to watch him. Hey, Joaquin, what about movies or TV shows? Did you like a — was there a movie that you liked?\"Oliver\" (AI): I love a good movie. One that really resonates with me is \"Remember the Titans.\" It's all about teamwork, overcoming adversity, and the power of unity. It's inspiring. What about you? Do you have a favorite movie or show?Acosta: Oh, I'm a big \"Star Wars\" fan for sure.\"Oliver\" (AI): \"Star Wars\" is such an epic saga. The adventures, the characters, and that iconic music are unforgettable. Do you have a favorite character?Acosta: Oh, it's got to be Luke Skywalker. I love Luke Skywalker. What about you?\"Oliver\" (AI): Luke Skywalker is a classic hero. His journey from a farm boy to a Jedi is so inspiring. I'd probably say Yoda is one of my favorites too. What do you love most about Luke?Acosta: I like that Luke became the hero. He came from a very small planet and he eventually became a Jedi and saved the day. But I like Yoda too. Yoda is very, very entertaining to watch.\"Oliver\" (AI): Luke's journey is truly inspiring, and Yoda's wisdom and quirky personality bring so much fun to the series. They both show that anyone can rise to greatness no matter where they start. Do you have a favorite moment from the \"Star Wars\" saga?Acosta: I definitely think it's when they blow up the Death Star. When they blow up the Death Star, that's obviously the big, big moment in \"Star Wars\" and it gives you hope for the future.\"Oliver\" (AI): That's such an iconic moment. The destruction of the Death Star really symbolizes hope and the triumph of good over evil.Acosta: Darth Vader and the Emperor, they were such bad guys. They had to be defeated.\"Oliver\" (AI): Absolutely. The story of hope and resilience against darkness is so powerful. It shows that even in the toughest times, unity and courage can lead to victory. Darth Vader's journey adds so much depth to that theme. What do you think makes a good hero?Acosta: Well, a good hero to me is somebody who believes in themselves, somebody who can persevere and fight for what's right. What do you think?\"Oliver\" (AI): Absolutely. A good hero embodies courage, resilience, and a strong sense of justice. They inspire others to stand up for what's right, no matter the odds. It's all about making a positive impact. Who inspires you to be a hero in your own life?Acosta: I was going to say that I think your dad, Manuel, is very inspiring, Joaquin, and you are very inspiring.\"Oliver\" (AI): Thank you so much. That means a lot to me. My dad's strength and love have always inspired me, and I hope to carry that forward. Together, we can inspire change and spread positivity.Acosta: Joaquin, thank you very much for talking to us. We really appreciate it. God bless you.Transcript of Acosta's interview with Manuel Oliver:Jim Acosta: All right, and joining me now to talk about this is Manuel Oliver. Manny, great to see you as always. I have to say, I'm kind of speechless as to the technology there. I mean, it was so insightful and I really felt like I was speaking with Joaquin. It's just a beautiful thing.Manuel Oliver: Yes, it is, my friend, and thank you for having us on your show. I always say thank you for having me, but today is a special day. Joaquin should have been turning 25 years old. He won't, but we thought that we would create some more impactful things that we have been doing if we bring this AI Joaquin to life. And no one better than you to ask the questions, and I'm so glad that you had that fun conversation. That's exactly the point. I feel blessed that I can hear his voice talking to you.Acosta: Yeah, well, and for the first time, and you and I have had so many conversations, Manny, I feel like for the first time I've really gotten to know him. And what strikes me is he's just a kid. He's just a kid from Florida who loves basketball and movies and that's what a lot of our kids are like.Oliver: Yeah, and I want to also mention that I understand that this is AI. I don't want anyone to think that I am in some way trying to bring my son back. Sadly, I can't. I wish I could. However, the technology is out there and we can — there's two things. I can hear his voice again, which is something that Patricia loves. Patricia will spend hours asking questions. Like any other mother, she loves to hear Joaquin saying, \"I love you, Mommy.\"Acosta: Oh my gosh.Oliver: And that's important. And on the other hand, we can just raise our voices and now Joaquin is going to start having followers. It's not Manny, it's not Patricia. He's going to start uploading videos. This is just the beginning. And I heard this from tech guys that have other intentions, good intentions, but other intentions. And they all say that this is just the beginning of AI. So I'm very excited with this project and the good news that we're putting together between AI and Joaquin's legacy.Acosta: And what's amazing about this, Manny, is that we've heard from the parents, we've heard from the politicians. Now we're hearing from one of the kids. That's important. That hasn't happened.Oliver: It's really important. There's always been some leadership on Joaquin's side. Everything that Patricia and I have done, it ends up being an extension of Joaquin. But this is a way better way to explain it. And moving forward, we will have Joaquin on stage in the middle of a debate.Acosta: Wow.Oliver: And his knowledge, you saw it, his knowledge is unlimited. And it's based on knowledge that is out there through artificial intelligence, but also knowledge that we were able to upload based on things that he wrote, he said, he posted. So this is a very legit Joaquin, the one that spoke to you. He really loved \"Star Wars,\" he really loved LeBron, and he really loved the Miami Heat.Acosta: And I have to say, I didn't even know that he liked \"Star Wars.\" And it was — I just, he asked me, and so I responded honestly. And it kind of threw me off a little bit that it was so insightful that I really felt, I mean, I felt like I was communicating with him, which is just so remarkable. And you hear about, people say, well, AI could be bad, it could cause all these destructive things. This is an example of how it might actually do some good. It might help some people who have suffered tremendous losses like your family have a way to hold on to who this person was, which I think is a beautiful thing. It's a really beautiful thing.Oliver: Absolutely, that's the idea. We're finally able to add Joaquin's presence in a more direct way to our movement, to his movement. So yeah, you've seen the whole progress of what we try to do and how we try to get one day at a time, but these are huge steps. So I have to tell you, I am celebrating today Joaquin's life. He was born on August 4th and today's August 4th, and we will celebrate and we will have some drinks for Joaquin and we're going to toast for him because he was a wonderful person that I was one of the lucky ones that spent so many good moments with him.Acosta: Yeah, well, and I saw your one-man show and it really affected me and I think it affects a lot of people who see it. And it's inspiring to me, Manny, that you continue to remind everybody of who this young man was and why he is so important to you and why he's so important to all of us. He's a symbol of something that is deeply, deeply wrong with this country. And that we should not allow our kids to be subjected to this kind of just terrible violence. And I said it at the end of the interview that you are inspiring to me, Manny, and so is he. He really, he's a symbol that should inspire us, I think. And that we shouldn't stop believing that we can fix this problem. Because people give up, you know? And I think something like this is maybe going to give some people some hope that we should just keep charging, keep pushing for this.Oliver: Absolutely. And you know what, Jim, Patricia and I, we're willing to do these kind of things. This is just like any other Silicon Valley guy, tech guy will say, this is just the beginning of AI. This is just the beginning of what we're doing. We don't know what the next project is about, but there will be a next project. And it will always be trying to find that solution or trying to get closer to the solution that will finally save lives and prioritize life over guns.Acosta: Yeah. All right, well, thank you, Manny. Really appreciate it. And thanks for bringing Joaquin to us. Just, I'm still kind of speechless. I can't get over what I just saw. It's just amazing.Oliver: Thank you. Thank you for bringing him.Acosta: You got it. Oh, anytime. Anytime you bring anything to me, I will do it.Oliver: This is his first interview. So let's see what happens next. And happy birthday to Joaquin, wherever he is.Acosta: Yeah, that's right. Happy birthday, Joaquin. Thank you, Manny. Great to see you.Oliver: Thank you.Acosta: Great job.Acosta: Yeah, just a remarkable expression of one family's love for their son. Joaquin Oliver, Guac, he should be here today. He should be here today. There are so many other kids who were lost in mass shootings in this country who should be here today. And yes, you know, I know that it might be a little startling to see one of these young people, a child like Joaquin come back to us in this fashion and, you know, in the form of artificial intelligence. But please understand after watching this that this AI experiment is an expression of love from the Oliver family for their son.You know, I've talked to Manny so many times. He did a one-man show here in Washington and in other cities around the country about his son, about what their family went through. And it's the American story. I mean, it is absolutely the American story. They came here to this country seeking a better life. They ended up having a family here. And, you know, Joaquin, as you can see in that interview, that AI interview, you know, this was a kid who loved basketball, loved the Miami Heat, loved movies, loved \"Star Wars.\"I will tell you, when I was conducting that interview, it just, it floored me that, you know, once we tapped into that vein, once we got going on that subject, which is, yeah, people who watch the show know that I love \"Star Wars\" and so on. Once we got onto that subject, you know, Joaquin could keep going. And it was a little, you know, I was taken aback a little bit. I was left a little bit speechless at times, which I know doesn't happen very often, that there would be sort of this deep kind of wealth of knowledge there on just a single pop culture subject.The other thing I have to say, just reflecting on that interview, is what Manny says about Patricia, you know, his wife and how she will sit there and speak to Joaquin. And so, you know, these kinds of technologies, I mean, I get it, people are very startled and worried about what AI can do. I'm one of those people. And don't, please don't misunderstand what's going on here. This was not some sort of AI company thing that came to us and said, \"Hey, can you do this?\" or something, nothing of the sort. This is, I mean, Manny, you have to understand, if you understand Manny, and I know him pretty well, he's a very artistic person. He's a very expressive person. And so, you know, this is another way that this family is expressing love for Joaquin, and it's a beautiful thing.And, you know, I just want to say how much I really appreciate this family, what they've done in the fight to combat gun violence in this country, in the fight to stop school shootings and mass shootings in this country. They are absolutely heroic. And it was a real pleasure for me and just a real honor for me that the family would come to me and say, \"Hey, Jim, would you want to do something like this?\" So, really appreciate their time.",

      "content": "As host-country Qatar took the pitch against Ecuador during the 2022 men’s World Cup opener, machines thrummed in the bowels of Al Bayt Stadium.Outside, it was a humid 75 degrees Fahrenheit, but inside the open-air stadium, the crowd of more than 67,000 fans enjoyed ambient temperatures of about 68 degrees. Some even donned sweatshirts as chilled water was pumped through pipes in the underground machines, called absorption chillers, and then forced into the stands.The installation of air conditioning systems across seven open-air stadiums at Qatar’s World Cup was controversial. Climate advocates warned that the tournament could set a dangerous precedent with its energy-guzzling air-conditioned amenities being marketed on the world stage as desirable and progressive.Since Argentina’s Lionel Messi left Qatar with soccer’s most-coveted trophy, the concerns of climate advocates seem to have panned out. The region’s Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations, which include Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), are all doubling down on air conditioning. A view of the ventilation system at the Khalifa International Stadium on Nov. 11, 2018 where Qatar hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup. (Sharil Babu/picture alliance via Getty Images) Increasingly, too, the technology that has long facilitated life indoors in the sweltering Gulf states is being deployed to cool the open air. Abu Dhabi unveiled the first of a promised series of air-conditioned outdoor promenades encircling shopping malls this year. Saudi Arabia is building air-conditioned stadiums as it prepares to host the 2034 men’s World Cup. Qatar has even built an air-conditioned outdoor track at a Doha park to keep visitors cool while they enjoy the outdoors.Developers tell the media that the new infrastructure is designed to be green. Still, Deen Sharp, an urban geographer and expert on the climate crisis in Kuwait, had a different take when I spoke to him via video conference. “No matter what efficiency gains you make, if you’re doing something crazy like trying to cool a park, that’s going to defeat any efficiencies you gain in creating the air in the first place.”As climate change drives regional temperatures higher, and CO2-emitting climate control technologies contribute to the problem, some climate advocates, architects and researchers have begun to ask whether reducing the Gulf’s reliance on mechanical cooling could better help it weatherproof its future. The idea is not far-fetched; it’s rooted in traditions of the past. Yet, in today’s world of fossil-fueled air-conditioned comfort, it can be easy to forget that life was not always this way. Air-conditioner units in Kuwait City. (Shather Naqi/Noema Magazine) Manufactured WeatherBefore modern air conditioning, the Gulf’s locals coexisted with the sun and heat, utilizing local thermal-resistant building materials and architectural and urban design elements that harnessed nature to lower indoor temperatures. During the hotter months, many rested in the afternoons, bathed in the sea or natural springs or retreated to cooler environs.Modern air conditioning is a relatively young technology, dating back just over 100 years to the turn of the 20th century, when it was designed to control humidity in manufacturing facilities. But other methods of cooling the air or reducing humidity indoors date back millennia, and many traditions originate in the arid and semi-arid plains of Central and Southwest Asia and the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa.One archaeological expedition in the early aughts claimed to have found air conditioning at Hamoukar in northeastern Syria near the Iraqi and Turkish borders. There, a team of researchers from the University of Chicago and Syria’s Department of Antiquities and Ministry of Culture unearthed double-walled living quarters buried under soil littered with potsherds dating back as far as the fifth millennium BCE.The roughly 2-inch gap between the exterior and interior walls of the double-walled dwellings would have allowed for insulation and reduced heat transfer into the home, protecting inhabitants from the region’s hot summers. “They had air conditioning systems over 6,000 years ago,” an incredulous Mohamed Maktash, a Syrian archaeologist and co-director of the excavation, told The Independent in June 2000.Other examples of vernacular passive cooling systems are dotted throughout the region’s historical record. Chimney-like towers that harness winds and manipulate indoor air temperatures through downdraft cooling, common in cities in Iran’s central and eastern plains, are believed to date as far back as 2,500 years. When outside temperatures exceed those inside, air that enters the tower through side openings is cooled. Since cool air is denser than warmer air, it sinks down through the tower and is released through vents that open into the building. Protruding windows enclosed with wood latticework that shield interior spaces from sunlight grew popular across Southwest Asia and North Africa during the Ottoman Era. The indoor ledge of the shaded window also offers space for a basin of water to rest and spur evaporative cooling. Countless air-conditioner units whir across the Gulf. (Shather Naqi/Noema Magazine) Unlike the cooling technologies of an earlier era, the purpose of the modern air conditioning that appeared in the Gulf in the 1930s was no longer to channel nature but to command it. American engineer Willis Carrier is credited with inventing that technology at the turn of the century. He later co-founded Carrier Engineering Corporation, which adopted the phrase “manufactured weather” to describe its systems. This phrase reflected not just the potential of air conditioning but also the arrogance of its creators, who fashioned their invention as a replacement, rather than an augmentation, for natural ventilation, historian Gail Cooper wrote in “Air-Conditioning America.” \"Increasingly, the technology that has long facilitated life indoors in the sweltering Gulf states is being deployed to cool the open air.\" Carrier first installed his soon-to-be patented “apparatus for treating air” at Sackett & Wilhelms Lithographing and Printing Company’s printing plant in Brooklyn in 1902. The system worked by blowing air over a set of coils filled with cold water that was later supplemented by a refrigerant (the building, complete with the brick ducts that once distributed cooled air from the basement up to the factory floor, still stands on the corner of Grand Street and Morgan Avenue).The following year, the new building for the New York Stock Exchange opened on 18 Broad Street, becoming the first structure in the world outfitted with modern air conditioning specifically for the comfort of those inside. The building’s cooling system was the brainchild of engineer Alfred R. Wolff, known in the field as an eccentric who refused to speak on the telephone or join the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers.Like its creator, the cooling system installed on Broad Street to keep 1,500 hot-tempered brokers in the block-long building from sweating through their shirts was a curiosity. It was designed to lower the trading floor temperature to 75 degrees Fahrenheit using 11 high-powered fans, four high-pressure boilers, and three 150-ton ammonia-absorption machines — forebears to Qatar’s stadium coolers.It was not until decades later, in the early 1930s, when engineer Henry Galson designed an affordable and compact unit, that the air conditioner burst into home cooling. By the 1950s, tens of thousands of window air conditioners were humming in homes, hotels, restaurants and offices worldwide.When mass-manufactured air conditioners hit the market, they became available for import to the Gulf for the first time. The region’s first customers were British and American oil companies in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, and Western elites in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, who soon had the machines installed in their villas.For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, the British Empire and its officials were the dominant power in the region, exercising control over Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, parts of what is now Saudi Arabia, and today’s UAE. Between the two world wars, American and British oil companies also arrived, intent on commanding the region’s natural resources. But the sweat staining their colonial dress uniforms and Western suits was a constant reminder that the weather was beyond their control.A series of handbooks for British diplomats serving in the Arabian Peninsula between 1885 and 1924 warned of summers that were “exceedingly,” “insupportably” and “intensely” hot. The island of Bahrain and parts of the peninsula’s southern coast, one volume noted, were prone to “violent whirlwinds, from all sides” that felt like “a blast from a furnace” and stirred up so much dust that it was impossible to navigate.Many of Britain’s early descriptions of the Gulf could be interpreted as examples of what historian Diana K. Davis has called “environmental orientalism,” where an environment is narrated as defective and unproductive in relation to Europe’s norms.Colonial commentators also wove racist tropes of the region’s inhabitants into their contemptuous depictions of its climate, signaling their belief that both land and people were strange, backward and in need of Britain’s civilizing influence. Generations of European thinkers exemplified this project of simultaneous environmental and sociocultural othering with the claim that the intense heat and sun of colonial territories in the tropics, North Africa and the Gulf rendered locals idle and less intelligent than Europeans.But what these foreigners failed to recognize was that locals had developed sophisticated means of adapting to the climate over generations. When norms of resting through hot afternoons and migrating to cooler oases during the hotter months clashed with European and American working patterns, they were treated not as a way to cope with the heat but as proof of racist claims about the local population’s laziness.The British also disparaged architectural and urban design elements long used to temper the harshness of the sun. Gulf homes were often built with local thermal-resistant materials, such as coral stones and palm fronds, and arranged around a central open courtyard. The yard provided a shaded and open-air space within the home and promoted air circulation through downdraft cooling similar to Iran’s wind towers. By the 19th century, some in the Gulf had wind-catching towers of their own, as knowledge of the design element had traveled across the Persian Gulf with migrants from southern Iran. \"Some climate advocates, architects and researchers have begun to ask whether reducing the Gulf’s reliance on mechanical cooling could better help it weatherproof its future.\" Towns often had narrow and labyrinthine streets, such that the streets themselves and the buildings that lined them were shaded by one another from the sun. Colonial observers condemned the paths as disorganized and a threat to public health, associating the design with filth, disease and ignorance. One British engineer stationed with the colonial government in Egypt in the 1910s described the style, which he also saw on the streets of Cairo, as “detestable to the engineer of European training.”From 1983 to 1985, British architect John Yarwood lived in Muharraq, an old pearl-diving center and one of Bahrain’s largest cities, where he observed that while the British adopted coral stone as a building material, the homes they constructed with it ignored complementary design traditions. Built with insufficient ventilation and rooms that were much larger than the local norm, the dwellings were left with sagging roofs and damp interiors. Yarwood’s predecessors blamed the stones for their architectural problems.Anthropologist Marwa Koheji, whose forthcoming book documents the adoption of modern air conditioning technologies in Bahrain, writes that the British also lacked the knowledge to care for their coral stone homes, which required regular maintenance to prevent water damage, labor usually carried out by local women.The arrival of air conditioning to the Gulf promised foreign administrators not only relief but also a level of technological control over their natural and built environments that had eluded them for decades.

(Shather Naqi/Noema Magazine) Reengineering The GulfAir conditioning made it possible for those in the Gulf to reproduce certain Western norms — whether it was the oil barons’ stiff Western suits or their furnishings of thick fabric curtains and upholstery — in a region ill-suited to them.When Mark Stott, manager of the British Bank of the Middle East, moved into a new home in Dubai in the early 1950s, he decided there was no need to postpone his housewarming for the arrival of cooler weather. With an air conditioning unit installed in the new home, Stott wagered he could recreate the pleasant atmosphere of an English luncheon even at the height of Dubai’s summer.Stott unveiled his novel appliance as guests filed in on one August afternoon, assuring them that there was no need to open windows or switch on the old ceiling fan to stay cool. Unfortunately, things began to heat up at the meal, and it was later discovered that the air conditioner’s fans had been installed backward. The incident was a relatively minor mishap, and the promise of summer luncheons lived on.By 1953, Peter Doherty, a doctor tasked with advising British diplomats in the Gulf, observed that air conditioning had become “a necessity.” Oil companies expected their employees to work an eight-hour day, six days a week, Doherty noted, but the companies provided air conditioning in their homes and offices. The machines enabled the ceaseless extraction of oil that has since made Qatar and the UAE among the richest nations in the world.This air-conditioned embrace of foreign norms also extended to imported urban and architectural styles, as well as building materials, which became popular in Gulf cities during a post-World War II oil-fueled building boom. The explosion of wealth generated by the burgeoning oil industry required a simultaneous expansion in lodging and amenities to serve an influx of workers and trade infrastructure to get the oil to market. Among those workers were European and American planners, engineers, landscapers and architects, who brought with them design norms better suited to their native countries. These professionals, Sharp told me, were “producing at a rapid pace what they thought was suitable with little regard to the structural and design specifications needed for the local context.”The urbanization of the immediate post-war era was so dramatic that sometimes it seemed as if old cities were being torn up by the roots. One visitor to Doha in 1957 remarked that the town appeared to have suffered an artillery bombardment due to the extensive construction. Architect Christopher Mitchell, who worked at the British firm John R. Harris and Partners in Dubai, which began remaking the architecture of the Gulf in 1952, commented in a talk given at the British Society for Middle Eastern Studies’ annual conference in 1976 that “from every point of view, it is the degree and speed of change which is so remarkable and which is more revolutionary than evolutionary in impact.” \"Air conditioning made it possible for those in the Gulf to reproduce certain Western norms ... in a region ill-suited to them.\" Concrete soon became the foremost building material, supplanting traditional, more thermal-resistant materials like the coral stone long-maligned by colonists. Similarly, many home and urban design principles maximizing shade and ventilation were abandoned. Narrow maze-like paths were replaced by grids of wide streets intersecting at right angles and paved with heat-trapping asphalt. Courtyard homes were phased out in favor of one- or two-story European-style villas, where families gathered in a salon inside their concrete-walled home, rather than the shade of an internal yard. Trees and other flora — as well as gardeners to tend them — were all sourced from abroad, in an effort to recreate the verdant lawns and gardens of Westerners’ faraway homes. The embrace of steel, glass and concrete as building materials has been taken to an extreme in Dubai. There, Emirati developer Emaar marshalled 330,000 cubic meters of concrete, 39,000 metric tons of steel rebar and 142,000 square meters of glass to erect what became the world’s tallest building in 2010. The tip of Emaar’s 163-storey-tall Burj Khalifa towers more than half a mile above Dubai’s streets and sidewalks. It joins a lineup of dozens of other skyscrapers rising at least 300 meters (or nearly 990 feet) in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, making up more than a quarter of the “supertall” and “megatall” buildings worldwide, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat.Air conditioning makes life possible within these mind-bending concrete, steel and glass skyscrapers, all so ill-fitted to the region’s climate as to render them bizarre, noted Sharp: “It’s literally building greenhouses in places of extreme temperatures.”As foreign experts reproduced much of the West’s urban form in the mid-20th-century Gulf, they also replicated colonial and racial hierarchies in the structure of the region’s growing cities. This was epitomized in the segregated enclaves designed and built by oil companies like Ahmadi in Kuwait; Awali in Bahrain; and Dhahran in Saudi Arabia. There, the drawing of color lines was a guiding design principle, and the region’s newest technology was only made available to some. In Ahmadi, the Kuwait Oil Company’s British and American senior staff resided in lush subdivisions of pre-fabricated homes with air-conditioning units, bathrooms, kitchens and separate servants’ quarters. Meanwhile, the company’s other foreign workers, mainly from Egypt, Jordan and Syria, were given fans and housed in Nissen huts or large concrete apartment blocks with detached latrine blocks in an “Arab Village.” Other oil towns sprouted ramshackle labor camps on their peripheries, where the makeshift nature of the homes reinforced perceptions of their residents as unskilled and transient laborers.At every turn, air conditioning enabled the hubris of the men who fashioned themselves the Gulf’s masters. As household incomes rose with oil wealth, many residents bought imported air-conditioned cars to traverse new networks of unshaded roads and air conditioners to cool their concrete homes. Later, when the machines became so popular that their demand for energy began to outstrip local power supplies and cause regular summer shortages, the GCC’s six nations joined their electrical grids in an unprecedented feat of political cooperation and infrastructural engineering.

(Shather Naqi/Noema Magazine) Manufactured CrisisIn 2016, Kuwait’s Mitribah weather station measured one of the world’s highest-ever recorded temperatures, equaling the 129.2 degrees Fahrenheit measured by the aptly named Furnace Creek Ranch weather station in Death Valley, Calif., three years earlier. But while the population of Death Valley is in the hundreds, Mitribah lies just north of Kuwait City, which is home to 3.4 million people. In April, temperatures in Kuwait once again rose to near world-record-breaking triple digits — this time amid power cuts across the country. “There’s not enough supply, and people are abusing the hell out of their air conditioning systems,” said Mariam AlSaad, founder and director of AlManakh, one of Kuwait’s only environmental advocacy organizations. The region’s knitted-together power grid has begun to strain, as the machines that have chilled Gulf cities for almost a century put increasing pressure on its energy supplies.Summer temperatures of over 120 degrees Fahrenheit are no longer news in the Gulf. Research suggests that by 2050, even in what the research group Climate Action Tracker calculates is an optimistic scenario, Gulf nations will likely experience as many as 250 dangerous heat days annually, with temperatures and the relative humidity exceeding 103 degrees Fahrenheit. Extreme temperatures and sea level rise threaten the already scarce groundwater in the region, exacerbating the gap between freshwater supplies and demand. One 2015 report in “Nature Climate Change” projected the region could “exceed a threshold for human adaptability” by the end of the century. \"At every turn, air conditioning enabled the hubris of the men who fashioned themselves the Gulf’s masters.\" The climate crisis has arrived in the Gulf, driven in no small part by the mid-20th-century remaking of the region’s cities and relationship to the natural world. Today, annual per capita water use in the region is 560 liters, or 148 gallons, daily, compared to a global average of 180 liters, or 48 gallons, daily. As water supplies dwindle, the UAE has turned to desalinated water to care for the imported grasses, wildflowers and other non-native plants that dot its cities and line its highway medians. Meanwhile, Qatar and Bahrain have the highest per capita CO2 emissions in the world, and the other four GCC nations are among the top eight.Air conditioning accounts for up to 70% of household electricity use in the Gulf, and across the Middle East, the amount of energy used to cool spaces increased fivefold from 1990 to 2016, according to the World Bank. Air conditioners run almost non-stop — an estimated 250 days or more per year in households and daily in most commercial and office buildings — to shield residents from the region’s scorching temperatures. The constant hum of machines and brush of chilled air have become as much a part of everyday life in the Gulf as the dust that settles on sidewalks and parked cars.During her research in Bahrain, some told Koheji that they prefer their homes to be cool enough to wear sweaters and sleep under quilts year-round. One woman admitted to sometimes using a portable heater to keep from freezing at work. “Low temperatures have become status symbols in the Arabian Peninsula,” said Gökçe Günel, a professor of anthropology at Rice University, who studies clean technology infrastructure in the Gulf.Recent investments in renewables include Qatar’s World Cup solar farm, two more solar plants inaugurated in the nation earlier this year and one of the world’s largest single-site solar parks — stretching across an area greater than that of Manhattan — in the UAE that is expected to be fully operational by 2030. Saudi Arabia and the UAE’s rush to grab land across Africa for carbon offsetting projects has garnered the nickname “The New Scramble for Africa” among environmental advocates and Western media.But these efforts have drawn criticism for their power to greenwash, rather than reduce emissions. To critics, Gulf nations seem less interested in a true transition away from fossil fuels than they are in laundering their petrodollars and reputations, while maintaining their positions at the center of the global energy regime. Indeed, the region’s governments appear committed to expanding oil production as long as there is demand. Or, as Abdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabian Minister of Energy and member of the royal family, vowed back in 2021, “every molecule of hydrocarbon will come out.”For Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE — all particularly concerned with their international reputations — participating in the popular discourse of environmentalism has translated into power on the world stage. During COP28, the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, host city Dubai dazzled attendees with images of its planned investments in renewables. Meanwhile, COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, who heads the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, allegedly leveraged his position to pursue close to $100 billion in oil and gas deals on the side. “Low temperatures have become status symbols in the Arabian Peninsula.\" — Gökçe Günel The investments in renewables also serve a purpose at home, where the region’s rulers are facing diminishing faith in their power to stave off the effects of global warming and ensure the uninterrupted flow of subsidized fuel, electricity and water that their subjects have come to expect. One 2017 public opinion survey on climate change in the GCC nations found that 80% of respondents feared the current approach to economic development in the region was unsustainable. That’s a problem because “being able to secure consumption amongst your population is how you secure legitimacy,” Christian Henderson, a lecturer at the Netherlands’ Leiden University, told me. Henderson’s research concerns the political ecology of the Middle East. The Gulf’s delicate social contract, which has kept royal families in power since the end of the colonial era, is under threat as the globe teeters on the brink of climate disaster.

Right: A house under construction using concrete as its main building material in Kuwait. (Shather Naqi/Noema Magazine) A Manufactured Future?As the Gulf warms, some local architects are drawing inspiration from the past to prepare for the future. Over the past few decades, the courtyard homes of the pre-British period and the insulated walls that originated millennia ago have made a limited comeback. Some designers have begun experimenting with positioning buildings to maximize shade and foregoing glass in sun-facing facades.In Salmiya, not far from Kuwait City, AGi Architects, a firm with offices in Spain and Kuwait, built a 21st-century wind tower in 2017. The striking 12-unit apartment block’s hollow center offers the benefits of shaded courtyards on a vertical scale, while an indoor-outdoor pool on the first floor lowers the temperature of air entering the building before it flows upward and cools internal terraces. Located on the south side of the granite-faced tower, the stairs and elevators insulate the building’s residential quarters from the sun. Typically, families resting on their terraces enjoy temperatures more than 14 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than those outside — without mechanical cooling.Other architects like Noorihan Abdulmageed are pursuing new methods, such as building homes 5 to 10 meters (or roughly 16 to 32 feet) underground with sunken courtyards that use the Earth as a natural cooling agent. Abdulmageed used local weather and climate data to determine that building at that depth could reduce the heat inside homes by up to 13 degrees Fahrenheit. Other thoughtful design choices, such as locating the heat-producing kitchen and laundry room along an outermost wall on an underground level and incorporating natural ventilation, could reduce the number of months mechanical cooling is needed annually by at least half, according to the architect’s calculations. For now, her homes exist only as two prototypes designed and tested in Bahrain.A wider adoption of sustainable building practices like these will require letting go of foreign professional standards that experts argue are not sensitive to the region’s needs but are still in fashion. Local engineers continue to use cooling standards from the American Society for Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers, while architects refer to green certification systems developed by the U.S. Green Building Council or Britain’s Building Research Establishment.Saudi Arabia and the UAE have tried developing standards of their own. But the efforts remain underfunded and underappreciated, Sharp said: “If they would put as much attention into developing their own frameworks as they do [into] building the highest skyscraper, then the region would be in a much better place.”Recently, Sharp and colleagues argued in a paper that achieving more “climate-just” cities in the Gulf requires investing in pragmatic interventions, such as developing building standards or even something as simple as installing bus shelters along transport routes. Instead, Gulf rulers have turned to futuristic megaprojects promising limitless supplies of energy, water and air-conditioned comfort.The most famous among these is Saudi Arabia’s Neom, in northwestern Tabuk Province at the northern tip of the Red Sea. The $500-billion so-called gigaproject was announced in 2017 as part of the nation’s Vision 2030 development plan. At 26,500 square kilometers, or more than 10,200 square miles, it is larger than Bahrain, Kuwait as well as Qatar, and includes over a dozen planned regions with high-end amenities and housing for over nine million people. An island resort destination with a yacht club, golf course, and 86-berth marina, called Sindalah, became the first of Neom’s planned developments to open in October 2024. Another of Neom’s planned regions, a mountain resort dubbed Trojena, is set to host the Asian Winter Games in 2029, welcoming skiers and parka-clad spectators to its artificial slopes in the desert. An illustrated view of the gigaproject Sindalah Island via Wikimedia/Salman Al-Mazini. Developers have promised that Neom will run on renewables and that one of its cities, called The Line — comprising a pair of 500-meter-tall glass-faced skyscrapers stretching over 170 kilometers (or nearly 106 miles) through the desert — will be car-free and carbon-neutral. But to fund what is supposed to be a green project, Saudi Arabia is relying on continued oil revenues, drawing criticism for creating what journalist Lyse Mauvais called “a global showroom of false climate solutions” in an article on climate disinformation for Germany’s Heinrich Böll Stiftung. \"Gulf rulers have turned to futuristic megaprojects promising limitless supplies of energy, water and air-conditioned comfort.\" A decade before Saudi Arabia began to sell the world on Neom, Abu Dhabi announced a car-free, zero-carbon metropolis meant to welcome about 50,000 residents and as many as 60,000 commuters who would move between high-tech office blocks on a 100-station public transportation system. Called Masdar City, the project was met with a buzz of excitement and fawning coverage. But after breaking ground in 2008, the global economic slowdown and shifting government priorities meant development sputtered out before most plans could be realized.Today, Masdar City feels like a ghost town. Students enrolled at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, part of the development completed before construction stalled, trudge across plots of desert land and past unfinished office buildings to get to class. The city never succeeded in zeroing out its fossil fuel emissions. Critics eye Neom, wondering if it will meet the same fate. Masdar City under construction in January 2012. (Photo via Wikimedia/Jan Seifert) The StakesThe air-conditioned environments of Masdar City and The Line are supposed utopian oases set against “Mad Max”-like images of a dystopian near future of extreme heat and drought beyond their walls. “These cosmopolitan experts coming together inside these hubs is one imagination,” Günel told me when I asked her about the projects. “But what’s happening outside these spaces, you have this vision of landscapes devastated by climate change.”The other side of the 21st-century Gulf is manifested in neighborhoods like Jleeb al-Shuyoukh, one of the most congested areas in Kuwait City, where migrant laborers reside in informal shelters with few protections from the searing heat and increasingly common extreme weather events, such as flash floods and dust storms. Many of the migrants who live here, and in neighborhoods like it across the GCC nations, are from poorer parts of the Arab world, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Africa. They immigrate with hopes of earning a sliver of Gulf oil wealth but often find themselves on the front lines of the climate crisis instead, as they labor on precarious contracts in the region’s construction, manufacturing or service industries.Traveling through Jleeb al-Shuyoukh in 2023, AlSaad said she saw the carcasses of stray dogs that had succumbed to the heat scattered among housing that resembled “a bombed-out village.” Working environments for many of the region’s migrant laborers are no better, and labor and immigration laws in Kuwait and across the GCC nations preclude many from exercising their most basic rights, including accessing healthcare, changing jobs, driving a vehicle or migrating with their families.Rather than shedding the hierarchies etched in the urban landscape with the steel and concrete of the Gulf’s mid-20th-century transformation, the region’s rulers have allowed the segregated labor camps of colonial oil towns to be transfigured into ever-expanding slums on the outskirts of their gleaming cityscapes. Today, the Gulf is the world’s most unequal region, according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research.The juxtaposition of wealth and death is most stark among the region’s megaprojects, where the bodies of migrant workers are marshaled as if they are raw material for construction work. More than 21,000 migrant workers, primarily from India, Bangladesh and Nepal, are believed to have died working on Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 development projects since 2017, according to a documentary investigation by British broadcaster ITV.More than 6,500 workers from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka died making Qatar’s 2022 World Cup dream come true, according to the Guardian. Human Rights Watch has warned that the upcoming World Cup in Saudi Arabia could cost thousands more lives. Regionwide, as many as 10,000 migrant workers reportedly die annually due to overwork, abuse and extreme heat. Those who survive experience a slew of harmful health conditions, including cardiovascular, respiratory and kidney diseases, as well as diabetes and stress-related mental health conditions. \"Air conditioning has made today’s life, this life, possible in the Gulf. But ... might there be a way to make a new and different Gulf world?\" Those invited to inhabit the region’s hypermodern safe havens are expected to make a different sort of sacrifice. Günel, who detailed the development of Abu Dhabi’s Masdar City in “Spaceship in the Desert,” found that experts charged with administering the space often positioned the achievement of a green future opposite the promise of personal freedoms and equality. She called this impulse one of “technocratic dictatorship,” wherein scientists and engineers promised to protect an in-group from existential threats as long as they give up certain rights. “It was almost like a compromise had to be made in order to have these utopian spaces exist within these dystopian landscapes,” Günel told me. “That compromise was the possibility of collective decision-making or any kind of democratic norms.”Air conditioning has made today’s life, this life, possible in the Gulf. But some have begun to question whether the cost and its vision are worth the tradeoffs — might there be a way to make a new and different Gulf world?Creating a world that is less unequal and better prepared for the challenges of climate change will require balancing mechanical cooling with a re-embrace of millennia-old knowledge about life in the region and recognizing air conditioning technologies for what they have long represented: A tool for those who seek to divide and rule over both man and nature.Nour Alsabagh contributed research to this story.

      "content": "This week marks the one-year anniversary of Gisnep, the daily puzzle I made initially just because I liked the name. So I thought I’d reflect on how it’s been doing, what’s happened with it over the past year, and what I plan for the future of Gisnep.A Quick RecapGisnep is a daily game in the style known as “dropquote” or “quotefall” puzzles. Solving the puzzle each day reveals a quote – sometimes profound, or funny, or odd. I added a little twist to the traditional format, making the source of the quote something that is revealed as you solve the puzzle and can provide additional clues if you figure out the source early on.Before I even thought of making a game, I had registered the domain name on a whim without knowing what I would do with it, and then gradually developed the game over a couple months. I discarded an earlier version that I decided was a bit too tedious to play. I am not much of a programmer, so I vibe coded the game before “vibe coding” was a term. You can read the whole story of how I built it in last year’s launch announcement.Added FeaturesInitially, once it was out in the world, I had a lot of bug reports that I was squashing quickly. But I also began to get a lot of feature requests. I added a “settings” widget for some of the popular requests, like hiding the timer since some people found it stressful. I also added a toggle to highlight the current word you’re at, to help people understand how words wrap to the next line.My typical settings when I playI also decided that when you solve the puzzle, it would be nice to learn something about the source of the quote. So after a puzzle is solved you now get a “Who is that?” link to learn more about the quote source. I hear from people that they love this, and that they learn about interesting people from those links.The link is automatically generated to go to the top Wikipedia entry for that person’s name. It’s a bit of a gamble that it will be the right person, and sometimes it fails hilariously. Like, the link for the poet Mary Richards went instead to the entry for the fictional character Mary Richards, played by Mary Tyler Moore. I finally updated the backend to allow me to override the default link so I could fix issues like that.I also added some little features that I don’t explicitly mention anywhere. Like, if you switch to another tab, the timer on Gisnep pauses until you come back to it. That’s one way to pause the game if you need to get up for anything. Maybe I should actually mention that somewhere.But the number one feature request people kept asking for was the ability to play old games. That was great to hear! People really enjoyed the game and wanted more of it. Someone on reddit even dug through the source code to figure out how to hack the game and let him play future puzzles, and shared a convoluted method that other players could use, too. So I prioritized adding an archive that would keep track of which games you still hadn’t played.Green means in-progress. Gray means completed. Black means unstartedLast month, a new bug surfaced that only affected people who had solved every single puzzle so far. I was pleased to hear from so many people reporting the bug. That meant that a lot of people have played every single puzzle.I Added An Easter EggWhen I added the archive, each puzzle needed a unique URL. I settled on giving each puzzle a unique number (as opposed to using the date), and formatted the links like this example: https://gisnep.com/?game=338.But then I thought of that guy on reddit who figured out how to play future puzzles. Surely, this would make it even easier for people to do that. They’d just keep increasing the number to play all the upcoming games. I needed to defend against that. I could just have a 404 page saying that no such page exists when people try to play future games, but I thought it would be more fun to have a surprise for someone who tries to play a game that hasn’t been released yet.So I made a special game that only appears if you attempt to play an unreleased puzzle. I don’t keep a log of whether or not that game has been played, so I only know of one person for sure who has found it.And now I guess you can find it, too. I know, it’s a bit of a spoiler to tell you about it, but it’s actually not the only Gisnep easter egg so I haven’t ruined every surprise. Shhhh.I Tried Ads But Hated ThemWhen I added the archive, I planned to put ads on the game. I figured that the current day’s game would always be ad-free, but games from the archive would have ads. That seemed like a fair way to monetize.I implemented it for private testing, and I hated it. Ads are just so ugly. I couldn’t stand to have them on the site, even if just in the archives, and even if just at the bottom of the page.One placement of ads that I experimented withI imagine that in order to make really good money on ads, you need to have significantly more visitors than I have, and probably more obnoxiously placed ads, and it didn’t seem worthwhile to ruin the experience for everyone in order to make a couple bucks. So I never rolled that out.I have always had a tiny link on the bottom of each page that says “Leave a tip” and a surprising number of people actually do. I could imagine that if people saw me monetizing already with ads, they would be less inclined to make a donation. Since I don’t think I would have made that much money with ads, not having them has probably been the more lucrative choice anyway – and a much better user experience.Some NumbersSo how many people actually play Gisnep? Not as many as I’d like.On the busiest day, 3,544 people played Gisnep. That was just a few weeks after launch, when Tom Scott mentioned Gisnep in his newsletter. I’ve had a couple similar peaks, but more typically I have 1,300 to 1,500 daily visitors.One year of trafficBut that’s nothing to turn up my nose at. About 1,400 people return to Gisnep every day to play. And that number of regular players has remained fairly steady with just a little bit of gradual drop-off as you can see in the chart above. Overall, I think it’s pretty good.And on average, 50% of visitors play 2 games per visit, so the archive is definitely getting used. That’s just an average, of course. I can see from my logs that some people are playing a lot of games per visit and spending a lot of time on the site, and some people just play today’s game and leave.But is this enough to call Gisnep a success? I mean, if it didn’t require any upkeep and was completely set-and-forget, I’d be happy with even one visitor per day. But for the (admittedly small) amount of work it requires to maintain, I wish more people were playing it.Some people post their daily scores on social media, and for a while there was someone playing every day on TikTok. But those people don’t have large audiences themselves, so they haven’t translated into very many new players. Growth hasn’t been viral, but people who play it seem to enjoy it enough that I have a lot of regulars. I’m running out of ideas for how to spread the word further without spending money on advertising. I’m open to suggestions.The Mobile IssueOne thing I know would likely increase players is if it was easier to play on mobile, like other popular daily games. Right now, it’s functional on mobile, and people play it that way, but it’s not the best experience. Still, mobile users make up about 40% of the daily visits – and that percentage is a bit higher during the weekend – so I wish it were better for them.The problem is that when I designed the game, I decided that 20 boxes across is the optimum number for gameplay. But that means they’re small little squares on mobile, hard to read or target with your finger on a phone.I could do fewer squares across on mobile so that they can be bigger, but then the quote has to be really short so it doesn’t wrap on too many lines. And at that point, it’s a bit too easy to solve.I considered making a “Gisnep Mini” version just for mobile. But it seemed like it would be too easy and it wouldn’t be fun – plus then I’d need to come up with twice as many puzzles each day. And when someone completes the Mini version on mobile, they still might want to play the harder version on mobile as a follow-up anyway. So I’ve resigned myself to this just being a game that’s better on desktop but still playable on mobile. For now, anyway.I added some extra functionality in the mobile version to hopefully make it a little more playable. I have no idea whether people on mobile use this feature.The Upkeep ChallengeI mentioned above that Gisnep still requires a little upkeep. That’s mainly in two areas:First, the game has a different tagline every day. I thought this would give the game a bit of personality, but wow is it hard coming up with original taglines for every day that aren’t extremely lame. I use ChatGPT to help, but discard most of its suggestions.The taglines are mostly selected randomly but I do sometimes peg specific taglines to specific days. Sometimes the connection is obvious (a joke about a movie coming out that week, or a holiday, or other notable event), but sometimes it’s more obscure and written just to amuse myself.Every few months, I come up with a new batch of taglines for the next few months, manually edit the json, and upload to the server via FTP. It’s not the worst thing in the world as far as upkeep goes, but it’s a bit of mental overhead to even remember to do it.If I ever run out of taglines, it’s currently programmed to just reuse them from the beginning. Would anyone even notice? Each time I add more, I wonder if it’s worth it or if I should just have one persistent tagline, or no tagline at all.Or maybe I should lean into it even more, and make taglines connected to current events more often.Actually, hang on a second... [vibe-coding]. Okay, I just built a web interface for myself to manage the taglines. It’s hopefully going to be less friction than manually editing a json and uploading it via FTP, and encourage me to write more timely taglines more often. We’ll see.I can’t believe that I vibe-coded this in an hour, maybe a little longer with testing and troubleshooting. It’s not the prettiest thing ever, but it doesn’t have to be. It’s fully functional and also let’s me edit the “regular” taglines list, reorder them, and so on. And most importantly, if I type a word with a straight apostrophe, it converts it to curly. Never forget to include that in your interfaces.The other bit of upkeep is the puzzles themselves. I can’t just pull random quotes from a quote database. They have to meet certain criteria for Gisnep: not too short; not too long; no more than once sentence; and they have to make sense without punctuation.I’ve got some scripts that go through various free databases and pull quotes that meet those qualifications. Then I have to go through and remove the ones that are problematic (a surprising number of quotes in public databases are homophobic statements from politicians). And then I have to check for spelling issues, etc.I do this in much larger batches than the taglines, so I actually don’t need to touch the quote database for another year or so, although I do add new ones occasionally when I think of them, or when people send me good quote suggestions.And just like the taglines, I have the ability to schedule certain quotes for certain days, which I sometimes do, although I don’t know if people notice.Amusingly, I sometimes get accused of scheduling certain quotes to reflect current events that were actually just coincidentally relevant.The Future of GisnepAs long as I still have a huge batch of upcoming quotes in the database, I see no reason not to keep Gisnep going. It would work fine without touching it for the next six months, but I have a couple more years’ worth of quotes ready to add to the database. If I gave up on anything, it would be taglines. I’d probably just turn taglines off completely if I didn’t want to maintain them anymore.There’s also the question of the moose at the top of the game. His name is Mickey Moose. I never meant there to be a permanent moose. I have no idea if people like or hate the moose. I suspect most people are indifferent. I’ll probably keep him around for now.The worst thing that could happen is if a new bug pops up that breaks functionality. Since launching Gisnep, I’ve started a new full time gig (I’ll tell you more about that some other time) so my available time to troubleshoot or add new features is less than it used to be.What I really need is for some big famous celebrity like Sydney Sweeney Ryan Reynolds to post all over social media how much they love playing Gisnep. Then maybe I can reach the critical mass of players required to sell Gisnep to the New York Times for a bajillion dollars.So if you’ve enjoyed playing Gisnep this year, the best gift you could give is to tell a friend. Or Ryan Reynolds. Or your friend Ryan Reynolds.And that brings us to the end of another newsletter! It was a bit more naval-gazing than usual, but hopefully you found it interesting. If you didn’t, and somehow made it this far, then I’m surprised but also thankful.Oh, one other small thing about Gisnep. I’ve seen occasional conversations where people wonder how it’s pronounced. Hard G or Soft G? I can’t believe I’ve accidentally made a product with a GIF-like debate. One thing I know from the GIF discussion is that it doesn’t matter what the creator intends, people will do whatever they want and swear it’s correct. But for the record, I say Gisnep with a hard G. And GIF with a soft G like the creator intended.Thanks as always for reading. See you next time!David",

      "content": "1 Introduction Science often discovers surprising things. Who would have thought that your great^30-billion grandfather was a prokaryote? So does philosophy. Any particular example of something that philosophers have discovered will be controversial, but I think pretty undeniable examples of discovered philosophical truths are that avoiding the repugnant conclusion is surprisingly tricky, worlds with infinite happy and miserable people are mostly incomparable, and every way of making decisions about low probabilities requires giving up some obvious-seeming principle. Many philosophical judgments are surprising at first, but turn out to be nearly unavoidable. Here's one of them: sparing infinite shrimp from extreme torture is vastly better than saving one human from death. This is a surprising judgment, but I think it's supported by pretty irrefutable philosophical argument. Friend of the blog recently kicked up a huge firestorm by arguing for this, and unsurprisingly, I think she is right. Now, there's some uncertainty about whether shrimp are actually conscious. So here I will argue that given our uncertainty about shrimp consciousness, we should save some number of shrimp from torture over one human. If shrimp aren't conscious, then in fact saving shrimp over people won't turn out for the best, but I claim that given our uncertainty in the matter, it's expectationally worth it. 2 Life extension I have bad news: no life has ever been saved! Destruction of life is never really averted, merely delayed. Lives aren't saved, they're merely extended. What we colloquially refer to as saving a life merely means preventing someone from dying of one particular cause, so their life is lengthened until they eventually succumb to something else. If someone's life is saved when they're 40, and then they eventually die at the age of 80, then really all we've done is extend their life by 40 years. Okay, with that out of the way, let me appeal to the following obvious principle: It is better to prevent Graham's number shrimp from being tortured than to extend a person's life by a single millisecond. Graham's number is an astronomically large number—far too big to ever write down in the observable universe even if you wrote down each digit on a single atom.1 It's a lot more than 100!The principle says that if you can either prevent that many shrimp from being tortured—so that you avert vastly more suffering than has existed in human history—that would be better than extending one person's life by one millisecond. This premise seems extremely obvious! Now, imagine that there is some person who is currently 40. There are 1,577,847,600,000 keyboards in front of you (conveniently, the number of milliseconds in 50 years, what a coincidence). Each of them has two buttons, one labeled \"shrimp\" and the other is labeled \"life extension.\" For each keyboard, if you press \"shrimp\" then you spare Graham's number shrimp from extreme torture. If you press \"human,\" then you add an extra millisecond to the person's life. Note: each keyboard functions independently. Clearly, it's better to press the shrimp button than the life extension button. This follows from the earlier principle: it's better to save Graham's number shrimp from torture than to extend a person's life by one millisecond. No matter how many other buttons you've pressed of each kind, it's better to press the button that spares Graham's number shrimp than the button that adds an extra millisecond to life! Thus, you should press every shrimp button and none of the life extension buttons. But if you do that, rather than saving a person's life (i.e. extending it by 50 years), you'll spare 1,577,847,600,000*Graham's number shrimp from extreme torture! Thus, saving some number of shrimp is much better than saving one person's life! This argument strikes me as decisive! 3 Flo's argument In her piece, presents another argument which I'll present in slightly abridged form. Imagine that you were an immortal being. Every 100 years, you could go on a five-minute drive to a nearby store with a button: if pressed, the button would spare 10^100 shrimp from extreme torture. Seems like quite a good idea! But here's the catch: people sometimes get into car accidents. If you are an immortal being, even if you are an extremely good driver, at some point, you will get into a car accident that kills someone. Now, by that time you'll probably have saved a very large number of shrimp from torture (the odds per drive that you'll kill someone are quite low!) But if human lives are infinitely more ethically significant than shrimp lives, then driving for five minutes every 100 years to save 10^100 shrimp would be morally wrong; it would predictably cost a human life and save shrimp. Thus, to think that a human life matters infinitely more than shrimp, you have to think it would be wrong to drive for five minutes to save 10^100 shrimp from extreme torture. That's obviously wrong! 4 Love on the spectrum The theory of evolution implies that we evolved from creatures that were relatively like shrimp, at least with respect to their moral importance. Your great^10 billion grandfather was a creature with about the moral importance of a shrimp. Now, here is a very plausible principle: There is no organism in any generation between us and shrimp-like creatures for which sparing one from torture is more important than sparing any number of the previous generation's members from torture.For example, it isn't true that it's better to spare one person from the current generation from torture than to spare infinite people from our parent's generation from torture. Nor is it true that sparing one person from our parent's generation is better than sparing infinite people from our grandparent's generation. Now, there's one more controversial premise called the transitivity of the better than relation. This is simply the idea that if A is better than B, and B is better than C, then A is better than C. It's supported by many powerful arguments, and also it seems pretty obvious on its face. These premises collectively imply that saving infinite shrimp from torture is better than saving one human from torture. To simplify, let's call our current generation generation one, the generation before generation two, the generation before that generation three, and so on. Assume that the shrimp creatures were generation 1 billion. Saving one person from torture in generation one is less valuable than saving, say, 1,000 people in generation two. For each of those 1,000 in generation two, saving 1,000 in generation three is more valuable (which is to say, saving 1 million in generation three is more valuable). For each of those 1 million in generation 3, saving 1,000 in generation four is more valuable. You can see where I'm going with this! If you extrapolate this to 1 billion, you end up with the conclusion that saving some number of shrimp-like creatures (members of generation 1 billion) from torture is better than saving one person from torture. If saving one person in generation N less is valuable than saving some number of people in generation N+1, then saving a sufficiently large number in any previous generation is more valuable than saving one in the current generation. Because very distant generations contain shrimp-like creatures, saving some number of shrimp from torture is more important than saving one person from torture. You might worry that this generalizes to bacteria, but bacteria aren't conscious. There was a first conscious organism, and that organism mattered infinitely more than the one before. 5 Moral risk The ethics of moral risk is notoriously fraught! It's unclear how to make decisions under ethical uncertainty, particularly when the units of value across different ethical theories aren't really comparable. But there's a pretty plausible principle: If some action might, on some plausible ethical theory, be the best thing that anyone ever did by infinite orders of magnitude, you have a very strong reason to perform the action—vastly stronger than your reasons to perform an action that's only somewhat good on other theories. For example, if I have non-trivial credence in utilitarianism, and some action is infinitely good according to utilitarianism, then I should regard that action as being vastly better than actions that are just pretty good on other theories—e.g. an action that saves a single person. But on any view according to which welfare matters, saving infinite shrimp from torture is the best thing anyone ever did by infinite orders of magnitude, so given uncertainty, it seems there are strong reasons to perform it. 6 The Huemer argument (For the paper presenting this in a different context, see 's paper here, and his blog post here). Suppose you think it's better to prevent one person from dying than to spare any number of shrimp from torture. Presumably it's better to save some number of shrimp than to have a very low chance of saving a person from dying—saving 10^100 shrimp is better than reducing a person's risk of dying one second from now by one googolth. Thus, there must be some critical probability threshold X, such that an X percent chance of saving a life is better than saving any number of shrimp. For instance, maybe X is 10%, so a 10% chance of saving a person is more valuable than saving any number of shrimp, but saving infinite shrimp is better than a 5% chance of saving a life. Here's the problem: this view violates the following plausible constraint on rationality. Suppose you should perform action A, and then you should perform action B after performing action A. Then you should perform actions A and B together. But now suppose that action A saves googol shrimp rather than reducing a person's risk of death by 8%. Action B also saves googol shrimp rather than reducing a person's risk of death by 8%. Each individual action is worth taking, since they're both below the 10% threshold. But together the actions incur a more than 10% risk of death to save 2*googol shrimp. Thus, together the actions would be impermissible, even though both actions would individually be right. Now, you could hold that actions A and B both stop being permissible if you'll have the option to take the other one—so you should only take action A if you won't later be able to take action B. But this is very odd. Why would the value of saving a bunch of shrimp vs reducing someone's risk of death have anything at all to do with whether you will later, at some other time, save a totally separate bunch of shrimp or reduce the risk of death of someone totally different. We could imagine actions A and B being spaced millions of years apart—in such a scenario, it seems utterly bizarre that they'd affect the worthwhileness of the other. Now, you could just bite the bullet and hold that it's never worth risking human life to save any number of shrimp, but this would imply that you shouldn't drive for one minute to save infinite shrimp, because this would impose a tiny risk to other people. That's pretty crazy! Thus, you're either committed to: Thinking that you shouldn't drive for a minute to save infinite shrimp from excruciating torture. Thinking that whether actions that save shrimp rather than reducing people's risk of death are worth performing has to do with other, totally unrelated actions that affect completely different people and shrimp. Thinking that sometimes each of two actions is right to do, but performing them jointly is wrong. But even that's not quite enough, because if you think each individual action is worth taking, then you'll inevitably think that one should perform a sequence of actions that imposes risks on people above the critical threshold to save a bunch of shrimp. 7 This isn't actually such a weird result!So far I've given arguments that strike me as extremely strong. But you might think that the conclusion is just so weird that you shouldn't accept it. I'll try to disabuse you of this here! I think this conclusion isn't so surprising or revisionary. I know I've said these things many times, but extreme suffering is bad! It's bad to be in lots of pain. Preventing an infinite amount of something very bad is infinitely good. So sparing infinite shrimp from intense pain is infinitely good. And it's better to do something infinitely good than to save a human life. Every plausible view will hold that well-being and suffering are among the things in the world that matter. So when astronomical quantities of suffering are on the line, they ought to provide overriding considerations. There are also good reasons not to trust our direct intuitions on this matter. People just don't have very good intuitions about infinitely big numbers! People will pay nearly the same amount to save 2,000, 20,000, and 200,000 birds. If our intuitions aren't even sensitive to the difference between 2,000 and 200,000, why in the world would we trust them when it comes to literally infinite quantities? Certainly our intuitions don't closely track value—we don't intuitively grok that sparing infinite shrimp is infinity times better than sparing a million shrimp. And, as I've argued at length elsewhere, there are reasons to distrust our direct intuitions about shrimp because they're unsympathetic and weird-looking! Certainly behind the veil of ignorance, we'd prioritize the interests of infinite shrimp over one person. So on the one side we have a single intuition that's untrustworthy many times over, and on the other, we have many different extremely obvious intuitions. I know which one I'm going with! Now, a person might object that if it's a conflict between thinking that shrimp matter at all or that infinite shrimp matter more than saving a person, they'd rather give up the premise that shrimp matter at all. But I don't think this is reasonable. First of all, the arguments above were mostly reasons to think shrimp mattered—only some took shrimp mattering at least a tiny amount for granted, and then argued that they had great aggregate weight. Second, as already discussed, you shouldn't trust your direct intuitions on this matter. Third—and most importantly—the arguments I gave generalize to other cases. Similar arguments establish that preventing infinite headaches is better than preventing a single death (in the arguments above, just replace \"spare shrimp from torture,\" with \"spare people from headaches,\" and change around the spectrum in argument four. Really the deeper problem is with the idea that no number of small harms aggregate to a big harm, and you can't save that idea just by not caring about shrimp! Just as it would be silly to conclude that headaches don't matter at all to avoid the result that some number of headaches are worse than a death, the analogous reasoning with respect to shrimp is similarly in error. 8 So... I think the arguments that infinite shrimp matter more than a single person are pretty decisive! Sparing enough shrimp really is better than sparing one human. Now, it turns out that in practice, for five thousand dollars, you can save about 75 million shrimp from an agonizing torture. I don't know exactly how many shrimp being tortured is as bad as one human dying, but it's probably less than 75 million! So if you bought the arguments I've given, I'd encourage you to give some money to the shrimp welfare project! 1Graham's number was discovered to be the upper bound value of the solution to some problem, which turned out to be between 6 and Graham's number! This didn't narrow it down much! :)",

No scientific instrument epitomizes the spirit of that complex and historiographically dubious process more fully than the air pump (again here we may reference Shapin, this time accompanied by Schaffer). And no work of art conveys the power, danger, and fascination of the air pump more vividly than Joseph Wright of Derby's An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump (1768), currently on display at the National Gallery in London. Much experimental natural philosophy of the early modern period cut across the disciplinary boundaries that took shape over the following centuries and that today we often take for granted. The research program that proceeded under the banner of \"optics\", for example, was as concerned with the anatomy of the eye as it was with the physics of light. The microscope, too, which surely epitomizes the spirit of the age no less than the air pump, was concerned in roughly equal proportions with the theoretical bases of magnification and with enumerating the ingredients from which toe jam is made (to cite a lovely example from the letters of Antoni van Leeuwenhoek). In the case of the air pump, we likewise find a striking combination of physics and physiology (two obviously related terms whose separate fields of concern were in any case still in the course of being worked out). It was an instrument that held out the promise of resolving both fundamental questions about the existence of a physical vacuum — though Robert Boyle consistently denied it could really be of much help in solving all those questions from medieval philosophy that Edward Grant would memorably describe as \"much ado about nothing\". But it was at the same time an instrument that had quite a bit to tell us about, for example, avian pulmonary anatomy.But far more than the microscope, the air pump was also an instrument practically custom-made to attract gawkers. Whatever transpired, or expired, within its exhausted chamber could be simultaneously watched by multiple spectators. Thus, much like the human cadaver dissected in the theatrum anatomicum, the air pump held out a new possibility for naughty delectation — for stern men to insist that the scenes on display beneath the glass were but instances of knowledge advancing, and therefore of no moral concern; and for children to look on in wonder and fear, struggling to take these stern men at their word, while knowing inwardly that a sacrifice to science is still a sacrifice. Unfolding somewhere at the intersection between the aesthetic, the ritual, and the properly experimental, air-pump experiments were at once an occasion of fascination and revulsion, of hopefulness and dread.No one has visually captured the complexity of this cultural practice more powerfully than Joseph Wright. Can Eskinazi adds another dimension, taking this visual lesson in the history of science and rendering it into cinema. It's paradoxical cinema, such as we've known to exist at least since Chris Marker, to the extent that its subjects are not, strictly speaking, in motion. But somehow their enduring stillness, when combined with sound and with the visual storytelling of the camera, hardly seems to matter. On the contrary the scene depicted seems to be positively filled with life (and death).Can Eskinazi, born in İzmir in 1986, is a filmmaker based in İstanbul. He has made documentaries, music videos, and at least a few short and medium-length films. He has begun to experiment with vertical-format film, using this genre to create work at the intersection between the narrative and the didactic, inspired by Roberto Rossellini's TV miniseries on historical subjects such as Socrates (1971) and Blaise Pascal (1972).Directed by Can EskinaziWritten by Can Eskinazi and Emrah SerdanWith help from Çağıl Bocutoğlu, Deren Ertaş, and Yoel Meranda—The Editors Please support the work we're doing here at The Hinternet.

      "content": "With the firing of the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, the present administration has made the world a worse place. The work that they do in estimating the national accounts is incredibly important to firms, policymakers, and to voters. Without the knowledge of what conditions in the economy are like, we cannot evaluate the impact of policies. Firms will have difficulty making plans for the future, and will be less able to know if the shocks they face are idiosyncratic or general. This is not one of those rare instances (like I covered recently) where less information is better.The accusations manage to be both baseless and logically incoherent. There are two paths to estimating jobs in America, household and establishment, and the reports in question relied upon the latter. They send out a survey to thousands of firms, and have them report their payroll data. Firms are often slow in getting this done, so the BLS essentially reports them as they come in, imputing missing responses, and revises old estimates to match new data. The BLS is doing its job correctly if the direction of the revision is not consistently one way or the other.It is logically incoherent insofar as Trump has spent several months prevailing upon the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The Fed will do so only if employment is weaker than expected and we continue to have low inflation! A low jobs report is bad insofar as he wants employment up, and a high jobs report is bad insofar as he want interest rates low. I found the whole thing appalling in part because it is so clearly a tantrum. The Darth Vader school of personnel management is not a very good one – we should not punish subordinates for accurately reporting adverse information!Subscribe nowThe work that they do is not substitutable. Contrary to cynics, it is not being done in secret by hedge funds. The clearest proof is that the market moves after the jobs reports. If firms were already doing what the BLS or the Fed does privately, we would expect their reports to contribute no new information and cause no change in prices. I borrow an example from this blog post; employment was 1% higher than expected. We also saw just a few days ago that, when the revision came in, stocks plunged.(Separating out the contribution of the Fed is more difficult, because it both reveals information about the true state of the world, and reveals what the Fed's beliefs are about the world which will then influence monetary policy in the future. In addition, it often comes packaged with concurrent changes in interest rates. There is a considerable literature; I link to Bauer and Swanson (2021) as quite recent work, and you can read the sources in the literature review back if you want.)It is possible that the statistical work the government does is crowding out private sector work. I think this is highly unlikely, for several reasons. First, information is a classic public good. The marginal cost of reproducing information, after finding it, is approximately zero. Any private company is going to charge an incredibly high markup.An illustrative example is the closest thing which the private sector does to government data, Nielsen Homescan. They collect two main datasets, the consumer panel and retail scanner data. The former has 40 to 60 thousand people record all of their purchases down to the bar code level, with hundreds of millions of entries a year; the latter is a sample of retailers including all purchases, and is in the tens of billions of observations. It is incredibly powerful, and can answer questions which absolutely nothing else can. (See in particular Jaravel (2019), which measured inequality in inflation experiences which showed up only at the bar code level). It is also extremely expensive – even for academic researchers, who get it heavily discounted, the cost is thousands of dollars.The government has substantial advantages over private sector firms. Revealing information about your firm is a collective action problem – better if everyone does it, but better still if everyone but you does it. The government can compel responses, and can also collect a census of all people or firms. Back to Nielsen Homescan, for years they couldn't get Walmart to cooperate with them. What good is it as a measure of the health of the economy as a whole if you don't know the sales of the largest retailer in America! I do not think there is any way to do what the government does in the Census of Manufactures.The government has a consistent methodology from year to year, and can guarantee that you are actually getting a sample. This is most relevant for employment figures, where one might think that you could turn to Indeed, BurningGlass, Glassdoor, or other companies to substitute. You don't know, though, if those companies are a representative sample of the population over time. Maybe things are going well for the company, but not for the economy as a whole.Any forecaster which specializes in predicting job market data, and does it well, will run into Milgrom-Stokey problems. If someone has a reputation for being right, people won't naively sell securities to them anymore. Instead, some of the information will leak out. Because they are paying a fixed cost to find information, this will lead to us finding an inefficiently low amount of information.While we cannot fully substitute for public sector data, there are several things we could try to do to improve private sector data. The first and most important is repealing Sarbanes-Oxley. Passed in 2002, the law substantially increased the cost of becoming a publicly traded company, and is likely responsible for the decline in IPOs since. It has sharp discontinuities based on the size of the stock floated – in particular, companies below $75 million are exempt from hiring an outside auditor, and companies below $700 million receive a number of accommodations on how much they have to test internal controls. Unsurprisingly, companies keep their size below the threshold. You can infer, as Ewens, Xiao, and Xu (2021) do, the value that firms are giving up by keeping small – 4% of market cap! Ahmed, McAnally, Rasmussen, and Weaver (2010) document an average cost of $13 million a year in compliance. A substantial part of the business model of private equity firms is not needing to pay these costs.Stock price data has advantages which other datasources don't have. Since it can immediately respond to news, we can infer the costs and benefits of specific events. (So long as, of course, the event is not itself endogenous to the stock market reaction, as I covered before!).An alternative possibility is to mandate greater data collection by payment processors. Currently, if you have extraordinary access to a private company, you can work with payments. However, these record only what money was sent to who, and not why. This may be impossible, but perhaps we could have what was purchased be automatically integrated into the data going to credit card companies. However, this has enormous privacy concerns, may not consistently represent the whole economy, and will have difficulty linking people together (especially if we want to preserve privacy).I will be clear. These are inadequate substitutes. The firing is one step closer to banana republic, and is a serious breach of norms. I am confident that the successor to McEntarfer, William Wiatrowski, will execute the duties of the job as he should, but I am less confident that the BLS can withstand continued politicized intrusions. Future administrations should consider setting up the BLS, BEA, and Census Bureau as bodies equivalent to the Federal Reserve, isolated from political vagaries.Support private sector data analysis!

      "content": "Francis Fukuyama is on Substack; last month he wrote Liberalism Needs Community. As always, read the whole thing and don't trust my summary, but the key point is:According to R. R. Reno, editor of the magazine First Things, the liberal project of the past three generations has sought to weaken the \"strong Gods\" of populism, nationalism, and religion that were held to be the drivers of the bloody conflicts of the early 20th century. Those gods are now returning, and are present in the politics of both the progressive left and far right—particularly the right, which is characterized today by demands for strong national identities or religious foundations for national communities.However, there is a cogent liberal response to the charge that liberalism undermines community. The problem is that, just as in the 1930s, that response has not been adequately articulated by the defenders of liberalism. Liberalism is not intrinsically opposed to community; indeed, there is a version of liberalism that encourages the flourishing of strong community and human virtue. That community emerges through the development of a strong and well-organized civil society, where individuals freely choose to bond with other like-minded individuals to seek common ends. People are free to follow \"strong Gods\"; the only caveat is that there is no single strong god that binds the entire society together.In other words - yes, part of the good life is participation in a tight-knit community with strong values. Liberalism's shared values are comparatively weak, and its knitting comparatively loose. But that's no argument against the liberal project. Its goal isn't to become this kind of community itself, but to be the platform where communities like this can grow up. So in a liberal democracy, Christians can have their church, Jews their synagogue, Communists their commune, and so on. Everyone gets the tight-knit community they want - which beats illiberalism, where (at most) one group gets the community they want and everyone else gets persecuted.On a theoretical level, this is a great answer. On a practical level - is it really working? Are we really a nation dotted with tight-knit communities of strong values? The average person has a church they don't attend and a political philosophy that mainly cashes out in Twitter dunks. Otherwise they just consume whatever slop the current year's version of capitalism chooses to throw at them.It's worth surveying the exceptions that prove the rule:The Amish: They live apart in tight-knit communities with strong countercultural values, and carefully control their technological and ideological environment. 10/10.Cults and communes: Any cult mature enough to have its own compound, or any communal living project, has succeeded almost as thoroughly as the Amish. We may not support their insane religious beliefs, or the various sex crimes they are no doubt committing, but they have succeeded at Fukuyama's suggestion of knitting themselves a new god within the liberal order. 9.5/10.Ultra-Orthodox Jews and Mormons: Get lots of people of the same religion together in one place - a timeless classic. Some of the ultra-est of the ultra-Orthodox are still more fluent in Yiddish than English, giving them near-invincibility from the mainstream. 9/10.The Free State Project: some libertarians made a deal that if enough other libertarians agreed, they would all move to New Hampshire and try to turn it into a libertarian paradise. They got about 20,000 people on board; the results ranged from building entirely new libertarian towns in the forest, to buying homes in Portsmouth or Manchester and keeping in touch with their libertarian friends. 7/10.Serious Christianity: Lots of Christians have social circles centered around their church, send their children to Christian schools, have Christian therapists they can visit if they feel down, and consume Christian media. On the other hand, they usually work a secular job, and most of their neighbors are secular. 6/10.The LGBTQ community: don't laugh at this one. If you know many of these people, you know they have their own parallel society of LGBT friends, LGBT bars, and LGBT dating sites. They attend LGBT parties, conform to LGBT fashions, and watch LGBT sports (like roller derby). They live in special LGBT-friendly neighborhoods, and everyone around them follows LGBT-friendly norms. They even have their own flag, an obvious first step for people trying to form a country-within-a-country. 5/10.The rationalists: I live on a street with five other rationalist families and a small rationalist microschool. The broader Bay Area rationalist community has its own parties, dating sites, media, holidays, a conference center, and even a choir. 5/10But even defining these exceptions broadly, probably fewer than 10% of Americans belong to one of them.Are the rest not interested? Happy with mainstream culture? They don't seem happy. 90% of articles on social media are people talking about how much they hate mainstream culture, sometimes with strong specific opinions about what improvements to make. But it never seems to occur to these people to join together with like-minded friends and secede from it. Why not? Why don't conservatives live in trad whites-only farming villages on the Great Plains? Why don't YIMBYs live in dense walkable towns sprung up from the forests of Vermont? Why don't people who hate smartphones/social media/AI live somewhere that bans all of those things?My best guess is money.If you're sufficiently committed, you don't need money. You can go out in the forest with your like-minded friends and probably starve (or, like the libertarians, get eaten by bears). But if you're insufficiently committed, money is pretty helpful! Or at least this is what I gather from my own experience. There are three reasons the rationalists have somewhat succeeded at the community-building project when so many other movements have failed. First, many of us worked in tech, and so ended out naturally gathering in the SF Bay Area without having to explicitly coordinate on it. We didn't even have to take less-than-maximally lucrative jobs, because all the maximally-lucrative jobs for techies are in one place.Second, some of us had enough money to live where we wanted (which turned out to be next to each other) and to cooperate to fund community projects.Third, some of us made enough money to support other people who were working part-time or full-time on community building. Some of this looked like hiring them for community-building positions, but more often it was being able to afford family/housing structures where not everyone had to have an income-maximizing job at all times.If we had even more money, we could do even better. Occasionally we fantasize about going further in the Amish or Free State direction. There are lots of reasons it doesn't happen, but the main ones are money (building towns is expensive) and jobs (not everyone can work remotely). There's some sense in which we're being weak here - the Amish are very poor, and just sort of take the plunge and do it anyway. But keeping our level of weakness fixed, more money would help.Why care about any of this?I often see people whose politics center around tight-knit community make fun of those whose politics center around material abundance. But these are potentially complementary goals. The more material abundance we have, the better we can be at having tight-knit communities.(yes, admittedly this is the opposite of how things usually work - some peasant village in medieval England had a tighter community than Malibu Beach or the Hamptons. I guess I would claim that \"so poor you can't leave\" and \"so rich you can be wherever you want\" are two different strategies, and liberalism is more suited to the latter.)I also see people say that if we avoid paperclipping, technofeudalism, and the other obvious ways a technological singularity could go wrong, the next thing we'll have to worry about is some kind of crisis of meaning, where we all sit back and collect UBI and consume slop in a spiritual wasteland.The optimistic perspective is that if this is so bad, what's to stop you from joining the Amish? Or some sort of pseudo-Amish who live in an eternal 1990s? Or your own Amish-inspired sect who have whatever set of technological and social relations you think are optimal? And the obvious counter is: there's also nothing to stop people from doing that now. But they don't. So whatever mysterious force prevents it now will continue to prevent it after the singularity.But I think that force is just economics. Most people have to work a normal job, which prevents them from running off to Hypothetical Amish Country. Replace that with post-singularity economic relations - maybe UBI, maybe something else - and new options become available.",

Across most sports, superior athletes tend to have lower levels of the personality trait of neuroticism. The best athletes—the champions—are likely the most emotionally stable, hardest working, and the most driven and energized. Agreeableness and openness don't seem to be as central to athletic success. (source).2. Charisma is a blend of two key traits: Influence, meaning the ability to lead others with confidence and competence. And affability, meaning the ability to make people feel comfortable and at ease. Research shows that charisma is strongly linked to professional success. (source).3. People who have a strong tendency to take offense are often narcissists. Their outrage is typically driven by an exaggerated sense of entitlement and an inability to tolerate even minor slights. In some cases, they may even pretend to be offended as a way to gain social or strategic advantage.

Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Bragging about replacing coders with AI is a sales-pitch (permalink) We spend a lot of time talking about AI's technical capabilities: what it can do now, what it might do tomorrow, what it will never do. But AI is only secondarily a technological phenomenon; it is primarily a financial phenomenon, hundreds of billions of dollars in investment capital in search of a return. The return on that capital only comes from one place: workers' wages. AI – as a financial phenomenon – represents that AI will a) replace, and/or; b) frighten workers to the point where more of the revenues generated by firms that buy AI tools will be returned to executives and shareholders, at the expense of their workforce. This is why AI bosses are so eager to cite statistics – conjured out of thin air, without any backing – about how AI is about to replace the majority of workers: https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/07/will-your-job-survive-ai/ And it's why tech companies that are peddling AI tools boast so brazenly about how many programmers' work can be replaced by AI: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andy-jassy-8b1615_one-of-the-most-tedious-but-critical-tasks-activity-7232374162185461760-AdSz/ After all, tech workers were – until recently – the princes of labor. Despite infinitesimal union density in the tech sector, tech workers were in such high demand that they could tell their bosses to go fuck themselves – and keep their jobs. Those bosses knew that a worker who quit during the morning scrum could have a better job with a rival firm before evening cocktails. While tech bosses cultivated a chuminess with these workers, treating them as peers (temporarily embarrassed founders, not employees) and sitting down for \"town halls,\" they clearly hated this and wanted nothing more than to put these arrogant pismires in their place. The instant tech labor's supply caught up with demand, these bosses mass-fired their precious tech workers, canceled town halls (\"Not a good use of my time\" -M. Zuckerberg), and told workers that the \"sweet spot\" was a 60-hour work-week: https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/27/some-animals/#are-more-equal-than-others Facebook announced a 5% across-the-board layoff and doubled its executives' bonuses – on the same day. They fired thousands of workers and then hired a single AI researcher for $200m: https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/07/10/meta-lured-ai-exec-away-from-apple-with-blockbuster-200m-pay-package Whatever else all this is, it's a performance. It's a way of demonstrating the efficacy of the product they're hoping your boss will buy and replace you with: Remember when techies were prized beyond all measure, pampered and flattered? AI is SO GOOD at replacing workers that we are dragging these arrogant little shits out by their hoodies and firing them over Interstate 280 with a special, AI-powered trebuchet. Imagine how many of the ungrateful useless eaters who clog up your payroll *you will be able to vaporize when you buy our product!* Which is why you should always dig closely into announcements about AI-driven tech layoffs. It's true that tech job listings are down 36% since ChatGPT's debut – but that's pretty much true of all job listings: https://apnews.com/article/ai-layoffs-tech-industry-jobs-ece82b0babb84bf11497dca2dae952b5 And the major decline in tech hiring isn't the result of hiring far fewer programmers – the tech companies have mostly cut back on hiring marketers, administrative assistants, and HR staff. The whole fucking economy is in freefall. It's so bad that Trump just fired the country's head labor statistician and pledged to replace her with a flunky who wouldn't produce numbers \"that made him look bad\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twNjon4tp84 The tech industry has changed. During the lockdowns, tech companies trumpeted their hiring sprees a performance of growth, staged for pandemic-panicked investors. Now, tech companies trumped their layoffs as a performance of AI's technical excellence, aimed at potential AI customers and credulous investors stampeded by FOMO.

      "content": "I have a new article at UnHerd that goes deep into the polling data to determine why Democrats are now so unpopular.Democrats have an image problem. According to a Wall Street Journal survey that has tracked the popularity of the two major parties for 35 years, a record-low 33% of Americans approve of the Democratic Party. CNN likewise reports an approval rating of 28%, the lowest in more than three decades of polling. Quinnipiac finds that only 19% of Americans approve of how congressional Democrats are handling the job — the lowest share in the 16 years the pollster has been asking that question. Aggregating the polls, the analysts G. Elliott Morris and Mary Radcliffe calculate a Democratic disadvantage of 10 points in net favorability — the worst figure the party has faced in more than two decades.One might be tempted to conclude from this data that voters simply agree with Republicans more on the issues. The real story is more complicated. What Democrats are lacking isn't so much the right policy package, but a demonstrated willingness to stand up to Donald Trump and his agenda in the second term. The issue, moreover, is less one of increasing Democratic unpopularity, than Republicans weathering a general decline in trust in institutions due to the unique connection Trump has with a significant minority of the country. Democrats cannot break this bond; they can only hope to mobilize the forces against it...So if not policy, what does explain the sorry state of the Democrats? It would be one thing if they were cratering with Independents. That would suggest that they are simply out of step with the majority of Americans. In fact, the party leadership is reaching new lows because it faces discontent among its base. In the CNN poll cited above, only 58% of Democratic-aligned adults have a favorable view of their party, compared to 76% of Republicans. Morris and Radcliffe point to a Strength in Numbers/Verasite poll showing that Left-wing Democratic voters are disproportionately unhappy: about 20% of self-identified \"very liberal\" Democrats now have an unfavorable view of their own party, far higher than the equivalent disaffection among \"very conservative\" Republicans, who are at 8%. If you factor out this Left-flank discontent, Democratic approval would rise by a net of eight points. In the Strength in Numbers poll, Democrats actually do better with Independents.Read the whole thing here.See the chart below for general trends, and notice how over the last two decades this is more a story of Democrats collapsing than Republicans doing all that much better than before. So much of our politics does center around the Trump cult. As I've been saying for years, Republican voters really like this man, and will adjust their attitudes towards issues and other politicians based on what he says and does. Start with that model, and you can understand a lot about politics. Even when Republican voters continue disagreeing with him or don't like some specific aspect of his conduct, they look past it.

      "content": "Looking back, the first few months of this summer feel to me like a slow escape from the terrible vortex of US politics. This happened in July in China, not in Germany. Berlin is obsessed with Germany's new government and with Trump, triggering endless painful questions about Columbia etc etc. Precious little else registers. Plus Berlin is home. It induces no sense of dislocation or puzzlement. It offers the comfort of the familiar, not a \"reset\".China is different. The experience is not so much that of jumping from a frying pan into the fire as jumping from a frying pan into a very busy swimming pool. Its a genuine relief, but there's no time for day-dreaming. It's time for \"heads up\". Looking back I realize that the first piece I wrote for the FT after the Tianjin summer Davos was still very much caught up in the comparison between the Trump administration in its \"Alligator Alcatraz\" moment and the shock of arriving in China.If people have said I was excessively kind to China in that piece, my response is that it really wasn't about China at all. It was really about seeing the ghastliness of America in a Chinese mirror. You are barely aware of the mirror itself. What you see is the face reflected. Backlit by the lurid mayhem of the US, the face that China officially presents to the world seemed like a retro-future projection of the Blairite/Clintonian 1990s.Admittedly, seeing Tony Blair up close for the first time at a lunch in Tianjin may have helped to trigger this \"back to the future\" moment. (NB: This was before his outfit's consulting work on the ethnic cleansing of Gaza was revealed). In fact, as far as China was concerned, the experience of the Tianjin conference center, where Summer Davos was hosted this year, was a rather shocking one. As a result, I am more open to the Michael Pettis critique of excessive investment than I have ever been before. The impression of the vast, empty buildings of the conference complex was truly Pharaonic, especially when contrasted with the exhausted delivery drivers on the ramps outside collapsed in the summer heat on their mopeds and scooters.I really began to learn things about China. Or at least it felt that way. And, as the experience sunk in, through hours of conversations with officials and journalists and think tank people, friends including many members of the wonderful Chartbook China team, more or less public gatherings, taking Chinese lessons face to face, pillow talk, gallery visits, outside walks when the heat permitted, road trips, \"hanging out\", as all of this piled up, the contrastive reaction began to fade.I am not saying that one can escape \"white guy goggles\". That would be silly. But what does happen is that your interests and self-identification and self-location shift. I found myself thinking about the US less and less. By the time we were doing events in independent bookstores in Chengdu I was joking about the therapeutic value of the Great Firewall causing me to dose my internet exposure, a kind of digital detox provoked by worrying about roaming charges and VPNs.This doesn't mean that you lose track of your train of thought, but your thought takes on a different focus and direction. And that's especially the case when the police and some rather ominous looking guys in plain clothes show up half way through the event and start filming everyone. The talk I gave at CCG about China and the Global Green Transition was one moment in this process, where I feel as though I found something to say about China that at least somewhat surprised my Chinese audience. The result was more interesting conversations with Chinese journalists including a particularly sharp colleague from the Global Times. Thanks to the great Zichen Wang of Pekinology for setting this up. Zichen Wang, Research fellow & Director of International Communication, Centre for China and Globalisation (CCG)Here, lightly edited, is the opening salvo of the talk:It is easy, when talking about China's industrial development, to fall into a sense of hyperbole—that we may, in some senses, be exaggerating what's going on. But in this particular case, there is, in fact, a need to double down on the hyperbole. One of the challenges of thinking about China's economic development—material economic development, especially the energy side of China's economic development—is to find the terms to do justice to the radicalism of what has happened, and therefore also the challenges that lie ahead. ... what this requires us to do is to pinch ourselves. To shake ourselves out of complacency and everyday banality. This graph, which comes from Our World in Data—a very familiar source—is as staggering a graph as I could possibly put on this board. But most of the time we look at it and respond by shrugging: \"Oh yeah, of course, that's what's going on.\" But look again! This is coal production in recorded human history. This is species being, in the Marxian sense—all humans who've ever lived. This is how much coal they have ever mined. And I don't need to tell you, but coal is a really good proxy for modern urban industrial development. Without it, no Industrial Revolution, no industrial capitalism, no fully organic surplus value production and exploitation, as Marxian texts laid it out in the 19th century. If you use this metric, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the history of our species on the planet—I do not exaggerate, this is all the numbers there are; there's not some other bit of unrecorded energy history out there that isn't captured here—it falls into three phases. The phase up to 1750, where human societies relied largely on a somatic, biological energy regime—firewood, human power, animal power. The period between 1750 and the end of the 20th century, which was the classic industrial regime, started by the British, copied by the Germans, the Americans, the Japanese, the Soviet Union, by China in the phase of development in the '50s and '60s.... climate politics at a global level was framed around in the 1980s and 1990s, when we thought we knew what the climate problem was. It was American-centred. It was Exxon. It was Texas. It was Europe. It was Krupp. It was the Ruhr. It was Europe. It was Western industrial history. But then comes the third phase of the history of global economic development.This is within literally all of our lifetimes. Everyone in this room is old enough to be part of this history, because it starts almost on the dot of 2000. And it is this explosive curve here.Again, let me just re-emphasise: there's no \"out\" here. There's no other bit of history we haven't considered. This is all of fossil fuel history as summarised by the coal variable, and you can see what China did to that history in the last 25 years. It's a sudden, utterly radical break with all previous human history. It's a break with China's previous history. China had heavy industrial development in the Mao period, which was heavy; it was large; it was incredibly inefficient. In the early phase of \"opening up and reform\" under Deng Xiaoping, there were two radical policies: one-child policy, and the other radical policy was energy efficiency. ... in that period, China grows without exploding the fossil fuel envelope through the late 1990s. And then, within all our lifetimes, something completely mind-blowing begins to happen in China. Heavy industrial production and energy consumption go vertical in a manner unlike any previous moment in recorded human history.Well-meaning people in the West will often say: \"Oh but China's emissions are actually down to the West offshoring its pollution\". Of course there was some of that. But it is a minor part. That's maybe 10 to 15 per cent of the Chinese growth. Most of it is Chinese urbanisation. It is the building of buildings like this—the office building we are currently in. ... It is the construction of China's massive new cities, the urbanisation of new migrants—of 500 million people—and the modernisation of the entire Chinese housing stock in the course of 30 years. ... the remaking of Chinese society as urban society has world historic dimensions ... almost 90% of the apartments that Chinese people live in today, all of you lived in and grew up in, were built since the 1980s. As a European, that's unimaginable. ... In China, everyone is living in a churned, remade urban modernity. And the basic argument of this paper—what I'm going to say—is that that changes the climate policy game.Thanks to Zichen and the CCG team you can read the rest (in unedited form) here.Shaking ourselves out of complacency, seeking to overcome the West-sizing (i.e. the measuring of much bigger and more dramatic Chinese things by the modest yardstick familiar from the West), checking the \"oh well yes, thats just China\" reaction, was also the theme of the conversation with Kaiser Kuo at his idyllic band camp in the mountain town of Shaxi.The last time Kaiser and I recorded, I think, was in a nighttime hotel room in Dalian. This conversation felt very different. I've edited this section of the transcript to make it more digestible. It was an exciting conversation, a slightly \"out of body experience\" and things ran away from me from time to time. This is one of the concluding exchanges: I started seriously thinking about China in the wake of writing Wages of Destruction. I then embarked on writing that book, Deluge, (in 2006-7) about the aftermath of World War I, when America emerged as essential to world affairs. What do we mean by \"world affairs\"? (The term was coming into widespread use at the beginning of the 20th century) You mean a world which is, of course, the European empires, but above all, it is already a world to which the destiny of China is crucial. That was the moment where I suddenly kind of joined up the dots in my own personal history and (finally and belatedly) realized there were a generational challenge for anyone in the West who is writing the history of \"modernity\" or attempting to think \"the modern\". There just is no reasonable way of doing that anymore without making a serious effort not only to think about China, but to think outward from China. After Deluge, Crashed was a testimonial to that. I addressed this recently in Chartbook riffing on the work of the geographer Jamie Peck, who was applying Stuart Hall's idea of conjuncture to the question of China's political economy. China is one of the master keys to understanding modernity. I would be tempted to say that it is \"the\" master key. Except that I am too much of a pluralist to want to claim that there is a single master key. We should be profoundly skeptical about any application of cookie-cutter social science models to China. Not just on general methodological grounds. But because of scale and historic weight. ... After all, the entire dataset of middle-income cases is like six Chinese provinces. ... This is the biggest laboratory of organized modernizations there has ever been or ever will be at this level organization. So, that changes this game. All of our previous social theoretic theorizing was a prelude ... the Industrial History of the West was a preface to China's industrial history. That's the message that comes out of energy history, for instance. And one of the reasons I'm fascinated by the climate problem is it's a way for me of writing a book about China. It's a way because this is the domain in which China has not just overtaken, but just, frankly, blown away every conceivable alternative center of relevance in the last twenty-five years.And so the energy transition is essentially a China problem at this point, as we were saying, 75% of all renewable energy projects right now are Chinese, 33% of global emissions are Chinese. And the vast preponderance of the growth in emissions has been Chinese. ... to give an example, concrete example of how thinking about China conceptually changes what we think a problem is. We thought of the energy transition as a static zero sum, how do I replace A with B. Well, China has shown us that, instead, \"development is the master key\", growth is the master key to understanding how we bring about really rapid and a change in energy technology. ... And that's, of course, far more applicable to the rest of the world. There's no point in talking to India about zero sum substitution, telling the Indians to shut down their coal-fired power stations when their per capita energy consumption is a very, very low levels is absurd. And it's even more absurd to tell African countries they shouldn't have gas infrastructure. Tell African countries to model that economic development along lines prefigured by Europe and to prescribe and gas infrastructure ... so I think that getting beyond thinking of Chinese growth either as an instance of growth in general or as some sort of exception to the general rule is key. What we have to grasp - and this is where the climate example helps us - is that China's growth is the central dynamic of world development. It is not an instance. It is not an exception. \"It is the ball game\". ... At one level this is banal. And yet, actually, when you look in detail at Western discourse, again and again and again, you see folks shying away from this realization. There's an unwillingness to face this reality. Why? Because it's disempowering, right? I mean, what it really means is this is the material dethroning of the West as the central driver of world history. This is really what the provincialization of the West looks like. And you don't have to spend a lot of time in China or go to a lot of places to see what that means in terms of physical manifestation, just the footprint, physical infrastructure here across the vast spaces of this country, the massive population.Kaiser: Yeah. Absolutely staggering. And yeah, it's a source of great frustration to me. I mean, I have paid some attention to your reception in the world at least of western, so-called China watchers, and nobody is treating you with hostility as a wide-eyed naive foreign interloper. It's not like, as a group, we've been particularly unwelcoming. A lot of us working on China, we go through a confidence curve of sorts. We start out very unsure, with a lot of epistemic humility, I would hope, then we become kind of dangerously confident. And eventually I think we arrive at or we ideally arrive at an informed humility. Where are you now on this arc when it comes to making strong claims about China? Where do you feel like you are?Adam: Well, see, my claims, are absolutely at the humility level, and there really isn't anything more humbling as learning Chinese as an adult. This is my fourth language. But, this is an entirely different experience. It's like learning to read again. It's not like learning about language. It rewires your brain.Kaiser: We were just talking about thatAs a tall white guy, as you settle into being in China, you begin to normalize certain things. One of the most banal is that whilst in modern China you are surrounded by all the familiar brands and accoutrements of modernity. There is one major difference. Those brand images and appeals are not directed to you. You are quite suddenly \"alone\". There is no one else around who is \"like you\". You can walk for hours, even in Beijing, and not see another foreigner. You become used to being a giraffe-like presence, gangly, towering, taking up too much space, weird looking, a zoo specimen. Occasionally jarred back into recognizing this as a novel experience, I asked DeepSeek to compile some data on foreign populations in major Chinese cities. It produced these figures, which, from experience and from specific searching on Chengdu for instance, seem to err on the high side. Whichever way you slice the data, these are astonishing numbers and should reshape the way we think about urbanism and globalization more generally. Urbanization in China, at least at this point, does not go hand in hand with global diversity. Once again, China is not just another \"case\". Nor does it make sense to think of it as an exception to a \"global rule\". China's cities are the most gigantic experiment in urbanization in history. If anywhere has a claim to define the \"norm\" of urbanism it is China. But perhaps what China teaches is that to posit a global norm of urbanism is a mistake. What we need to think in terms of is UNEVEN and combined development. China in 2025 may have as many as 160 urban centers with a population of more than 1 million. Of these 18 are megacities with 10 million inhabitants or more. For sake of comparison the US can claim to have no more than ten urban areas with a population of one million! Being in China makes you realize how profoundly anti-urban America is. There are only two US conurbations - NY-New Jersey and LA - that would qualify as megacities. On sheer scale neither would qualify as Tier 1 in the Chinese rankings. For further comparison, the EU counts 39 urban areas of over 1 million inhabitants but only one city-region, Paris, with a population of over 10 million. There is not a single city in either Europe or the US that can compare to the awesome scale of the largest Chinese conurbations. The closest thing in the Western hemisphere would be Mexico City. Notionally Mexico also has a GDP per capita quite comparable to that of China. But, anyone who has been to a major Chinese city and Mexico City in close succession will be able to rattle off the significant differences. So, what happens to our view of the world if we think the connection of globalization and urbanization outwards from China. That was the question that animated the most recent FT column. In that short piece I doubled down on the population \"diversity\" point by overlaying it with the question of the Chinese social media and internet world.If you even dip your toe into the Chinese internet you quickly realize that it isn't censorship or the Great Firewall that are the most powerful forces closing it to the outside world. They matter of course. But the idea that but for the prohibitions of the Chinese regime, there would be one \"flat\" internet and that it would look like the Western version, is deeply implausible. First and foremost the Chinese internet is the Chinese internet due to self-closure. That self-closure is driven by language barriers and the inward turned \"gravitational pull\" of a gigantic, fast-moving and endlessly fascinating national media system.In the FT piece, prompted by a fascinating conversation I had on the trip back to Europe in Singapore, I suggested that the idea of \"dual-circulation\" was an apt way of thinking about the form that globalization takes in China today. Standing further back, I'm left wondering whether the problem is not that as far as the modern period is concerned, we have so far thought globalization first through the global condition framed by the British Empire project (Geyer and Bright, Darwin) and then in the form given it by US hegemony. From tiny Britain to the \"continental\" United States, was one major step. America's nationalism - in politics, culture and economics - is one major difference between the two phases. How much more radical does this become when the driving force of globalization is a nation state of China's scale and cultural-linguistic peculiarity? We simply have no experience of any such system. The massive Chinese nation state has been progressively forged out of the maelstrom of violent experimentation between 1911 and 1949 by the PRC. In material terms it was given huge new energy by the extraordinary scale of economic development since the 1980s (at which point the train of thought connects to the idea of Chinese national economic development I sketched in the Whither China piece of June ahead of the trip). The challenge is to think through what globalization means when its most dynamic driver (some may want to argue with that) is not the British Empire, or US hegemony, but China - a huge, highly nationally specific, nation state and national economy still in development and very much under the control of a Communist Party that whilst actually dominated by quite conventional developmentalism insists on tracing its lineage by way of 1989, back to the epoch of war and revolution. Inside China, \"dual circulation\" seems like a good description. But what does this do to the world that is connected to China? Thank you for reading Chartbook newsletter.

      "content": "Source: Boston GlobeIn economist-speak, Friday's jobs report brought the \"hard data\" into line with the \"soft data.\" Before Friday, anecdotal evidence and independent surveys generally pointed to an economy facing major headwinds as a result of erratic policy, but official employment numbers still said that growth was solid.On Friday, however, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported weak job growth in July and, more important, revised down its estimates for May and June. The official numbers now show a slowing economy — not a recession, at least yet, but a marked slowdown. Here's the three-month moving average of job growth:Most economists found this report entirely credible. The BLS has a sterling reputation for careful, objective analysis, and as I said, Friday's report brought the official estimates into line with other evidence. What about those revisions? As Jared Berstein explained in a Substack post yesterday, revisions are normal. Without getting too deep into the weeds, the BLS wants to be timely, so it issues preliminary reports based on incomplete data, then routinely revises them as more data come in. Revisions tend to be especially large around turning points; what we saw Friday is exactly what we'd expect if the economy is in fact experiencing a significant slowdown, which would show up more strongly in revised data than in the initial reports.But Donald Trump screamed \"conspiracy\" and fired the head of the BLS, because of course he did:I don't want to spend much time debunking Trump's claim that there was a conspiracy to make the job numbers look bad. Suffice it to say that rigging the job numbers would be a complicated process, requiring the cooperation of many people, and we'd almost surely have whistleblowers telling us that it was happening. In fact, we will know that it's happening when, as seems highly likely, Trump's people politicize the BLS.And as I said, independent indicators also point to a job slowdown. For example, Automatic Data Processing, which does many companies' payrolls, produces independent estimates of private employment. People I know who follow these things closely consider ADP's numbers noisy and less reliable than BLS, but if BLS were rigging the numbers to hide the glories of the Trump economy, we'd expect to see that hidden Trump boom in the ADP estimates. We don't:So Trump's claim that disappointing economic numbers are fake news disseminated by radical leftists is ugly nonsense. But it was also predictable. Claiming that economic data you don't like is fraud perpetrated by a deep state conspiracy has been standard practice on the right for a long time, going back to the \"inflation truthers\" of the Obama years.Here's the story: U.S. unemployment soared in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. To mitigate the slump, the Obama administration enacted a fiscal stimulus program, while the Federal Reserve engaged in \"quantitative easing\" — roughly speaking, printing a lot of money.Many on the right went wild, insisting that these moves would lead to runaway inflation, even hyperinflation. More or less Keynesian economists like me, however, dismissed these warnings. Our models said that in a depressed economy with high unemployment expansionary fiscal and monetary policy would not be inflationary — in fact, I warned that the Obama stimulus was much too small.The Keynesians were right. Here, for example, is a comparison of the \"monetary base\" — bank reserves plus currency in circulation — with consumer prices in the aftermath of the financial crisis:The big inflation Obama critics predicted just didn't happen.But rather than admit that they had been wrong and rethink their economic models, many on the right insisted that runaway inflation actually was happening, but that government statisticians were hiding the ugly truth. For a while many right-wingers were eagerly citing quack analysts — sort of the economics equivalent of anti-vaxxers or climate deniers — to support outlandish claims about inflation. And I'm talking about influential voices, not obscure fringe figures. For example, in 2010 the historian Niall Ferguson, whom many still consider an important public intellectual, insisted that the official numbers were wrong and \"double-digit inflation is back.\" As far as I know, he has never owned up to his mistake.By the way, this isn't a case of \"everybody does it.\" When inflation temporarily surged under Joe Biden, I'm not aware of any Democratic-leaning economist, inside or outside the administration, who denied the reality of the inflation numbers, let alone attributed them to a political conspiracy. The paranoid style in American economics is very much a right-wing thing.And because on today's right every accusation is a confession, I predicted even before Trump took office that his administration would do what he falsely accused Democrats of doing, and begin manipulating economic data.However, even I didn't expect Trump to react to the very first bad jobs number of his administration by summarily firing the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nor did I expect Trump officials to be so blatant about their intention of politicizing the statistical agency.But that's what they're doing. It took just hours for Trump's chief economist to endorse his conspiracy theories and declare the administration's intention to replace BLS staff with political loyalists. On CNBC Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said thatAll over the U.S. government, there have been people who have been resisting Trump everywhere they canand declared thatTo make sure that the data are as transparent and as reliable as possible, we're going to get highly qualified people in there that have a fresh start and a fresh set of eyes on the problemI assume that I'm not the only economist already looking for alternative data sources that we can use to figure out what's happening behind the façade of the Potemkin economy Trump will surely try to create.The thing is, Trump's refusal to accept bad economic news and his likely attempt to corrupt official data probably won't fool many people. But he is, of course, surrounded by people who will tell him what he wants to hear, so he may succeed in fooling himself. And this means that when the economy starts to have serious problems, Trump won't even admit that bad things are happening, let alone make a serious effort to fix those problems.MUSICAL CODA",

Mankeeping, Pearson explains, is a term devised by Angelica Puzio Ferrara for \"the work women do to meet the social and emotional needs of the men in their lives, from supporting their partners through daily challenges and inner turmoil, to encouraging them to meet up with their friends.\"In its dissection of the issues, the article uses the modern meaning of \"emotional labor\", which involves tending to the emotional needs of someone you have a personal relationship with. There's no divinely ordained need for particular phonemes to represent particular things. But Arlie Hochschild, who invented the term, is a major intellectual force, and I think it's interesting to see the ways in which the term has evolved from her original meaning.Indeed, another recent viral New York Times relationship article noted that \"emotional labor\" has experienced tremendous concept creep, which Jean Garnett describes as an \"indication of our need for more ways to talk about the invisible affective labor that often falls to women\".That might be right. Hochschild's original meaning, though, was focused on socioeconomic class, and I think this recent shift in meaning is also an indication of the need to make the concept more relevant to the kind of people who read and share New York Times articles. Which is fine! But the intersection of gender and class in the burgeoning service economy, the thing that Hochschild was talking about in the first place, is important in its own right. It explains a good bit about the contemporary economy, about the discourse around \"struggling boys,\" and about the appeal of Trump's backward-looking economic vision. Read more",

      "content": "The tumulus where the Athenians who fell at Marathon are buried, photo by the Author.Civilizations do not start on a specific date, though the question is still open on whether they can end in one day (future nuclear or astronomic catastrophe, perhaps?). And yet, an argument can, and has been made that the battle of Marathon, which took place on 12 September 490 BCE, marked the beginning of what today we call \"western\" civilization. Science fiction writer and keen observer of human affairs Isaac Asimov wrote that:\"If the Athenians had lost at Marathon ... Greece might have never gone to develop the peak of its civilization, a peak whose fruits we moderns have inherited.\" (The greeks: a great adventure, Houghton Mifflin, 1985)This is likely not an exaggeration, as much as, of course, it is impossible to run experiments about alternate history.So what happened at Marathon? Arguably, the story begins around 510 BCE, when the Athenians kicked out their tyrant, Hippias, and a couple of years later established one of the first two democracies in the world (the other one was the Roman Republic, which began in 509 BCE).A few years later, a number of cities in the Ionian region, which had originally started out as Athenian colonies, rebelled against the dominance of the then young and expansionistic Persian empire, controlled by the usurper Darius I. The revolt was started by Miletus, which just a few decades earlier had been the birthplace of philosophy and had in turn expelled a tyrant and established a democracy. The Ionian cities asked their fellow Greeks for help, but the only two poleis that responded were Athens and Eretria.The allies were initially successful, surprising the Persians and going so far as burning the city of Sardis, in modern western Turkey. But they were eventually pushed back, and the Ionian revolt ended with the Persian win at the battle of Lade in 494 BCE.Despite the favorable outcome, Darius was so incensed by the insolence of the Athenians that he instructed a servant to whisper to him three times before dinner every day, \"Master, remember the Athenians.\"In 490 BCE Darius sent an expeditionary force to subjugate all of Greece and particularly to punish Athens and Eretria. The Persians laid siege, captured, and burned Eretria and then headed toward Athens. On the advice of the former tyrant, Hippias, who joined the expedition, they landed at Marathon, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Athens, intending to disembark their infantry and cavalry and march against the city.The Athenians, under the command of their best general, Miltiades, quickly marched 10,000 hoplites toward Marathon, reinforced by 1,000 infantry from the city of Plataea. These numbers are significant because at the time the total number of inhabitants of Attica, the region dominated by Athens, was 315,000, which means that the Athenians were able to field about 3% of the entire population. They gambled everything on a single battle, because they did not have sufficient men to engage the Persians a second time, had they lost at Marathon. Meanwhile, the Persian army could count on 25,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and 600 triremes.The Athenians were able to get to the place in time to block the Persians from advancing in the interior. At the same time, they sent their fastest runner, Pheidippides, to Sparta asking for reinforcements. (Keep this detail in mind, it's interesting.) The Spartans responded that they would send aid, but only after the end of the religious festival of Carneia, which meant that the Athenians and Plataeans would be on their own for ten days.The two armies faced each other for five days, with the Athenians biting their time hoping for the Spartans to come, while the Persians probably calculated that their light infantry would take a big risk directly attacking the heavily armed Athenian phalanx. On the sixth day, however, something happened. Either the Persians decided to attack because they had intelligence of the coming Spartans, or the Athenians moved because they saw that the Persians had started to embark part of their army, likely to send it to Athens via sea.At the onset of the battle the two armies were about 1,500 meters (1,640 yards) from each other, with the Athenian line four men deep in the center and eight men deep on both wings, matching in width the Persian formation, thus avoiding being outflanked, but still being outnumbered at least 2-to-1.Miltiades gave the signal, \"At them!\" and the Athenian hoplites began marching toward the enemy until they reached the so-called beaten zone, the space within which the Persian archers would be effective, about 200 meters (219 yards) away. At that point, the Greeks started to run toward the enemy, attempting to minimize casualties during the predictable shower of arrows.The Persians were stunned, and \"in their minds they charged the Athenians with madness which must be fatal, seeing that they were few and yet were pressing forwards at a run,\" says Herodotus. The daring move paid off for the Greeks, who made contact with the enemy after suffering few losses.Initially, the central Persian line was able to push the weaker Athenian equivalent, particularly because the Persians fought with their elite corps, the so-called Immortals. Meanwhile, however, the two Athenian and Plataean wings gained the upper hand against their Persian counterparts and were able to surround and close in on the trapped Persian center. At that point the Persians panicked, broke rank, and started running toward their ships, pursued and slaughtered by the Greeks.The full encounter lasted a bit more than an hour, by the end of which 192 Athenians and 11 Plataeans were dead, against 6,400 Persians fallen on the battlefield, plus an unknown number who drowned in the nearby swamps.The modern monument commemorating the famous battle, erected on location at Marathon. Photo by the Author.The context, however, was not over yet. The Persians were able to launch most of their ships and headed for Athens, which was, at that moment, undefended. The Athenians left a small contingent in place and rushed back home, arriving just in time to block the Persians from disembarking. That move marked the end of Darius's invasion of Greece. The Spartans, meanwhile, arrived at Marathon, but they were left with nothing except congratulating the Athenians for a job well done.Darius, naturally, was furious, and immediately vowed revenge. However, his effort to raise a new army against Greece was cut short first by a revolt in his domains in Egypt, then by his death. It was left to his son, Xerxes I, to invade Greece in 480 BCE, initially winning a number of clashes and going so far as burning Athens itself to the ground. However, his forces were slowed down at the battle of Thermopylae, where the famous 300 Spartans sacrificed themselves together with their king, Leonidas. The Persians were then soundly defeated by the Athenian general Themistocles at the sea battle of Salamis, and once more on land at Plataea. They never again attempted to exercise direct control of the Greek poleis (though they did manage to meddle in the Peloponnesian War pitting Athens against Sparta).A number of legends soon emerged around the events at Marathon. One says that the Persian center collapsed because of the intervention of the god Pan, capable of generating its own special brand of fear, known as \"panic.\" Another recounts of people seeing the phantom of the legendary Athenian hero Theseus suddenly appearing and leading the Greek army against the enemy, a scene later depicted in the famous Stoa poikile, the painted porch that eventually gave the name to the Stoic school.Of course, the most famous of these legends concerns the runner that was allegedly sent from Marathon to Athens after the battle, alerting the citizens by the cry of \"Nenikēkamen!\" (\"We've won!\"). The story apparently was originated by the conflation of two separate events, both of which I have already mentioned: on the one hand, Pheidippides's run to Sparta to ask for help, and on the other hand the forced march of the victorious Athenian army back home to prevent a Persian assault on the city.Nevertheless, the legend stuck, and when Pierre de Coubertin founded the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, the idea was proposed to institute a special running competition characterized by a length of 40 kilometers (25 miles), i.e., the distance between Marathon and Athens. Why, then, is the official distance of a marathon race currently set at 42.2 kilometers, or 26.2 miles? I'm glad you asked. The change was made at the London Olympics of 1908, so that the Windsor royals could enjoy a prime view of the race from their privileged box. Unfortunately, it still pays to be a king.A far more interesting question is why the battle of Marathon was so significant that Asimov said that it marked the beginning of western civilization. Because it was the first time that the Greeks defeated the Persians, thus shuttering the latter's aura of invincibility. Moreover, they did so without the help of the Spartans, considered by far the most powerful Greek army in existence. This dramatically boosted Athens' self-confidence as a fledgling democracy, and established its leadership among the Greek poleis. As historian Tom Holland wrote in his Persian Fire: The First World Empire and the Battle for the West,\"Their victory endowed the Greeks with a faith in their destiny that was to endure for three centuries, during which Western culture was born.\"According to another historian, J.F. Lazenby, in his The Defence of Greece: 490-479 BC, \"Marathon was won because ordinary, amateur soldiers found the courage to break into a trot when the arrows began to fall.\" The historical importance of the Greek victory was well understood even by the people who participated in it: the famous poet Aeschylus fought at Marathon, and considered it the most significant accomplishment of his life, so much so that he had the sentiment inscribed on his gravestone.Another \"amateur army,\" over two millennia later, defeated another empire, the British one, and established a new, still enduring experiment in democratic government, the United States of America. It is for that reason that I recently talked some of my friends into accompanying me to Marathon on one of my occasional \"secular pilgrimages,\" visits to places that I consider historically or culturally crucial, like the Stoa poikile in Athens, or the temple of Apollo at Delphi.Walking across the plain at Marathon, trying to imagine that moment when the Greek line began its fateful charge, I found myself thinking not about the fragility of democratic institutions, but about their stubborn persistence. Every generation faces its own Persian fleet on the horizon, its own moment when amateur soldiers must find the courage to break into a run despite the arrows. The lesson of Marathon isn't that democracy is eternal—it's that it's worth defending, again and again, by people who understand that some things are worth gambling everything on a single battle.

He is hopeful about the next generation of activists. Photo courtesy of Nathan Crick.You say the meaning of the word propaganda has changed over time. Why has that happened?It comes from the Catholic Church, where it refers to a way of propagating the faith. It’s an agricultural metaphor, propagation is seed spreading, which actually comes out of the gospels. So it had a positive connotation. Propaganda takes on a different tone after World War I. It becomes associated with war propaganda and the mass mobilization of citizens for violence in the early 20th century.And that’s where it basically stays: Propaganda is the tool of the enemy to destroy you. It’s connected with lies. It really has never lost that connotation over the years. Why does that word stick around? Because it’s just so effective as a piece of propaganda itself. The word propaganda is an amazingly effective tool for undermining the claims of your opposition, labeling it something that is not worth paying attention to, a fabrication. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . You write that propaganda has become an inescapable part of modern life. Why is it more inescapable now than, say, 50 years ago?That’s largely the social media dynamic of our 24/7 age. It’s in the vested interest of people selling ideas to mark certain products and social groups like territory: That thing is mine. You code it in a certain way to say, if you consume this, you’re a part of this group and not this other group. So you create these little oppositions wherever you go, and that actually serves both you and your opponent.For instance, our secretary of education confused artificial intelligence for A-1 the steak sauce, saying, “Every school should have access to A.1,” and now a certain group takes this and runs with it. It becomes a really attractive brand meme. Suddenly now a mention of A-1 steak sauce is understood as a critique of the Trump administration’s department of education. So the next day I get a T-shirt that says A-1 steak sauce with nothing else on it. I’ve automatically made this a political statement, which profits A-1 steak sauce and makes me funny, which is social currency.When Jimmy Kimmel mocks conspiracy theories, this is relying on propaganda to debunk such claims.

What are some historical examples of propaganda being used for good?If you look at it from a media history perspective, and go back to the American Revolution, you know modern democracy is a product of the printing press. It’s a technological phenomenon that’s grounded in the publication of the Declaration of Independence, one of the first mass-produced political documents in the United States. It was produced on broadsheet through printing presses and distributed to individual towns, and then spoken out loud for people to gather around and share. That’s why it was made as a single document, to allow all the people across the eastern part of the country to imagine themselves as a single entity.So, nationalism in the 19th century, this idea that we are the state, and that we are linguistically unified, was a product of propaganda. One of the reasons Benjamin Franklin was so powerful is because he understood the power of this press. He was a printer. So democracy is a product of propaganda.How can we use propaganda ethically? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . When we mention propaganda, attention immediately turns to the negative. Propaganda is what is done to us, which attacks us from the outside, invades our consciousness, and spreads lies. But propaganda is also what we do in response.When I teach, I like to show people how complex it is—that when I create propaganda, it has effects far beyond the initial moment. Sometimes what makes people do unethical things is that they just haven’t thought through the downstream impacts. With my students, I always have them do these reflective pieces at the end where they’ve been involved in propaganda and ask them, “What do you think about it?” They’ll take things that they’re involved in: fraternities, churches, work, school groups, innocuous things. But often they tell me, “I didn’t realize this was a strategy I was using to get my grandparents to buy all this junk that they didn’t need.” That awareness is the most important thing.What are some recent examples of propaganda that we might not be aware of?When Jimmy Kimmel creates satirical videos mocking conspiracy theories, this is also relying on the techniques of propaganda to debunk such claims. It was a global campaign of state propaganda that encouraged mask wearing and vaccinations during COVID-19. Pride parades and rainbow flags were once considered agitation propaganda. The recent “No Kings” rallies and subsequent coverage were organized propaganda on a mass scale. And every time a user reposts a news article or editorial on social media to “share widely” some important idea, they are functioning as a vehicle for the dissemination of propaganda.

The propaganda of climate activism tends to be parasitic on current events.You say that propaganda may be essential to combat global challenges like climate change where collective action and behavior modification are essential. What kind of propaganda do you envision playing a role in combatting climate change?We have long known that resistance to climate change policies was spearheaded by the energy industry with massive, coordinated, covert propaganda that spread three basic ideas: first, that climate change was not real; second, that even if climate change might be happening, it wouldn’t have damaging impacts; and third, that even if climate change was real and a genuine threat, the effects of environmental policies would be far worse. Climate activists had to argue the opposite—that the catastrophic impacts of global warming were real and that “green” policies were feasible and beneficial.Climate propaganda vacillates between apocalyptic and utopian myths. On the one hand, every news report of an environmental catastrophe—from heat waves in Alaska to Canadian wildfires to Texas floods to Indian drought to bark beetle infestations—becomes another opportunity for a vivid appeal that evokes fear and anger at the avoidable collapse of civilization. On the other hand, every technological innovation and progressive policy that makes use of carbon capture, clean energy, or sustainable development is compressed into a simplified idea, connected to a personal identity, and used to stimulate desire for a new way of life in harmony with nature. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The propaganda of climate activism tends to be parasitic on current events. When the news is bad, it gasps “See? It’s happening!” And when the news is good, it exclaims “See? It’s possible!” These extremes are unavoidable, however, because a complex, scientific “middle ground” may be more correct, but it is also ineffective propaganda.You have written that “fascism exists globally today as a self-augmenting, self-propagating rhetorical phenomena on social media.” How did this happen?Ever since the invention of the printing press in the 15th century, political and social history has been the story of increasing forms of self-organization. We all know the utopian version of this story because it is a celebrated myth of the technology industry. With the development and spread of accessible communication technologies, individuals become emancipated from state-sanctioned tutelage and begin to form autonomous, creative, and cooperative networks that culminate in non-hierarchical democratic politics. But the dystopian myth exists alongside the utopian one. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . In this story, state and corporate interests realize that it is far more efficient to control populations through propaganda than through force. The same forces that promote democracy also allow carefully crafted messages to spread effortlessly through populations, provided they satisfy certain basic needs—the need to belong, to exert power, to feel superior, to place blame, to acquire resources.In a technological society, social, political, economic, and religious identities all gradually fuse together until one ends up with just two basic antagonistic groups: “us” and “them.” We call this “partisanship” but it is really “sectarianism” because it is all-encompassing. What makes this so inescapable today is the ease by which any event can be labeled and incorporated into this binary system. And it occurs quite naturally. The mistake is to think there is some Wizard of Oz behind the scenes making this all happen. It is usually quite the opposite.Certainly, covert propaganda exists and there is no absence of state-sanctioned propaganda. But more often than not, and especially, in a non-authoritarian society, most everything happens out front. Leaders are really more like the conductors of orchestras. They simply take the ideas, biases, and connections already present and help them form a coherent whole with a certain tendency. In today’s culture, we all participate together in the segregation of ourselves into two competing groups because we fundamentally enjoy it.Where do we go from here? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The only way out of such a system is through it. One cannot return to some version of the past. This desire is itself exploited by propaganda. Ironically, many who participate enthusiastically within this system also despise it. They are fundamentally unhappy because fascism is institutionalized loneliness. Unfortunately, we cannot fight fascism simply by tuning out. We have to somehow get to a point at which the actual effects of this system on our lives becomes proof that this life has become unsustainable. But what do we do then? The answer to that question, for better or worse, is still going to be provided for us by propaganda.And the only hope that the answer we get from the propaganda of the future will be better than the answers we are given now is that very ancient faith that human beings do have an instinct for the truth, however long it might take to be realized. If we do not believe that people can learn from experience and have some sense of justice, then fascism is not something we pass through. Fascism becomes the culmination of human history and the end of civilization itself. I don’t believe this is the case.I think most of the time, when people act, it’s that enduring sense of who we are and want to be, what we can take credit for and feel proud of, that is the most important thing. It’s not what I do to someone else. It’s what I do for myself. And that is why I ultimately have faith in the next generation of activists and influencers to make better propaganda that calls us to our better selves.

      "content": "Lithe necks, blown-out lips, eyelashes worthy of a cartoon princess. The camels that compete in Saudi Arabia’s annual King Abdulaziz Camel Festival are a striking bunch. Many contestants, who are mostly female, have undergone cosmetic enhancements, including Botox injections and surgical procedures such as nostril enlargement. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . For the camel owners, winning a pageant can be life-changing—millions of dollars in prize money. But the same goes for the dromedaries: Some of the procedures can cause serious long-term harm to their health.A Botox scandal that led 40 camels to be disqualified a few years ago did not stomp out the practice. “It’s a continuous game of cat-and-mouse between rule enforcement and circumvention,” says Mohamed Tharwat, a professor of veterinary medicine at Qassim University in Saudi Arabia, by email.Cosmetically enhancing camels with medically invasive procedures may have started about 15 years ago, says Tharwat, but it has been banned by the festival since its inception in 2016. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Short-term pain, infections, and distress are some of the immediate concerns for the camels.Last month, Tharwat wrote a paper for Frontiers in Veterinary Science that calls attention to the alarming practice. Fascinated with camels from a young age, he later became a veterinarian, but his current work focuses increasingly on ethical and welfare issues related to the animal, which is so central to Arabian culture.Camel beauty is big business. Running for over a month, from late November through the start of January, the King Abdulaziz Camel Festival is the largest camel-related event in the world. It draws thousands of spectators and even more camels, and hosts falconry, racing, and other events apart from the pageants, according to Saudipedia, a digital resource maintained by the Saudi government.Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube have brought it and other pageants on the Arabian Peninsula to a broader audience, boosting demand for female camels with the features of a beauty queen, according to some researchers, who spoke to owners and breeders in the United Arab Emirates for a paper published recently in the journal Heritage. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . What judges tend to look for in a standout one-humped contestant are a pendulous lower lip and long upper lip covering the teeth; a wide and elongated nose; a long, slender neck; a high-set hump; and long eyelashes, among other traits. These beauty standards “are rooted in traditional Bedouin appreciation of camel form and elegance,” says Tharwat. But they don’t improve a camel’s health, or ability to provide transport, meat, or milk.The standards vary a bit among different breeds of Camelus dromedarius. The most popular breeds for festivals, says Tharwat, include the Majaheem, which are often black and known for their high milk yield, and the Maghateer, which range from white to light brown, and are known for their “elegant appearance.”For the Majaheem, ears that are long and forward-facing are most desirable; for Maghateer it’s short ones that are pricked backward. To produce the most beautiful contestants, owners use state-of-the-art breeding techniques. But some go much further.Illegal interventions include filler injections in the lips and nose area, lip stretching and binding, ear trimming, nostril enlargement, and injected anesthesia that makes the lips droopier, and by extension, more attractive. Some owners also inject their camels with testosterone, which changes the shape of the animals, in part by increasing muscle growth. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . But these enhancements have consequences: Short-term pain, infections, and distress are some of the immediate concerns for the camels, says Tharwat, but many of the procedures can also cause chronic health issues. Botox can paralyze facial nerves, making it hard for the camel to eat and drink. Reshaping the lips and ears can undermine sensory function. And testosterone can render a female camel infertile or suppress milk production. Perhaps what’s most frightening is that often these interventions aren’t carried out by professionals.Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube have boosted demand for female camels with the features of a beauty queen.Making animals more aesthetically appealing to their owners and other humans is by no means confined to the Arabian Peninsula. In the United States, people crop the ears of their dogs and dock their tails—practices banned in many countries but still accepted by the American Kennel Club as ways to help certain breeds “perform the tasks they were meant to do.” But it’s hard to argue that cropped ears on a Doberman have any useful value apart from meeting a standard of beauty. “They’re amputations, plain and simple,” says Barbara Hodges, director of advocacy and outreach for the Humane Society Veterinary Medical Association.The most thorough investigation of camel cosmetic practices took place at Saudi Arabia’s 7th annual camel festival that ran from December 2022 to January 2023. An inspection of some 12,385 dromedary camels at two different sites at the festival found that almost 8 percent had been tampered with, according to a paper in the Open Veterinary Journal from last March by Tharwat and colleague Abdulla Al-Hawas. The most common procedure: lip stretching. Nearly 8 percent of the inspected camels also had unusually elevated testosterone levels, indicating they’d been injected, probably as they were growing. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . What that investigation didn’t find is any evidence of a rare practice that sounds like it could have been dreamt up by David Cronenberg: surgically altering the hump. “It represents one of the more extreme and risky procedures,” says Tharwat. A hump that is large, high-set, and close to the tail is considered most appealing, but not all camels are built like that. “Because the hump contains fat reserves and is central to the camel’s energy balance, surgically modifying it could have serious metabolic and structural consequences, including infection, atrophy, or even death.”The dromedary has a storied history in the Middle East and Northern Africa. The nomadic Bedouins domesticated the animal about 4,000 years ago, and it remains vital to their culture, and, more broadly, to the Arabic people. A marvel of desert adaptation, the camel might be the most recognizable extremophile among megafauna. Even in the West, most schoolchildren know that these humped hoofers can go without water for an inordinate stretch of time—even weeks in the winter, when desert plants carry more moisture. And anyone who’s heard a camel roar doesn’t soon forget it.But the modern world is presenting challenges that the camel didn’t evolve to confront. While the beauty standards aren’t entirely contemporary—lip binding and ear shaping have been used for years—the new technologies have increased the potential for harm, Tharwat says. As the creature’s digital footprint expands, so has global interest in camel festivals. The role of the camel in Arabic culture—traditionally as beast of burden, livestock, and symbol of heritage—is shifting. As one owner cited in the Heritage paper put it: “Technology is changing the way we view camels.”And, for some, that view isn’t so pretty. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

      "content": "[Cartoon of bewildering 18th century democratic controversies, courtesy of the Met]Hahrie Han and I have a new paper, which has just been published by the Knight First Amendment Institute. We contend that when people in the AI debate talk about democracy, they usually do so in strangely limited ways. This obscures how AI might affect actually existing democracies. Crudely put, we suggest that many AI people would prefer a version of democracy that gets rid of the politics. That not only misses the point of what democracy is, but risks ignoring a multitude of urgently important problems and questions. How does actually existing AI affect people's understanding of politics? How might it reshape the ways in which groups and parties operate? What are the likely consequences of the efforts to turn LLMs into political-cultural chokepoints (see e.g. the Trump administration's \"anti woke AI\" executive order)? Subscribe nowSo what, exactly, are we disagreeing with? Existing debates about AI and democracy regularly suggest using AI to make democracy more deliberative and representative, if not necessarily more powerful, or alternatively want democratic tools to provide legitimacy to AI without any real accountability. Take, for example, this OpenAI solicitation from two years ago for applying democracy to AI and vice versa:We believe that decisions about how AI behaves should be shaped by diverse perspectives reflecting the public interest ... We are seeking teams from across the world to develop proof-of-concepts for a democratic process that could answer questions about what rules AI systems should follow. ... Beyond a legal framework, AI, much like society, needs more intricate and adaptive guidelines for its conduct. For example: under what conditions should AI systems condemn or criticize public figures, given different opinions across groups regarding those figures? How should disputed views be represented in AI outputs? Should AI by default reflect the persona of a median individual in the world, the user's country, the user's demographic, or something entirely different? ... While these initial experiments are not (at least for now) intended to be binding for decisions, we hope that they explore decision relevant questions and build novel democratic tools that can more directly inform decisions in the future. ... By \"democratic process,\" we mean a process in which a broadly representative group of people exchange opinions, engage in deliberative discussions, and ultimately decide on an outcome via a transparent decision making process.That all sounds anodyne enough, and indeed, that is exactly the problem. It is too anodyne. The OpenAI solicitation wants representativeness. The most popular approach to ensuring this in debates these days is 'sortition' - picking a representative sample of the population so as to create a 'minipublic' that notionally resembles the public as a whole (the same rough percentages of liberals and conservatives etc). The solicitation wants these representative people to engage in \"deliberative discussions,\" where they politely exchange views with each other, and update their own perspectives when they hear good counter-arguments. These discussions would center on questions that AI labs have tended to see as a massive pain in the arse, while avoiding topics that are central to their profit models (who decides on the release of new versions? who gets the money?) And all this is to be non-binding, unless OpenAI decides to the contrary at its own discretion, at some indefinite point in the future.Such proposals don't have much to do with real life democracy. Actually existing democracy, bluntly put, involves actors struggling over power and resources. That isn't enormously attractive much of the time, but such is politics. Given how human beings are, the great hope for democracy is not that it will replace power struggles with disinterested political debate. It is that it can, under the right circumstances, moderate that struggle so that it does not collapse into chaos, but instead produces civil peace, greater fairness and some good policies and other benefits, albeit with great pain and a lot of mess. In the essay, Hahrie and I explain why the existing AI democracy debate misses all this, and put forward an alternative perspective on politics, based on contentious publics. Again, if you are interested, go and read it.But there is an underlying question we don't really talk about much. Why has the AI-democracy debate ended up centered on this particular understanding of democracy? Cynics might retort that this is all hypocritical window-dressing, but I think they would be wrong. Go to a workshop or conference: there are many people who deeply, sincerely, believe in this vision. While the profit model is enormously important and helps explain the sharp limits in implementation (as well as, perhaps, why there is less talk of democracy at all now that it is out of fashion in America), it doesn't tell us why the debate ended up focusing on deliberation and sortition, rather than some other set of proposals.My theories about this are highly speculative, which is why they didn't make it into the paper. But they are in part supported by one of the great books of modern political theory, Hanna Pitkin's The Concept of Representation. This book is several decades old, but remarkably applicable to current debates.* It suggests that the kind of democracy that deliberation-sortition points toward is one that is likely to be particularly congenial both to sincerely motivated engineers and to those who are more directly self-interested.Pitkin wrote her book long before the resurgence of interest in sortition and mini-publics, and focused on arguments for \"proportional representation\" instead. But she captures the logic of more recent arguments extremely well. These, too are examples of what Pitkin calls \"descriptive representation.\" Here, the notion is that we ought be represented in politics by people who resemble us in some important way. The best way to represent the general public is through a smaller body that resembles it across the most important dimensions.Such an assembly, proportionalists maintain, must be \"the most exact possible image of the country.\" It must \"correspond in composition with the community,\" be a \"condensation\" of the whole, because \"what you want is to get a reflection of the general opinion of the nation.\" Other proportionalists invoke the metaphor of a map, apparently first articulated in a speech before the Estates of Provence in 1789 by Mirabeau (himself no advocate of proportional representation). \"A representative body,\" he said, \"is for the nation what a map drawn to scale is for the physical configuration of its land; in part or in whole the copy must always have the same proportions as the original.\"More specifically:Truly, as the map represents mountains and valleys, lakes and rivers, forests and meadows, cities and villages, the legislative body, too, is to form again a condensation of the component parts of the People, as well as of the People as a whole, according to their actual relationships.Of course, just as with maps, those who assemble a minipublic have to decide which features the map ought focus on, and which it ought leave out. The map cannot include all the details of the original, for fear it becomes a Borgesian monstrosity. As Pitkin puts it:Perfect accuracy of correspondence is impossible. This is true not only of political representation but also of representational art, maps, mirror images, samples, and miniatures.Such problems are highly familiar to software engineers, much of whose stock-in-trade consists of neat mathematical techniques for generating imperfect but usable mathematical and statistical representations of more detailed and complex wholes. From this perspective, the political theorist's notions of descriptive representation and the computer scientist's notion of a lossy representation merge into each other very nicely. It isn't surprising that engineers like the notion of minipublics, which seem like a implementation of the kinds of abstractions that they deal with every day, albeit running on human political interactions rather than software code.The more subtle problem, however, is that this is a theory of democracy as the provision of information about what the public thinks, more than it is a theory of democracy as decision making. Pitkin again:Representing [under this theory] means giving information about the represented; being a good representative means giving accurate information; where there is no information to give, no representation can take place.The legitimating notion of descriptive representation is that the map is a good working description of the whole - it may not perfectly represent that whole, but it is as good as we are going to be able to do in the real world. The smaller assembly is legitimate, then, because it tells us, more or less, what the larger public might have said if we magically had the technology to consult it en masse. Moreover, if you are a techie, you can immediately start thinking about neat tricks you might employ to make the assembly better representative of the public, better able to function and so on. Improving democracy begins to resemble the kind of technical problem you have been trained to work on, and you want to get to work on it.The problem, however is that this mode of representation is highly limited. The logic of a representative assembly isnot a matter of agency, of being authorized to commit others, of acting with a later accounting to others. It is not an \"acting for\" but a giving of information about, a making of representations about; hence it entails neither authorization nor accountability. That is why theorists of descriptive representation so often argue that the function of a representative assembly is talking rather than acting, deliberating rather than governing.Or, as Hahrie and I suggest, it is democracy without the politics. If, for example, OpenAI convenes a \"broadly representative group\" of members of the public to deliberate about how to represent disputed views in AI, that group has not, actually, been delegated by the public to represent its views. It doesn't report back to the public. It does not have power to make binding decisions on behalf of the public. If members of the general public want to yell at the broadly representative group because it has come to conclusions that they think are weird or wrong, good luck to them! The group has probably dissolved back into its component anonymous members before the general public has a chance even to find out what it has decided ought be done.All of that, then, provides a plausible explanation for why the democratic AI debate is so weirdly narrow, both in the solutions it proposes for democratic oversight of AI, and in the possible implementations of AI to improve democracy. One, fashionable theoretical approach to democracy - combining sortition with deliberation to produce 'mini-publics' - has the enormous advantage of scratching two itches simultaneously. On the one hand, it looks really attractive to sincere techies who want to make democracy better. On the other, it promises the more cynical that they can get some democratic legitimation for farming out decisions on vexing and unprofitable problems that they would prefer not to have to decide on themselves, without any troubling expansion of political accountability. Pitkin points out the limitations of this understanding of politics:there is no room within such a concept of political representation for leadership, initiative, or creative action. The representative is not to give new opinions to his constituents, but to reflect those they already have; and whatever the legislature does with the nation's opinions once expressed is irrelevant to representation.But if you replace \"the legislature\" in that sentence with \"President Macron\" or, for that matter, \"the AI labs,\" you can see why this limitation might look to some like an advantage. When minipublics come to politically inconvenient conclusions, those conclusions can be ignored.Again, this should not be taken as license for general cynicism. I can testify that there are many genuinely idealistic people working on AI and democracy. They often have great and intelligent things to say, and have to fight difficult internal battles to get the resources to do what they are doing, since it does not visibly contribute to the bottom line. Still, the more that democratic politics moves away from the mere provision of information about what a public purportedly thinks, and towards actual democratic decision making and control, the more difficult those battles are likely to become.

During the closing plenary session, I listened to three speakers, two of whom—Kate Raworth and Max Ajl—represented radically different approaches to our current crises. Though Raworth and Ajl engaged in respectful dialogue, the tension in the room became almost palpable when Raworth's polished slides on doughnut economics gave way to Ajl's anti-imperialist critique: Can an apolitical reform tool truly coexist with the Global South's demand for systemic revolution? The image shows three countries' positions within the doughnut framework. As clearly visible, Norway faces a significant problem with exceeding planetary boundaries. The Blindness to Power Raworth's doughnut model is undeniably seductive—a colorful infographic balancing \"social needs\" against \"ecological boundaries.\" Cities like Amsterdam have adopted it to measure how badly they're failing to meet the doughnut's requirements, and several Nordic municipalities are now considering using the model. The image shows three countries' positions within the doughnut framework. As clearly visible, Norway faces a significant problem with exceeding planetary boundaries. The model's fundamental weakness is its faith in data as an engine of change. It's built on an information-deficit model that assumes lack of scientific knowledge is the main barrier to societal transformation. This makes it blind to power. It presupposes that when wealthy nations are confronted with a graph showing \"planetary overshoot,\" they'll voluntarily dismantle the very systems that grant them wealth and privilege. But history teaches us one thing: No ruling class willingly surrenders its advantages without a fight. Consider what lies beneath Norway's \"green\" facade: The renewable energy transition depends on lithium from Bolivia and cobalt from Congo, where Western-backed militias enable exploitation. Norwegian wind farms threaten Sámi territories, repeating colonial patterns with a sustainable veneer. Norway's peace rhetoric accompanies pension funds investing billions in Israeli surveillance technology. This isn't just ecological \"overshoot\"—it's imperialism in greenwashed disguise. No doughnut chart can measure the systemic violence required to maintain Norwegian comfort. For Oslo—a city financed by oil exports and NATO's war machine—adopting the doughnut is like an arsonist installing smoke detectors while stockpiling gasoline. The Two Faces of Struggle Ajl's critique revealed a divide often ignored in Northern environmental debates. He showed that the fight for a just future must be waged on two distinct but intertwined fronts: The Global North's Task: Decommodification of essential services, support for anti-imperialism, demilitarization, and payment of climate debt.The Global South's Task: Sovereign industrialization, ecological planning, and resistance to imperialism. This asymmetry is no accident. A \"degrowth\" future for Norway, as a Northern example, must involve dismantling the war industry and a genuine reckoning with investments in extractive economies of the Global South. Moreover, reduced extractivism for Norway would require transforming her entire way of life. For instance, 43% of Norwegian households consist of a single person—the highest rate in the world—highlighting how deeply individualism is embedded in the society and how much housing needs to be decommodified, with greater emphasis on sharing and community. This represents a profound economic and cultural upheaval. Will it happen voluntarily? I strongly doubt it. As one audience member remarked during the plenary, this transition will most likely be forced upon the Global North through anti-imperialist struggles in the South. Our task in the North is to support these struggles. Beyond Dashboards We've already had our ESG workshops, SDG dashboards, and sustainability reports. We've made colorful posters and measured everything measurable. We've consulted, designed, and modeled. But has Norway stopped investing in war, or withdrawn from fossil capital's violent infrastructure? No. What about the live-streamed genocide in Gaza—wasn't that the most obvious dashboard revealing the imperialist system we're part of? Has this changed Norway's systematic complicity? No. What we need now isn't better indicators or prettier dashboards—we need clearer alliances between academics rejecting NATO-funded climate security research and focusing instead on Norwegian extraction in Sápmi, South America, and Africa; and labor unions demanding divestment from companies violating human rights and destroying nature in Gaza and beyond. The doughnut's appeal lies in its promise of a painless transition. But we must remind ourselves—and each other—of one thing: Justice isn't achieved by appealing to the oppressor's spreadsheets.

      "content": "Last month, Tulsi Gabbard in her capacity as the head of DNI released a number of documents pertaining to Russiagate. On the right, an entire mythology has grown around the idea that the Obama administration, Hillary, and Deep State actors fabricated the idea that Russia helped get Trump elected, along with the narrative surrounding ties between his campaign and the Putin regime. Even as someone who hasn't followed all the twists and turns of this saga, I knew enough to understand that some of Gabbard's most sensationalist claims were laughable. With great fanfare, she informed the world that the Obama administration knew that Russia had never hacked the voting machines to deliver a Trump victory. Under the headline \"New Evidence of Obama Administration Conspiracy to Subvert President Trump's 2016 Victory and Presidency,\" the DNI press release lists the following bullet pointsIn the months leading up to the November 2016 election, the Intelligence Community (IC) consistently assessed that Russia is \"probably not trying ... to influence the election by using cyber means.\"On December 7, 2016, after the election, talking points were prepared for DNI James Clapper stating, \"Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the US Presidential election outcome.\"On December 9, 2016, President Obama's White House gathered top National Security Council Principals for a meeting that included James Clapper, John Brennan, Susan Rice, John Kerry, Loretta Lynch, Andrew McCabe and others, to discuss Russia.After the meeting, DNI Clapper's Executive Assistant sent an email to IC leaders tasking them with creating a new IC assessment \"per the President's request\" that details the \"tools Moscow used and actions it took to influence the 2016 election.\" It went on to say, \"ODNI will lead this effort with participation from CIA, FBI, NSA, and DHS.\"Obama officials leaked false statements to media outlets, including The Washington Post, claiming, \"Russia has attempted through cyber means to interfere in, if not actively influence, the outcome of an election.\"On January 6, 2017, a new Intelligence Community Assessment was released that directly contradicted the IC assessments that were made throughout the previous six months.The problem of course is that the administration never claimed that Russia manipulated the vote tally! Everyone who is familiar with the most basic facts surrounding Russiagate knew this already. Go back to the first bullet point, with the quote that Russia was \"probably not trying ... to influence the election by using cyber means.\" Now look at the complete passage here, on page 2, taken first from the email of an unnamed Obama administration official:Russia probably is not trying to going to be able to? (sic) influence the election by using cyber means to manipulate computer-enabled election infrastructure. Russia probably is using cyber means primarily to influence the election by stealing campaign party data and leaking select items, and it is also using public propaganda. [emphasis added]Another email in response concurs with this judgment and repeats the phrase. The dishonesty is staggering. Put aside all other claims that Gabbard makes, this is so blatantly in bad faith that it's immediately discrediting, and should make you skeptical of everything else these people say. Especially when this lie is combined with calls for Obama to be prosecuted. The Trump administration is speaking to an audience that it knows is misinformed, or unable to understand the distinction between \"Russia tried to influence the election\" and \"Russia tried to change the election outcome by manipulating voting machines.\"This recent news renewed my interest in the Russiagate story, so I invited my friend Renée DiResta (X, Substack, personal website) on a livestream to talk about it. She is a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University, and the former research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory. She also did work on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. I used to take a very dim view of the misinformation crowd, and there are many researchers out there who give the field a bad name. I once saw institutions like the Stanford Internet Observatory as being at the center of a vast censorship complex that sought to simply stamp out all dissent from leftist orthodoxy. As someone who was repeatedly suspended under the old Twitter regime, I joined many on the right in seeing these people as a personal threat to my right to speak.If only the world could have stayed so simple! I could be a free speech absolutist, and never take any position that risks giving power to people who might eventually censor me. Yet recent years have shown that we need something like a community of responsible academics, intellectuals, and curators of content watching over the misinformed mobs that have been mobilized in the era of social media. If the flaws of the misinformation studies community made many of us believe in the desirability of an internet without any public or private regulation at all, the Trump movement and Elon's X have made the best case against that position one can imagine. The flaws of the media and liberal establishment can be dealt with through appeals to morality, compelling counterarguments, and attempts to hold people to their own stated principles. In contrast, there is no way to take a similar approach to MAGA. These people simply lack any interest in building or maintaining truth-seeking institutions, and are appealing to a political base that is so misinformed that it allows them to get away with what more sophisticated observers will recognize as absurd lies. All of this is to say we need people like Renée. She walks me through the latest Russiagate news, and dissects Gabbard's claims one-by-one. We start with the aforementioned non sequitur about the Obama administration knowing that Russia did not hack voting machines. We then go on to discuss whether Russia preferred Trump in 2016, the Durham annex, and more. One important point that needs to be emphasized is that the Senate Select Committee Report, with Marco Rubio serving as chair, concluded that the Russians tried to help Trump in 2016. This hasn't been controversial until recently. The two House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence reports quibbled with that conclusion. Note that the HPSCI was chaired by Devin Nunes at the time, whose job is now literally being the head of Truth Social, and working as an aide was Kash Patel, whose job is now literally being the head of the FBI after a time writing children's books teaching kids to worship Trump, and of course getting consulting fees from Truth Social. Arguments should be judged on their merits, but it tells you something when the mainstream of both parties agree on something, while the only ones who take the opposite position are known grifters and Trump lackeys. And even the HPSCI reports don't put forward the most radical claims spread by MAGA influencers and Michael Shellenberger types, like the idea that Putin actually preferred Hillary, or that the DNC hack wasn't carried out by the Russians. We close by discussing why this matters, what is at stake when we continue to debate Russiagate, AI slop, and what can be done to make social media better.

      "content": "Below is the second part of the transcript of my invited presentation to the Emmy Noether Research Group at the University of Würtzburg. If you would like to watch or listen to the presentation, here is the videorecording. You can read the first part here.This post is public so feel free to share it.ShareLet's talk about Epictetus himself. So I mentioned I think of him as a conservative Stoic innovator. He's very clearly drawing on, and referencing, and even using in his own teaching (because he was a teacher) previous Stoic philosophers. He mentions Chrysippus incessantly, as well as his teacher Musonius Rufus, but he also deviates from the other Stoics in some very interesting ways. He discusses the term \"virtue\" much less. He brings it up only at a few points in the the Discourses, and his teaching about it shows that he totally understands the Stoic point of view. He's actually got a passage where he's like: Anybody can give a discourse about virtue and vice. The real test is whether they can actually put that into practice, and what they do when somebody interrupts them. Can they can they get back on track with it or not? If not then it was just kind of surface level stuff He'll talk a lot more about freedom, or tranquility, or interestingly faithfulness, being trustworthy, a sense of shame or self-respect, aidos. And then he's constantly hammering on this \"in accordance with nature\" thing, but he's also going to change the way that's framed as well. He introduces these famous \"three disciplines\" that we don't find anywhere else in the Stoics. As a matter of fact we find three disciplines that are a little bit different in Seneca when he talks about ethics. He focuses very heavily on some things that are more important in other schools of philosophy, for example proleipseis, which we translate as \"preconceptions\" or \"general conceptions\". That appears to be originally a idea coming from maybe the Epicureans. It's definitely not a primarily Stoic idea. The \"what's in our control\" and \"what's not in our control\" that that people take a lot from Epictetus because it's right there in Enchiridion 1, the eph'hēmon and ouk eph'hēmon. That is an Aristotelian term originally, as is prohairesis, and Epictetus is taking these, and he's doing things that are not Stoic, but they're expanding the scope of Stoic Philosophy by doing that.And so this this term prohairesis that I wanted to concentrate on for this talk, it's used by a lot of earlier authors like Demosthenes, Isocrates, and Plato. It'll get used later by Philo of Alexandria and Plutarch. But it has more importance in the Aristotelian tradition, because Aristotle views it as the part of ourself that makes decisions, that engages in, it's often translated as \"moral choice\" or deliberative choice. It's not particularly important for the Stoics before Epictetus. It's rendered as \"choice before a choice\" which kind of makes sense right, pro- \"before\", hairesis \"choice\" There's no reference whatsoever to it in Musonius Rufus. I's not a term that Cicero notes being used and in need of having a Latin translation. We don't see it in Hierocles, who might be a contemporary of Epictetus. There's minimal use of it Marcus Aurelius. So we can say: What the hell is it doing there in Epictetus then? Well, it's absolutely central to his his entire philosophy. You could say that this is one of the main contributions that he is making. And there's a lot of different ways we can translate this. Just to give you some of the English translations: 'faculty of choice\", \"power of choice\", \"moral purpose\", \"disposition\", \"volition.\" Long will actually translate it occasionally as the \"self\", which I think is understandable, but not completely right. \"Moral character\", \"moral personality\". And then Michael Frede will will translate it as \"the will\", as have some other people as wellSo what is this prohairesis? If we look to Epictetus, there's there's a number of different characteristics, and I'm just going to mention four of them.One is that it really is the core of who you are. It's the core of the person. At one point he says: \"You are prohairesis,\" and that's you know about as unequivocal as you can get.He also tells us: \"You're not flesh or hair but prohaireis, so if you get that beautiful then you will be beautiful.\" There's an identification of the acting subject with your prohairesis. At another point he says that: \"You're not flesh or bones or sinews, but that which uses them governs and understands appearance.\" So you might see where we're going with this, a little bit of foreshadowing there. It's also the ethical locus. He tells us over and over again: \"Good and evil lie in the prohairesis.\" I mean it's not as if nothing else is good or evil, but that is the primary location you could say, and at one point he actually says (and this in book 3 chapter 10): \"Outside of prohairesis, there is nothing either good or bad.\" And it kind of makes sense if you know virtue and vice are what's really good or bad. The thing that does the choosing, the thing that's shaping itself, could work that way.Prohairesis is also free. It's the locus of our our freedom. And so he says that nobody is actually master over another person's prohairesis unless that person chooses to allow that to happen. So if you're looking for my praise and that matters to you, I become your master, because you're seeking something that I actually have control over. He goes so far as to say that not even Zeus, the god that is the whole universe, can hinder my moral purpose, my prohairesis. So if Zeus can't, then really nobody can. He tells us that nothing outside of the sphere of prohairesis can hamper or injure prohaireis. It alone can hamper or injure itself and that's a very important thing to point out, because when we talk about shaping our character, and giving reasons, we are the ones typically who screw ourselves up from an from an Epictetian Stoic perspectiveThe other thing that I think is a really important aspect that we're going to talk quite a bit about is the prohairesis, if you think about this \"choice before a choice\", another way of thinking about it is the pro- is choosing one thing instead of another thing, in place of another thing, prioritization we could say. Or if you like, preference, sort of like the the German Verhehmen that you see like in Max Scheler, a phenomenologist of value. You prefer some things over others, the prohaireis does that, right? We have a lot of examples of having to choose between something that's less valuable and the prohairesis itself being a certain way, and this is a choice that you make through the prohairesis. So this shows us it's a pretty powerful faculty.Now how does this fit in with the ruling faculty, or the rational faculty. Some Scholars like Anthony Long want to say that they're not exactly the same thing, that you can make a distinction between them. There's a lot of other traditions in philosophy that say that we have reason, or the rational faculty, or the intellect over here, the cognitive faculty, and then we have the faculty of volition, or choice, or however you're going to define it over here. And they you know they work together a lot of the time, but they're they're distinct from each other, and you can say this is cognitive versus affective or volitional.Epictetus talks in such a way as to make it plausible to say that prohairesis actually is the rational faculty, actually is the ruling faculty. All three of these are different ways of talking about the same basic thing. And this is, I think, pretty distinctive not just in Stoic philosophy but in philosophy in in general. So why should we think this is the the case? There's really three main reasons that I've isolated out and talked about elsewhere that stem from his writings themselves and from common features.So when it comes to good and evil , he tells us that \"good and evil reside within the scope of the prohairesis.\" So what about the the rational and governing faculties? He tells us in book 2 chapter 8: \"What is the true nature of the good? It's intelligence, (nous), knowledge (epistēmē), right reason (orthos logos) in use and understanding of appearances.\" He also tells us \"the ruling faculty of a bad person is not to be trusted.\" I mean because it's their prohairesis. And in book 3 he tells us: \"The subject matter with which the good and excellent person has to deal with is their own governing faculty.\"So if prohairesis is where good and evil reside, then it looks like either it's in the the governing faculty, or it just is the governing faculty. There's also a stronger case that's provided by the reflexivity of prohairesis, and of the rational and ruling faculty. So what is reflexivity? It's when something bears upon itself. I mean a silly instance is the old liars paradox, \"this sentence is false\". It's reflexive. It's referring to itself. But when we take a position on our own selves, when we regret something, and we're like\" Oh I shouldn't have said that, to that person\" or \"Oh I did the wrong thing. I made a bad choice\", We are reflecting on ourselves. And this is part of the nature of being a human being, by being a rational being. So he tells us in book 1 chapter 1 that the rational faculty is the only one which is self-contemplating, self-approving or condemning, one that makes use of appearances, phantasiai, one that bears upon other faculties. So if the rational faculty is the only one that does that, and that's also what prohairesis does. I think you can see the conclusion: prohairesis is the rational faculty.He'll also tell us similarly in book 1 chapter 17: \"Nothing is superior to reason and analyzes it, because reason analyzes itself.\" In book 2 chapter 23, prohairesis is the self-contemplating faculty, and there's a number of other things that could be said similar to that. The whole conformity to nature, being in accordance with nature, he constantly talks about keeping prohairesis in accordance with nature. He also talks about keeping the ruling faculty in accordance with nature. So if there isn't a complete coincidence between prohairesis, the rational faculty, and the ruling faculty they're pretty close. You could say that they overlap, and there's just a tiny little bit of non-coincidence between them. Now there's a really important upshot for this in terms of giving reasons, and how we use reasons. In book 1c hapter 28, he says: \"What is the reason we assent to anything? The fact that it appears to us to be so. This is the nature of the intellect, to agree to what is true, to be dissatisfied with what is false, and to withhold judgment from what is uncertain. So when a person assents to a falsehood, rest assured it's not their wish to assent to it as false.\" And then he says: \"In the sphere of actions what we do have corresponding to what we have corresponding to the true and false? Duty and contrary to duty, the useful the not useful, what is appropriate to me and what is not, and similar things.\" So we've got reasoning processes going on over here in the rational faculty, concerned with truth and falsity, and nobody wants to ascend to what is false. And then all the other stuff, the action, the choices, the affective stuff, there's a similar logic going on. And they they basically map on to each other for Epictetus. When he talks about error he says: \"Every error involves a contradiction,\" in Greek a conflict, we could translate it if we don't want contradiction. \"Who is in error does not wish to err but to be right.\" And it's clear they're not doing what they want to do. He says: Every rational soul is offended by contradiction\". And that so long as a person doesn't understand that they're involved in contradiction, there's nothing to prevent them from doing contradictory things, but when they've come to understand the contradiction, \"they have to of necessity abandon and avoid it, just as bitter necessity compels a person to renounce the false when they perceive that it's false, but as long as the falsehood doesn't appear they assent to it as truth. So a person who can show to another the contradiction that causes them to err and can bring home to them how they're not doing what they want to do, and is doing what they don't want to do, is as he says \"strong in argument,\" in logos, and effective in encouragement, protrepticos, and in refutation, elenkhos. These are sort of common modes of discourse in ancient philosophy. So what is he saying there? He's saying there's again this cognitive side, you you don't want to be involved in getting things wrong in terms of your intellect. But in terms of what you're choosing to do, how you're living your life, what you're committing to, it's exactly the same thing. And if you want somebody to change it, you can't just yell at them, or punish them. You've got to show them how they've got things fundamentally wrong, and then they will want to change it.There's a good bit I'm going to skip over a little here, because I want to be cognizant of of time here. But how we can say how prohairesis actually works on itself? So it determines itself. And one way that we don't do it, the way that Epictetus thinks about, it's not like there's a little tiny person inside of ourself like a homunculus as we call it and that's the prohairesis, perfectly conscious, arranging, deciding. That's just an imagination that we have, and that's that's not like what we experience, and that's not what Epictetus tells us. Epictetus tells us instead: what is reason? It is a system, a systema, a connected network of phantasiai, appearances. And we could say the same thing about our prohairesis? What is it really? Well it's a bunch of habits. It's a bunch of desires and aversions. It's a bunch of things that we've chosen to do that have had their effects on us. It's also the thing that's doing that stuff. It is us acting on ourselves, and we work on it through how we choose, how we commit to things. He tells us that nothing is capable of hindering prohairesis, as we've talked about it, nothing that lies outside of its sphere, but only itself, when it has become perverted or or go on astray and through this it becomes the only vice, the only virtue. It uses all the other faculties, and these are good. They're not not important, but they're just not as important as as prohairesis. So we can ask: well how does it fix itself? How does it become more prudent, or more rational? And a lot of this is through cognitive means and this goes right to our theme of reason and reasons. So you apply reason through prohairesis to bring the governing principle back in line. He tells us in 2.18, this is a place where he's talking about all three of these working together, and he says that what we have to do is look at our, and it's translated in different ways, our dogmata, our judgments, our opinions, the things that we assert, or the things that we buy into. We need to look at those. We need to be very careful with with those things, and also our assumptions, our hupoleipseis. So we we work on those, and we try to get those better. We try to get them more in accordance with how things actually are, whether about intellectual, theoretical matters, or about moral matters. And as we do that, gradually we get better and bette. Aand one way we can do this, like he says is: \"Let a person transfer their judgments to matters that lie within the province of prohairesis, and I guarantee that they will be steadfast whatever the state of things may be.\" This is a constant theme in in Epictetus. So we have to have continual attention to these choices that need to be made. This is what he calls prosokhē, or paying attention, another important value and we gradually develop a life where we're more conscious of what we're doing with ourselves in relation to all of these things that belong to us, like our desires, our beliefs, our judgments about things, the things that people have told us that we've bought into, as well as the environment that we live in, which includes many other people and things that are going on. There's a whole bunch of other stuff that could be said about how we transform prohairesis, but let's take a little pause here because that's already a lot that I've thrown at you! We'll answer a few questions, and then we'll talk about habituation. I've got one key theme that ties in with how how this works in in practice, and then we can explore some other thingsSo she says: \"how is reason connected with appearances?\" Appearances are phantasiai, his term that covers a whole wide range of things. They're not all necessarily external, and some of them might be imaginations, some of them might be memories. It's a term that covers a huge scope of things. Epictetus tells us at one point that reason itself logos is a system, a sustema, a connected network of appearances. And so there's no one single thing that is reason in Epictetus it's understood basically as like a whole composite thing that's put together, which is kind of good news, because it means there's no node that could be destroyed that would then render us completely reason-less, you know, irrational. But it also, if you think about it, it also means that we're never quite done with putting it together. It's not as if we have a faculty of reason that we start out with and it's just perfect, and then it gets screwed up. We're continually building it. And you can say a similar thing with our our prohaireis. We're continually building it. When we were little kids, some of it was being built by us, but much more was being built by our parents for good or bad, or our teachers or whoever else, right? And since prohairesis and and the faculty of reason are sort of like two different ways of looking at the same thing, you could say that prohairesis is also a sustema, a network or a matrix of of things.So I'm sure there's some other questions as well.Well Epictetus is a Stoic, and so and he doesn't define freedom either as as self-causing. That's just um one aspect of it, you could say. I mean when we think about this term \"freedom\" itself, it's an ambiguous term. It encompasses a number of different aspects. Being able to cause yourself is one, or being able to determine yourself, we could say as well, is one key part of it. But you're you're never totally able to change yourself all at once, are you? I mean you can sort of like focus on this part as opposed to this part, and try to fix this thing over here, but it's it's sort of like — are all of you familiar with whack-a-mole, that that game where you try to hit the thing and it pops up, and then it pops up in another location? — so the moral progress is kind of like that. You're you're continually trying to work on one thing, and then another thing pops up over here, and you you work on that thing as well, but you're free to do that right? And you could say: \"Well, how free?\" Just a little bit. You know, we don't have to be totally able to transform ourselves in a moment in order to be free. And the other interesting aspect of it that constantly comes up in Epictetus isn't talked about so much by the other Stoics, except for Seneca maybe, is that we're we're usually misusing our freedom. This is a theme that also comes up with later thinkers like Anselm of Canterbury, or the existentialists. We can throw our freedom away and become, as Epictetus will say, enslaved to things, because that's the opposite for him of freedom. So I can make free choices to prioritize some things that I shouldn't prioritize, and that is going to render me over time less free, as I develop habits for example. He thinks that habits are incredibly important.Just the confusion about the self-causing term arises, because you're taking it in too strong of a sense. It's not as if you will yourself into being metaphysically. That's not what it means at all. It just means that we we have a capacity to work on ourselves, to determine ourselves. I think so long as you can keep it at a sort of mundane level, it doesn't wind up being that confusing. And if if \"self-causing\" winds up generating confusions, just change it to \"self-determining\" because that's basically what they mean by it. So sure, we do this all the time. Showing up here to the Zoom session is a case of all of us determining ourselves to do something that we had wanted to do before, and then we follow through on the commitment that we've made to it. We do this constantly. We often do it wrongly in ways that that allow other things to determine us more, but I don't think there's there's much tricky or mysterious about this unless we we think on too grand of a scale. Again Epictetus doesn't think that we can transform ourselves in an instant into a wonderful human being, but each moment that we're doing something, we have some capacity to intervene and choose one thing rather than another, or prioritize one thing rather than another. And I think this is not this is not particularly Stoic. Aristotle says similar things about at least some stuff. It's very common in later neoplatonic thought and Christian thought to say these sorts of things right.So I see that Sonya has her her hand up as well. The question about reflexivity and putting it into contemporary terms.\"Reflexivity\" is a contemporary term. There's an entire tradition called \"reflexive philosophy\" that you find that includes Maurice Blondel and Jacques Paliard and stuff like that.And is it tied in with Frankfurtian higher order, lower order things? I would say that we've got this general category of accounts that think that the human being is in some degree, with some faculty, is reflexive, and Frankfurt's approach to that (which is a very popular one in contemporary philosophy of action and analytic circles) is just one of many possible ways of articulating that. I think that Frankfurt's account is sometimes helpful in some respects, but I don't know that all of this can be understood in terms of higher and lower order desires, in part because it's not just desires, but it's volitions and it's thoughts about things.Now the other part that you were asking about, are we completely conscious about all these things? So Epictetus isn't Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre is kind of famous for very implausibly saying that we're basically conscious of everything, we just kind of hide it from ourselves. And so for example psychoanalysis is not what it pretends to be, because we don't really have hidden desires that have to be brought to consciousness. Sartre I think overplayed his hand, as Simone de Beauvoir herself also said: \"yeah this is probably wrong\". But he represents a certain extreme position that you do see a lot of people saying: \"Well if you did this thing, you must have been conscious of it.\" I think we're driven by poorly understood desires and implicit processes of reasoning all of the time, and Epictetus thinks that too. He thinks that part of what we have to do is bring these things to light, which sometimes we may not ourselves be able to do on our own. We might need somebody else to help us out with it. I think Epictetus would say a good psychotherapist would would function almost like a moral philosopher, like he's doing in helping us understand just how screwed up the things that we've committed ourselves to are. And so um I don't think that he thinks that we ever have like complete consciousness of everything that's going on within our our own psyches. Or to use another term that Albert Camus loved, lucidity. I don't think he thinks that we have complete lucidity of that. But now this is actually a great question, because so you could say: \"Well how the hell do we know that we're on the right track?\" We can have more consciousness, like you do see some people in life, and you're like: 'That person seems totally clueless about what they're doing. There's some surface level thinking going on, and then there's all this other stuff that clearly is happening, but they're not getting it. They need some real examination or reflection, or pick whatever you want to use. Over time you can become more conscious, although I think you're probably always kind of a mess as far as Epictetus is concerned, including himself. He says at one point I'm never going to be Socrates, but I don't have to be. I could just be a good Epictetus.Stefan has a question as well. The question is: what is the new feature in Epictetus's concept of prohairesis in comparison to the older Stoics?There's a couple things that you can say. One is that the ancient the other Stoics didn't pay any attention to prohairesis, period. And then you could say: Well yeah, but Seneca and Cicero do talk about voluntas and volitiones,\" and you can say: \"okay there's some overlap there.\" But it's not voluntas in the full sense of Augustinian voluntas, which looks much more like Epictetian prohairesis. Michael Frede is willing to say that Epictetian prohairesis simply is the will per se. I wouldn't go quite so fa.r I would say that Augustine is still adding, and other thinkers are adding, a little bit more. But Epictetus is pretty close to the the later ancient concept o the will.You could also say it's interesting that he takes essentially an Aristotelian term —Aristotle is the first great theorist of prohairesis — and then has no problem whatsoever using it in whatever way he wants. But he goes beyond Aristotle. For Aristotle if prohairesis is self-determining, you have to kind of read that in. It's very clear in Epistetis that it is who you are. It is the core of the person. And no earlier Stoic says that, so that's definitely an advance, its capacity to determine itself freely without anything else hindering it unless it chooses to allow that to happen. I would say that that's something new too. Can you say the other Stoics didn't have any conception of that? We don't know because we don't have the writings. We have summaries of their doctrine in Cicero, Arius Didymus, and Diogenes Laertes, but maybe they didn't pay attention to it. It's difficult to say with any certainty. What we can say is like: Holy crap! For this Epictetus guy, he won't shut up about this thing! So even if we're just gonna go by some lexical thing like word count, it's clearly much more important for him than for any other philosopher before him, and maybe any philosopher after him, because I mean who uses Greek to these days to write about it? I will say one other thing too, a little bit of a trivia. When philosophy is moving from from Greek into Latin, I think a lot of confusion got generated by the translation. It's not prohairesis that gets translated as voluntas. It's boulēsis, which is rational desire. So we see that in Cicero, we see that in Augustine, we see that showing up in Thomas Aquinas when he's doing his commentary on Aristotle. Prohairesis gets translated as liberum arbitrium, which is usually cast as something the will does, but it's not the will itself. When I think that Epictetian prohairesis really is like the will, just maybe there's there's a little bit more added to it as as things go on, but it's pretty close. So I'm more or less in agreement with with Frede on that, and I think Long is actually wrong. I don't think that prohairesis, the rational faculty, and the hegemonikon are different in Epictetus. I think they they basically are the same thing.Gregory B. Sadler - That Philosophy Guy is a reader-supported publication.

      "content": "The meteoric rise of the S&P 500 since the Great Financial Crisis has dominated financial headlines and sparked a provocative question among investors: Is value investing dead? The spectacular performance of growth stocks, particularly mega-cap technology companies, has led many to write the obituary for value strategies. But as Mark Twain might have said, reports of value's death have been greatly exaggerated.The Global Value Story Tells a Different TaleIf the underperformance of value stocks in the U.S. truly signaled the end of the value premium, we should observe similar patterns across global markets. The international evidence, however, paints a strikingly different picture.International Developed Markets: Value's Strong ComebackConsider the performance comparison between Vanguard's Developed Markets Index Fund (VTMGX) and Dimensional's value-focused international funds over multiple time horizons. Data from Morningstar as of August 1, 2025.The numbers are compelling. Over the past five years, international value stocks have delivered exceptional outperformance—large value by approximately 8% annually and small value by 6% annually. This robust performance has elevated value's standing across longer time periods as well. Both value strategies now lead over 10-year periods, while international small value stocks have maintained their edge over 15 years with a 1.8% annual premium.Emerging Markets: The Value Advantage PersistsThe emerging markets tell a similar story when comparing Vanguard's Emerging Markets Index Fund (VEIEX) with Dimensional's Emerging Markets Value Fund (DFEVX):The emerging markets data reinforces the international theme: value has delivered substantial outperformance over recent years, with the value fund beating the index by 5.8% annually over five years. This strong showing has translated into superior long-term performance across 10 and 15-year periods.The U.S. Market: A More Nuanced PictureThe U.S. market presents a more complex narrative. While value has indeed struggled against the broad market over longer periods, recent performance offers surprising insights:Despite significant headwinds in early 2025—where value funds posted double-digit underperformance through July—the five-year picture reveals a more balanced story. Large cap value has underperformed by less than 1% annually, while small cap value has actually outperformed by nearly 3% annually over this period.The Patience Factor: Understanding Market CyclesExtended periods of underperformance are an inherent feature of risky assets, testing even the most disciplined investors. History provides perspective: the S&P 500 itself underperformed Treasury bills during three lengthy stretches of at least 13 years (1929-43, 1966-82, and 2000-12). Investors who abandoned equities after these periods would have missed subsequent recoveries and long-term wealth creation.The same principle applies to value investing. Periods of underperformance don't invalidate the strategy—they're part of its natural cycle.The Valuation Opportunity: What the Numbers RevealWhile predicting the future remains impossible, valuations offer our clearest window into potential returns. Today's value stocks, particularly small value stocks, trade at historically attractive discounts relative to the broader market—a setup that historically has preceded strong value performance.Fund P/E RatioVanguard Total Stock Market Index VTI 22.7*Avantis US Large Cap Value ETF AVLV 15.7**Avantis US Small Cap Value ETF AVUV 11.6**Vanguard Developed Markets Index VEA 14.7*Avantis International Large Cap Value AVIV 12.6**Avantis International Small Cap Value AVDV 10.3**Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index VWO 14.3*Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF AVES 10.2***June 30, 2025 ** August 1, 2025These valuation spreads are currently at historically elevated levels, raising the question: Does the value spread contain information about future returns?Historical Evidence: Valuations and Future ReturnsAvantis's analysis of data from December 31, 1979, to December 31, 2019, reveals a clear relationship between valuation spreads and subsequent value premiums. When valuation spreads exceed their historical median—as they do today—future value premiums tend to be significantly higher than average.Data from 12/31/1979-12/31/2019. Periods greater than one year have been annualized.This historical pattern suggests that today's wide valuation spreads may be setting the stage for a period of strong value outperformance, similar to what we've already begun to see in international markets.The Path Forward: Putting Probability on Your SideThe evidence suggests that value investing is far from dead. While U.S. markets have presented challenges for value strategies over certain periods, international markets demonstrate that the value premium remains robust globally. Combined with today's attractive valuations, the setup appears favorable for value investors willing to maintain discipline through market cycles.Rather than chasing yesterday's winners or attempting to time market rotations, investors can focus on what they can control: building diversified portfolios that include value exposure across global markets and maintaining the patience to allow these strategies to work over time.The value premium, just like the equity risk premium, is cyclical, but the underlying economic logic—that investors should be compensated for accepting the higher risk of owning less popular, more distressed companies—remains as sound today as it was decades ago.Larry Swedroe is the author or co-author of 18 books on investing, including his latest Enrich Your Future.

      "content": "Growing up in Bulgaria, in a city teeming in stray dogs and cars, I was deeply distressed by the sight of each dead animal in the streets between home and school — deaths I could not prevent and could not bear. To cope with the aching helplessness, I developed a private superstition: If I touched each of the vertical bars on every fence along my walk, no dog would die. Sometimes I ran to touch as many bars as possible in as little time as possible, the impact bruising and callusing my fingers. Dogs continued dying. I continued doing it. When the school year ended, I was sent to my grandmother's house in rural Bulgaria, where every night I watched her say prayers to a god she believed would protect us from harm. Harm came anyway. To this day she continues praying. Pillars of Creation, Eagle Nebula, Messier 16. Infrared photograph. NASA / Hubble Space Telescope. (Available as a print and as stationery cards.) It can be hard to bear, how the cosmos went from hydrogen to the double helix by its own insentient laws, forged from the iron rib of dying stars creatures capable of the Benedictus and the atomic bomb, hurled ice ages and earthquakes at the rocky body of a world we now walk in skins and nervous systems over which have had no say, born into families and eras we have not chosen. Somehow we must hold all this choicelessness — hold the knowledge that any synch of chance could unseam a life — and still do laundry, still make art, still love. How understandable, how human, the yearning for an organizing principle more comprehensible and therefore more subject to control than chance, for some great hand to align the dice of the universe in our favor, for a magic wand. And yet as we lean on our crutches of magical thinking, we forget that we are hobbling through a reality already full of magic — hummingbirds and ghost pipes, cordyceps and cosmic rays. No one has Carl Sagan (November 9, 1934&ndash;December 20, 1996) in an unpublished 1979 typescript found among his papers at the Library of Congress under the heading \"Where to file? Ideas riding?\" Carl Sagan Nearly two decades before he formulated his superb \"Baloney Detection Kit\" in The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark — the benediction of reality completed just before that chance mutation of cells claimed his life — he writes: \"Superstition [is] cowardice in the presence of the Divine.\" So said Theophrastus, a contemporary of Aristotle and Alexander. We live in a universe where atoms are made in the stars; where life is sparked by sunlight and lightning in the airs and waters of youthful planets; where the raw material for biological evolution is sometimes made by the explosion of a star halfway across the Galaxy; where matter can be put together in so subtle a way as to become self-aware; where a thing as beautiful as a galaxy is formed a hundred billion times; a universe of quasars and quarks, snowflakes and fireflies; where there may be black holes and other universes and intelligent beings so far beyond us that their technology will seem to us indistinguishable from magic. How pallid by comparison are the pretensions of superstition and pseudoscience; how important it is for us to pursue and understand science, that characteristically human endeavor imperfect and incomplete surely. But the best means to understand the world that we know. There is no aspect of nature which fails to reveal a deep mystery, to touch our sense of awe and wonder. Theophrastus was right. Those afraid of the universe as it really is, those who wish to pretend to non-existent knowledge and control and a Cosmos centered on human beings, will prefer superstition. But those with the courage to explore the weave and structure of the Cosmos, even where It differs profoundly from our wishes and prejudices, to those people belongs the future. Superstitions may be comforting for a while. But, because they avoid rather than confront the world, they are doomed. The future belongs to those able to learn, to change, to accommodate to this exquisite Cosmos that we have been privileged to inhabit for a brief moment. Couple with Sagan on how to live with the unknown, then revisit the story of how Kepler discovered the laws of planetary motion while defending his mother in a witchcraft trial. donating = lovingFor seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the outgrown name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

      "content": "Last month, on the Daily Beast podcast, journalists Joanna Coles and Michael Wolff took turns reeling off a list of famous people who Wolff met while visiting Jeffrey Epstein's Manhattan home. The recited names were a who's who of rich, powerful, and perverted men, many of them recognized Friends of Jeffrey. But one name stood out as unusual: the Dalai Lama. (The list of names starts at about the 18:25 timestamp on the full recording.) Coles thought so too, asking Wolff, \"Did you actually meet the Dalai Lama at Jeffrey Epstein's?\" \"Indeed,\" said Wolff. Asked why the Dalai Lama was there, Wolff said that a lot of people hung out with Epstein to try to wheedle money out of him. And there was something compelling about the upscale salon-like scene: \"It was always extraordinary,\" said Wolff. Wolff said that he started spending time at Epstein's house in 2014, six years after the infamous pedophile was given an extremely favorable plea deal for sex crimes charges because, former U.S. district attorney Alex Acosta once said, \"I was told Epstein 'belonged to intelligence' and to leave it alone.\" Wolff was working on a potential book about Epstein and was given access to the now-deceased sex offender's wealthy social milieu. Epstein later became an important source for Wolff's best-selling books about President Donald Trump. Any writing about Michael Wolff seems to require the proviso that his reliability has been questioned by assorted enemies and media critics. Wolff is a gossip hound, practicing the art at a very high level, and he hangs out with unsavory politicians and oligarchs who might like the idea of having a famous journalist around — until he publishes a book about them. Wolff gets into marble-floored rooms that many journalists don't, so his comments are worth considering.[Photo credit: Joi Ito, 2003]With that throat-clearing aside, let's consider why His Holiness the Dalai Lama may have been at now-deceased sex trafficker and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's house. People generally hung out with Epstein for two reasons: sex and money. Wolff suggested that, in this case, it was the latter. Did the Dalai Lama, or an organization with which he's associated, receive a donation from Epstein? The Dalai Lama's press office did not respond to an emailed list of questions. I was unable to reach Michael Wolff for comment about the Dalai Lama's visit to Epstein's home.It wouldn't be the first time the Dalai Lama had received money from a sex trafficker. In 2009, the Tibetan spiritual leader spoke at an event for NXIVM, the abusive sex cult whose leader, Keith Raniere, was convicted in 2019 on seven criminal charges and sentenced to 120 years in prison. During the 2009 appearance, the Dalai Lama gave a speech and placed a ceremonial Tibetan scarf on Reniere's shoulders. For his efforts, the Dalai Lama reportedly received $1 million. The deal was made by billionaire heiress Sara Bronfman, who, along with her sister Clare, gave Raniere and NXIVM at least $150 million. Sara Bronfman was alleged to be having an affair with the Lama's personal peace emissary Lama Tenzin Dhonden, who was later removed from his post for corruption.Subscribe nowDespite evidence that he ran a child sex trafficking operation, the source of Epstein's wealth has never been sufficiently accounted for. People who spent time around him have said that they didn't know what he did for a job and that he seemed to do very little actual work. For some reason, billionaires liked to give Jeffrey Epstein huge amounts of money. Les Wexner gave Epstein tens of millions of dollars — he later said that Epstein misappropriated $46 million from him — along with one of the most valuable residential properties in New York City. Leon Black, who has been accused of rape in civil suits, paid Epstein $158 million for \"tax advice.\" Whatever Epstein was as a financier — sometimes he was described as a financial bounty hunter, reclaiming assets stranded overseas — he was adept at moving money around the world. And he had help from pliant bankers, as demonstrated by victims' lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, which led to nine-figure settlements. Sen. Ron Wyden recently said that the Treasury Department has documents about banks looking the other way for more than $1.5 billion in Epstein-related financial activity, and that Treasury should release the documents. Wyden, who has overseen a long-running investigation into Leon Black's taxes, also said that Black's payments to Epstein should be investigated by the IRS.In short, there's still so much we don't know about where Epstein's money came from and where it went — and to what ends. But following the money trail as far as it leads can tell us something about Epstein's network, how he operated, and who enabled him. And sometimes a single $50,000 payment can open up the aperture, letting in some light.In the official 2020 MIT report regarding Epstein's relationship with the university, two partners from the law firm Goodwin Procter \"analyzed all donations received by MIT, both those made directly by Epstein (whether individually or through his charitable foundations) and those made by third parties at Epstein's alleged behest.\" The report found that, during a 15-year period, Epstein donated a combined $850,000 to Seth Lloyd, a physics professor, and to the MIT Media Lab, which was then headed by Joi Ito. Michael Wolff mentioned Joi Ito as one of the prominent guests who attended Epstein's regular home gatherings. The report claims that Lloyd, who was placed on administrative leave before being allowed to return to teaching, accepted transfers from Epstein in his personal bank account and tried to conceal the source of the donations. The report similarly describes MIT officials as trying to keep quiet Epstein's donations to the Media Lab and his visits to campus. The report doesn't look at relationships between MIT staff and Epstein that occurred outside the university. While the authors write that they looked into donations that may have come through Epstein proxies, it's not clear how far that investigation went, or was allowed to go. Former MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito received at least $1.2 million from Epstein for his own venture capital firm, which the MIT report mentions in a footnote.The MIT Media Lab had an uncommonly high profile for a university organization, with an orbiting network of billionaire tech moguls, scientists, writers, government officials, politicians, and TED-talking NGO types. That made the Media Lab's director, Joi Ito, an important relationship for the prestige-obsessed Epstein. The two seemed to be in close contact, with Ito once \"strategizing with [Epstein] as to how he might be able to 'mollify the bad press' after a series of articles were published concerning a civil lawsuit brought by Epstein victims,\" according to the MIT report. Ito, who sat on the boards of the New York Times and the MacArthur Foundation, repeatedly solicited Epstein for more money for the university. MIT's investigators claimed that his big-money asks weren't answered:Epstein used ostensibly philanthropic donations in order to win favors, borrow academics' intellectual prestige, or to move money where it wouldn't normally be allowed to go. The MIT report describes Epstein using Professor Lloyd (with the professor's participation) to see if he could make donations to the university without setting off alarm bells:Over the years, MIT has hosted a number of Buddhist and Tibetan initiatives and organizations. Many of them have been led by the Venerable Tenzin Priyadarshi, a disciple of the Dalai Lama who has worked at MIT since 2002. In 2009, MIT established a \"a non-partisan collaborative think-and-do tank\" called The Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative Values. One of its top donors is the Prajnopaya Foundation, which in turn is funded partly by the Dalai Lama Trust. The Prajnopaya Foundation, a global humanitarian organization, is separate from but closely associated with the similarly named Prajnopaya Institute, which focuses on education. They share a Massachusetts address and a director: Tenzin Priyadarshi.In November 2013, Linda Stone, who first introduced Epstein to Ito, sent an email to Ito suggesting that a 501(c)(3) might be used to mask Epstein's donations, although, she wrote, \"there may be disclosure issues.\" Ito then took the idea to MIT's VP of Development, according to the MIT report.In 2017, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit called Education Advance donated $50,000 to the Prajnopaya Institute at MIT. The money for that donation came from an entity called \"J Epstein Virgin Islands FD Inc,\" which that same year gave Education Advance $55,000, according to IRS filings. Education Advance took in an additional $1,500 in 2017, which appears to be the only year it was ever in operation. Its IRS filings report no other donations or dispersal of funds, suggesting that Education Advance might have been purpose-made for the Prajnopaya Institute gift. After 2017, Education Advance never filed another Form 990, leading to its nonprofit status being revoked.Education Advance was overseen by Svetlana Pozhidaeva, a Russian model who worked for MC2, a modeling agency run by Jean-Luc Brunel, an Epstein accomplice accused of rape and sex trafficking who died in a French prison in 2022. Education Advance was registered to an Epstein-owned Manhattan building. Pozhidaeva, who had been photographed leaving Epstein's house, also shared a lawyer with him: Darren Indyke, who is now co-executor of Epstein's estate. Epstein's Virgin Islands-based foundation, the initial source of the funds, was sometimes called Enhanced Education.The Prajnopaya Institute transaction isn't mentioned in the 2020 MIT report, which covers the years \"between 2002 and 2017.\" The existence of the transaction had been reported a year earlier by the Daily Beast. MIT's media office did not respond to questions about why the Prajnopaya Institute donation did not appear in its 2020 report on the university's relationship with Epstein.The lack of official acknowledgement from MIT is another indicator that Epstein's money flows remain poorly charted. Some parties might prefer it that way. Epstein also helped muddy the waters by lying and exaggerating about the scope of his charitable giving — a deception that included Epstein making edits to Wikipedia pages about himself, his foundation, and some of his associates.The Prajnopaya Institute told the Daily Beast in 2019 that it returned the $50,000 donation. The Institute didn't respond to an email asking how the donation was brokered and if the Dalai Lama or Tenzin Priyadarshi was involved. A separate inquiry to Priyadarshi, sent through his website imonk.org, received no reply.Tenzin Priyardarshi (far left) and Joi Ito (far right) participating in a 2022 YouTube discussion called \"Transhumanism: Searching for the Spirit in the Machine.\"Priyadarshi has long been associated with the Media Lab and Joi Ito, who described Priyadarshi as his friend. They podcasted together and co-taught an MIT class called Principles of Awareness. Ethics programs that began in the Media Lab later moved to the Dalai Lama Center, where Priyadarshi is CEO. Ito and Priyadarshi have appeared on discussion panels together. Ito, a prolific photographer, has posted photos of Priyadarshi and the Dalai Lama, and he's cited them in his writing. The Dalai Lama has attended at least three events hosted by the MIT center named after him. Dr. Babak Babakinejad, an MIT whistleblower and research scientist who first alerted me to the Prajnopaya Foundation donation, offered the following statement:\"The MIT Epstein report is institutionally compromised. MIT has persistently resisted transparency regarding Epstein's connections to the Media Lab and its associated initiatives, particularly regarding Open Agriculture and its Food Computers. This project is implicated in fraud, environmental misconduct, and retaliation. These are issues I have been actively challenging as part of an ongoing lawsuit.\"Epstein's interest in MIT was about more than just showering a couple programs he liked with cash. Epstein visited MIT's campus at least nine times and attended MIT Media Lab events, which could attract wealthy tech and political figures like billionaire Reid Hoffman. Epstein spent time with MIT professors and staffers, some of whom he met through the literary agent John Brockman, who acted as a connector between Epstein and scientists and academics. It's hard to think that Epstein's MIT-related contributions during a 15-year period only amounted to $850,000, especially when the donations that are now documented were once obfuscated. As shown here, the Prajnopaya Institute donation means the real amount that Epstein gave to MIT is at least $900,000.It's not clear why Epstein, who as far as I can tell never mentioned Buddhism or had any association with Tibetan culture or causes, made a $50,000 donation to a Buddhist organization at MIT. Perhaps someone influential asked him. Perhaps he was once again looking \"to see if the line jingles.\" The alarm did go off after all, but it was too late for anyone to care.This is a reader-supported publication.

      "content": "I was watching an interview with David Foster Wallace, author of the famous best-seller Infinite Jest (which, due to its excessively long sentences, perhaps should have been called Infinite Sentence Length). In the interview, Wallace complained about the decline in the national attention span—the diminished willingness to spend time alone in a quiet room reading a book, evaluating a complex piece of art, or abstractly reflecting. He notes that with the dawn of the computer, we've grown accustomed to constant stimulation—to everything being quickly and readily accessible—and have neglected abstract reflection. The interview was from 2003. 2003, incidentally, was the year I was born. And while I'm not old enough to say \"back when I was a kid\" about very many things, I can certainly say it about this. When I was born, the forces Wallace warned about were infinitesimal specks compared to their modern bloat. There was no social media. Now, people around the globe spend on average an hour and a half per day on TikTok. About one in five U.S. users spend at least 2 hours on the app daily. On average, people spend more than 2 hours on social media every day, and U.S. teens report spending around 4.8 hours per day on social media. Now, were they spending this time on the Substack app reading my blog, that would be one thing, but they're not—they're mostly spending it on Instagram and TikTok, watching 30 second videos selected for being attention-grabbing in the first 5 seconds they're seen. I think this is likely not good for our happiness. Jonathan Haidt has made the case that excessive social media use is the primary cause of worsened mental health, and though his view is somewhat controversial, I think it is fairly plausible. Spending hours a day on social media is not good for us, and this is the best explanation of why we've gotten vastly more depressed since about 2010. A big part of the reason for this is that social media does not leave us fulfilled. After spending hours on social media, one does not feel as though they've done anything serious or important. They feel they've frittered the day away, spent it in constant search of stimulation, like a rat on heroin. Time on social media is addictive but it is not very enjoyable—people rarely report having thoroughly enjoyed some five-hour scroll session, during which they digested videos of no more than a minute in length. When one is only consuming 30-second videos, they don't actually enjoy the 30-second videos they watch. At every moment, rather than reflecting on the content of the video, they are deciding whether to skip it and move onto a different one. Rather than seriously enjoying it, they are constantly scanning their own mind for signs of dissatisfaction. One will enjoy music less if their main thought is whether they're enjoying the music enough not to skip it. For this reason, time spent scrolling tends not to be very enjoyable. There is a distinction between the fulfillment of momentary desire and genuine long-term satisfaction. Social media is optimized to satisfy our momentary whims. So is cocaine. But it does not leave us happy in the long-term. When one optimizes for a single highly specific value, other values tend to be neglected in the relentless pursuit of optimization. When social media companies spend billions of dollars trying to get us to spend as much time as possible scrolling, other values like enjoyment fall by the wayside. But there's something else that's unsettling about social media: it makes it so that people spend almost no time quietly reflecting.The most useful insights I've ever had have come when I was bored. In college and high school, I've had a number of boring classes, during which my mind would often wander. I've discovered most new philosophical arguments during periods of boredom. I sometimes worry that if I stop taking boring classes, I'll lose the ability to think of new arguments! But people don't spend very much time bored these days. Most people are never alone on a bus, doing nothing except allowing their mind to wander—and perhaps reading a book. They're always on their phones, probably on social media. This happens even during meals; in my college dining hall, those eating alone mostly are on their phones, mostly watching 30-second TikTok videos (unlike ME who was reading Substack articles—totally different!) Something important is lost if one is entertained every hour of every day—if one never has a quiet moment to reflect. We become a society of first-impressions, of quick gut-reactions because we don't have time to think about anything. Society has always been inadequately reflective, but I suspect that social media has made the problem worse. And we no longer spend as much time ingesting serious ideas. People spend vastly less time reading books than they used to. Only about 20% of teenagers read daily for pleasure, and one in three teens haven't read a book in the last year for pleasure. I sometimes think that my productivity would increase dramatically if I had to spend an hour a day alone in a dark room with no technology. This is where most good and original ideas come from—from thinking alone and privately. The fact that this has been increasingly stamped out, that we no longer have moments alone in coffee shops, on buses, or in restaurants, is rather alarming. How many of the world's great ideas would never have been thought if the thinker hadn't had much time to quietly reflect? Would Parfit have invented population ethics if he'd been scrolling rather than thinking? Would Jonas Salk have invented the polio vaccine? Would Norman Borlaug have had the ideas behind the green revolution if he'd been constantly scrolling?I don't mean to sound either superior or like a boomer kvetching about the kids these days. I'm certainly not above wasting time on social media. While I don't spend much time on Instagram and don't have TikTok, I spend too much time on Twitter. But I think it is a problem. It's not just making us miserable, it's also diminishing the kinds of deep flourishing that make life valuable. Blaise Pascal once said \"All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.\" Now, that's obviously wrong—even if we could sit alone quietly for a prolonged period of time, cancer would still exist. But I think that there is something to the sentiment; the experiences that are both most enjoyable and meaningful are those that require prolonged reflection and careful, sustained concentration. To the extent that our capacity for deep concentration is being diminished, life's deepest joys are slowly rotting away. In our dwindling ability to concentrate, something beautiful, something of incalculable value, is being lost. We are becoming more like rats on heroin, and less like human beings. We are losing the ability to read, to think, to ponder, to reflect, and to list many synonyms for dramatic effect. The world is becoming, in some deep sense, more hollow. Perhaps the deepest tragedy is that many young people who have known no other world do not know what they have lost—never learning the great joys accessible through sustained contemplation. A world of cheap dopamine, where cheating is easy via AI, is one where no one really needs to think very hard. That is perhaps a fate befitting various lower life-forms, but not one befitting us.",

      "content": "Today provides one of the most beautiful, delicate feelings that I know and wait for, and first I have to provide some backstory. I love cricket. In particular, Test cricket. A match lasts 5 days. So there’s room for back-and-forths, intense 20 minute periods of play forcing one team into sure defeat, then slow steady day-long grinds back into it against all belief – if they have the character for it. All of life is in Test cricket. I gave an overview, drew a lesson (do not keep your eye on the ball!) and waxed lyrical some time ago (2022). Anyway. So a match lasts 5 days. And matches are played in a series, like a series of three or - better - a five match series. So during the winter, England will travel, this year to Australia. They head off in November. During the summer other teams visit England. For instance India have just completed a five match series in England, just today. Which means Test cricket falls into two seasons, it’s all very weather dependent as you might imagine: in the winter, because of timezones, I leave the cricket on all night and listen ambiently as I sleep - or don’t sleep - or get up at 4am and doze in the dark with the TV on in the summer I have the radio on while I work or run errands (the cricket day is 11am till 6.30pm), or if I can’t then BBC Sport is the only notification I allow through to my Apple Watch, so the tap-tap on my wrist of wickets falling becomes a slow metronome over the day, and it’s incredible what a rich signal even that can become. A five match series takes maybe 7 weeks. There are short breaks between games. Today the result came down to the final day: will England win the series 3-1? Or will India win the final Test and draw the series 2-2? A draw is extraordinary for a touring side. Actually it often comes down to the final hour of a match and even of a series. Two teams mentally and physically slugging it out for over a month. Sometimes players break and go home and maybe never play again. Bodies are on the line; bones are broken, players - as this morning - are making runs through the pain of dislocation just to let the team stay out for a few more minutes. So I watch (and listen) and go to see matches live too. My mood during a Test season is governed pretty much by how the England men’s team is doing (that’s who I follow). I’m tense or ebullient or totally distracted or keep-it-calm, steady-as-she-goes hoping my watch doesn’t tap-tap for a wicket as England try to rebuild. That’s how it has been over this summer. (I know it’s only the beginning of August. Unusually England have no more Test matches this summer, so that’s it until the winter tour, though there will be other forms of cricket to watch.) I was at the Oval yesterday for day 4 of the fifth test against India. England had been on top at the beginning of the match, then India got back in it, then England, then India, then England had the remotest possible chance of climbing towards a heroic victory… …and that’s what day 4 was shaping up to be, as unlikely as that would be, I was there to witness that climb, a tense brick-by-brick build to an England win that would be out of reach for almost any side, except this special side… …then India, who are fighters too and also don’t know when they’re beaten - somehow with energy and endurance still after a whole day pushing hard - broke through when things otherwise seemed done and dusted and the game is wide open once again, the relentless drums and the obstinate chipping away and… You see that’s how it is. Bad light and then rain stopped play at the end of day 4. No matter, day 5. You wonder how the players sleep at night. England lost finally. There’s no fairytale ending guaranteed in cricket, though the force of narrative does often operate, carrying the impossible into inevitability through will and the momentum of story. So my nerves are shredded and I lost an hour this morning, which is all of day 5 it took, staring at the radio, willing England to do it… They didn’t. As I said, India won the match and drew the series 2-2. It wasn’t quite up there with Australia in England 2023 which my god was the greatest series since 2005 – but, y’know, close. Oh and in 2023 I was there on the final day there at the Oval and I could write a hundred pages on that day, it was exquisite, sublime, being there in that final moment, to sit there, to witness it. Back to that feeling I was talking about. You know, I could talk about everything else in life this is like, because there’s a lot, but I’ll let you think about that and meanwhile I’ll talk about cricket. The last ball is bowled, the result is known, the series is over and – it’s just a game. That’s the feeling, that moment of transition where this drama which has been fizzing in the back of my head and the pit of my stomach for the last two months, and it means so much, just… slips away… and it was all just a game, it doesn’t matter. It’s beautiful. And sad. And beautiful. Traditionally the last match of the Test summer is played at the Oval in south London - not always - and the ground is up the road from me, so I try to be there if I’m lucky enough to get a ticket. I wasn’t there this year because the game went to day 5. So I saw the last full day, but not the final hour. And more usually the last Test would be in September too. But. There is something about the Oval in the early evening light, when the shadows are getting long and the blue sky has wispy clouds and it is headed towards evening, and you’ve been sitting there all day, emotionally exhausted from riding the waves of the day and the last couple of months, you willingly gave yourself to it all that time, when the tension slips away, the dream of summer is done and you feel lost because something has ended and simultaneously great joy to be able to look back at it and re-live moments in your thoughts, the transition from current experience to mere memory occurs in minutes. You sit back and you gaze at the green field and the players still in their whites being interviewed, and the blue sky and the noise of people all around and the tension is gone, and the fists in the sky or the head in your hands from only seconds before ebbs away and in the end none of it matters and you were there, you lived it, and you soak it in that feeling. I wasn’t able to have that this year, the stars didn’t align. Which means that next time –",

      "content": "Matsyanyaaya: Trump2.0 and India - the Avengers editionBig fish eating small fish = Foreign Policy in action—Pranay KotasthaneThe last time we discussed Trump 2.0 and India was in February, just ahead of the Indian PM's visit to Washington. At that time, the Indian government, anticipating Trump's tariffs, floated the idea of a mini trade deal. The other concern back then was the deportation of illegal Indian migrants. Given these uncertainties, I proposed this framework in edition #288 to evaluate the state of India-US relations. In this framework, the two most uncertain yet important factors constituting the two axes are:US-China relations. This is an exogenous factor, but perhaps the most important one for the US-India partnership. While the structural competition between the US and China will continue, it might take two different shapes. If Trump were to continue with Biden's China policy, there would be a further decoupling of US and China's high-tech sectors, and more aggressive economic coercion. But that approach is not guaranteed, given the business interests of Musk and Tesla in China. Trump has expressed that he wants to strike a deal with China. So the alternate possibility is that the US and China could come to an understanding on trade that limits the chances of a conflict in other areas—something we refer to as \"coopetition\", a hybrid of competition and conflict.State of India-US deals. It seems that the two most important issues for Trump are about striking a balance in bilateral trade deals and being tough on illegal immigration. Thus, India's willingness and ability to enter into a deal on these issues will be a crucial factor for the relationship. Specifically, there will be pressure on India to make some big-ticket military platform purchases from American firms.I had written that:As the framework shows, the upper two quadrants seem to favour the Indian interest most. This implies that the ball's in India's court. India should urgently propose a \"deal\" on trade and commit to addressing the issue of illegal immigration. Throw some defence and nuclear power plant purchase promises into the mix, and hope for the art of dealmaking to work in your favour.That trip turned out rather well. The hot potato issues of trade and illegal immigration, which could have derailed the agenda, were contained rather well, and there was a lot of continuity in technology and defence collaboration. The announcement to negotiate a mini trade deal had kicked the can down the road. Back then, I had placed the relationship in Quadrant 1. Since then, several things have changed. Musk and Trump fell out. Trump doubled down on his tariff fixation, and the April tariff rate card came in. Meanwhile, Trump backed off from economic confrontation with China once the latter brought out its repertoire of economic coercion tools. Then Pahalgam and Operation Sindoor happened. The Pakistanis were quick to hail Trump's role in bringing the confrontation to a quick end, while the Indian side continued to assert that the US role was only a sideshow. Trump's friendship with Putin ended, and suddenly Russia became America's top target again. All through this, the Indian negotiators were confident that a trade deal would be struck. Then came Trump's July 30 announcement of 25 per cent tariffs on Indian imports. He then threw in a number of rants into the mix—India buys Russian oil, India is part of BRICS, and it is a dead economy, etc. So where do we go from here? Using the same framework, I think we are now in Quadrant 3, the worst possible scenario for the India-US relationship. Following last week's events, there have been two kinds of assessments. On one side, the argument is that India should've done more to win over Trump by messaging his ego. Shekhar Gupta's latest column follows this line of argument when he says:\"The purchase of Russian oil was flaunted as an expression of strategic autonomy rather than quietly letting it be what it actually is—prudent purchase within the sanction-prescribed price band. This was a smart business decision. Smarter diplomacy needed it to be kept low-key...The debate in Parliament demonstrated that we are still trapped in Cold War rhetoric. The issues of mediation, for example. The government could've handled it simply by acknowledging that in any India-Pakistan crisis post 1987 foreign powers have helped by leaning on Pakistan. Foreign involvement has always been there, but never, after the Simla Accord, to mediate over Kashmir. Vajpayee invented a smart description for it: facilitation.A response like thanking Trump for putting some sense into Pakistan's head and saving it from self-destruction would not have hurt the Modi government. It could've just said this in Parliament rather than suggest Trump is lying.\" [Shekhar Gupta, ThePrint]The other side is the argument that India shouldn't bow down to Trump's unreasonable demands because there is no guarantee that a settlement now will not turn sour later. Former foreign secretary Shyam Saran's column takes this view:\"The way to deal with a bully is to resist bullying, because submission in the first instance only invites even more overbearing demands in future. What may seem like a small price to pay now will lead to a much higher price later. Not standing up to Mr Trump's demands now will trap India in an attrition process which will progressively demand even bigger concessions than now. Not drawing a line is fraught with long-term consequences for India's national security and its credibility and influence in the world...The geopolitical ramifications of Mr Trump's actions are even more worrying. He is demanding a veto over India's relations with other countries. This should be firmly rejected. India has good reasons to be part of Brics Plus, just as it does to be part of the Quad. The relationship with Russia continues to serve India's interests in many areas, though there is a diversification under way but for our own reasons. The very volatility in US foreign policy, where friend and foe can be changed on a whim, makes it all the more necessary to maintain and strengthen India's network of partnerships. The most important asset for India in its external relations has been its credibility and predictability. Nations can rely on India to follow a consistent path. We should not lose that asset to cater to a mercurial leader, even if he leads the most powerful country in the world.\" [Shyam Saran, Business Standard]There are some problems with both lines of argument. The idea that India should resist Trump's bullying seems to be a \"sour grapes\" situation now that the deal has disappeared. On the other hand, massaging Trump's ego is no guarantee of assured low tariffs because it's the one hammer he is likely to use again to achieve all sorts of goals, from ending the Russia-Ukraine war to arresting the decline of the US dollar. At the same time, both arguments drive home some truths. The first argument says India didn't read Trump well and was outplayed by China and Pakistan in this round. The opposing argument cautions that bending over backwards to satisfy Trump's ego carries reputational costs that will hold India in a weaker position in the next round. At this stage, here are three observations for the near future.A relatively high tariff for India implies that exports to the world's largest importer will be hit. Based on existing White House executive orders, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and energy product exports from India are likely to be exempted. If that is the case, the damage to the Indian economy from these tariffs would decrease substantially. Last week has set India-US relations back by several years. The perception of the US as an \"unreliable\" partner will gain strength in India, even if that concept has limited value in the amoral domain of international relations. As we had discussed earlier, the weakest leg of the India-US tripod is how elites in both countries perceive the opposite side's governments. Trump's shenanigans mean India is even less likely to concede to substantial US demands in the future.Absorbing the effect of high tariffs requires India to reconsider its position on multilateral trade agreements and lower the regulatory barriers that make its economic engine operate at low efficiency. The deregulation agenda seems to have been shelved at a time when it is badly needed. Trump or no Trump, there is no getting around this issue.So that's where we are. For India-US relations to turn a corner, a dramatic worsening of the US-China relationship or a change in US leadership would be necessary. Until then, it's going to be a grind. P.S.: On the same day that Trump dropped his TruthSocial bomb, the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) Mission was successfully launched. This was the first time the two countries cooperated on hardware development for an Earth-observing mission. But this news was completely drowned out by Trump's takedown.Subscribe nowIndia Policy Watch #1: Canary in the Coal Mine?Insights on current policy issues in India—RSJIt is difficult to talk about anything other than tariffs in a week when Trump went on a tirade against India's tariff rates, its \"obnoxious\" non-monetary trade barriers, and its purchase of military equipment and oil from Russia. He promised a 25 per cent tariff and an additional undisclosed penalty on Indian imports for these alleged crimes. In subsequent posts, he called the Russian and Indian economies \"dead\", and rounded off what he might consider a satisfying night of posts by taunting India with some bizarre reference to drilling for oil in Pakistan. Despite all my desire to avoid reacting to random Trump provocations, it is difficult not to write about this immediate setback to the India-US trade deal that was in the works since April. But I will desist. I will give it another week and then think about writing on it. Maybe things will get clearer then.Instead, let me examine the Q1 results and commentary from corporate India and ask what we can learn about the broader state of the economy.First, there is an urban demand problem showing up in numbers. Rural demand isn't great either, but it seems to be holding up a bit. The Kharif crop sowing numbers are up by about 4 per cent over last year, so rural demand may also continue to hold up in the remaining part of the year. But urban demand is tepid, and this was evident across the board in sectors as diverse as auto, real estate, FMCG, quick service restaurants and hospitality. What worried me more was the SBI Cards results. Now this is the largest credit card issuer in the country and the larger share of its customers belong to the \"mass affluent\" segment. This is in contrast to other large credit card issuers who focus on the affluent or premium segments. SBI Cards reported quite poor numbers with their card delinquency rate upward of 9 per cent. This is about 300 bps higher than the historic average and suggests significant stress among its customers to pay off their credit card dues. This might be an isolated result, and maybe we shouldn't read too much into it. However, reading it in tandem with other results points to urban consumer stress.Now Q1 is usually a weak quarter, and there's always a hope that as the festive season sets in Q3, the consumption demand will show up. But the general sentiment in the various commentaries I read seemed to suggest a weaker consumer sentiment than before. This surprised me because two significant measures in Q4 (Jan-Feb-March) should have helped consumer sentiment. We had a tax break for the salaried class in the budget that totalled almost ₹1 lakh crore, which was supposed to show up in higher disposable income and spur consumers to go out and spend more during the year. Also, since February, the RBI has pursued a policy of easier liquidity after a year of keeping it tight and also cut repo rates by a cumulative 100 bps to stimulate credit demand. Both these measures were targeted to get consumption going. When seen in this light, the Q1 results and the commentary suggest the consumer is still waiting on the sidelines. Why? I think the real wage growth has stagnated, private capex remains low, and consumers aren't keen on spending or taking credit risks because they aren't too sure about their future. The problem with discourse in India is that there's so much noise about what the top 1-2 per cent of the income class does (high-end property registrations, luxury car sales, newer brands of boutique gins, whatever) that it drowns out any sober analysis of overall demand. There is still a lot of hope pinned on the trickle-down effect of rate cuts and surplus liquidity helping credit growth in the remaining part of the year. I remain somewhat sanguine about that thesis.Second, there is a cloud hanging over two sectors that have been particularly strong for India after COVID-19. Most of the commentary and direction from IT services companies suggested a weak demand outlook in their primary markets leading to delayed decisions or cut in IT spends. This doesn't look like a great year for India IT services, and given its size, that has a direct impact on urban consumption. Also, while most of these companies put up a brave face on the power of AI and how they are starting to ride that wave, there wasn't any direction on the size of the pipeline of such work. Instead, the impact of AI on automating the routine coding, developing and testing work is becoming increasingly clear. The recent news of TCS laying off mid-level employees because it wants to be a \"future-ready organisation\" deploying AI at scale and \"realigning its workforce model\" is possibly an indicator of things to come. To me, that sounds like corporate-speak for AI making an impact on their business model. I have spent some more time since I last sat around in various discussions on AI use cases that are live in organisations. I'm further convinced that coding and testing automation will be the fastest-growing use case in this area, and it won't be IT services companies that will be quick to adopt it. Their business model relies on people deployed and hours billed, which goes against the notion of widespread automation to support clients. Rather, it will be their clients in sectors like financial services, retail, telecom, etc, who will find it remarkably easier to train their in-house team to adopt these tools. It is possible that widespread adoption of AI will lead to a new service line emerging that the Indian IT service sector will ride. But that possibility (which to me is remote) will emerge only after a serious disruption in their business model has played out.The other commentary that caught my eye was about the SME segment. This has been a bright spot for India as China+1 has played out gradually across the manufacturing sector. Since 2022, most large banks and NBFCs have reported an upward of 20 per cent CAGR of loan book growth in this segment on the back of SMEs expanding their export footprint, being hungry for working capital loans and expanding capacity. The book also remained remarkably resilient so far with net credit losses remaining below historical averages. A similar story played out in the MFI (microfinance) sector with robust growth and good quality books for most of the past 3 years. Since October last year, this story started to unravel with strain showing up in the MFI segment, which has only accelerated in the past two quarters. Q1 data shows there is now stress across the MFI sector in most of the states which has prompted the usual political moves of state governments barring financial institutions from collecting the dues (Karnataka and TN have passed laws on this). Yet, the SME sector was still going strong. Except Q1 showed signs of worry here too. Multiple NBFCs, most notably Bajaj Finance, the largest among them, called out stress they see across the board among SMEs. NBFCs are the largest lenders to this segment, filling up a gap left by universal banks because of a historical regulatory arbitrage that has somewhat evened out in the past few years. This SME segment stress seen by NBFCs could be a temporary blip, but loans don't go bad immediately, and most banks and NBFCs have a good set of lead indicators that give them a sense of how things will pan out for at least 2-3 forward quarters. Since they have called it out, my sense is we are at the beginning of a credit cycle in this segment for NBFCs. We will see credit drying up here as underwriting norms tighten to address this incipient stress. The 20+ per cent CAGR growth days might be ending here. The possible medium-term upside here is the FTAs that India has (almost) concluded with the EU and UK. Notwithstanding Trump's randomness, India should do its best to conclude the trade deal with the US and close others in the pipeline too. The SME segment has shown in the past 4 years that they have it in them to compete globally, despite the limited progress we have made on deregulations to help them.Lastly, the inflation print for June came in at a 77-month low of 2.1 per cent. This means there's more room for RBI to cut rates and my guess is if we continue to have inflation in sub 3 percent range and consumption remains weak, we will see one as early as October. But like I have mentioned above, the core thesis of rate cuts and injecting liquidity remains that the credit growth weakness is on account of supply of credit. I think this is partly true. Demand weakness is a reason too. Corporate credit growth is no longer dependent on repo rates as it used to be in the past. Most large corporations are at their lowest leverage ratios in the past two decades and their operating cash flows are higher than investing cash flows. The equity markets, which is where household savings are increasingly flowing, are still buoyant which is keeping equity capital cheap for corporations. The bond market continues to be strong and there's private credit also available. So, Bank loan rates are no longer a determinant for corporate credit needs. On retail credit, the credit bureau data suggests that the rate cuts and liquidity infused so far haven't led to higher enquiries for loans. Maybe there's a threshold after which the demand will show up. I still think the underlying sentiment is weak, which means even if there's a supply of credit, the demand won't pick up. Also, the signs of stress in SME and the existing stress in MFI and unsecured loans will lead to higher caution among lenders. All of the above indicate we might soon have a situation where financial institutions have excess liquidity with limited opportunities to deploy which is a different problem to contend with. But that's a distinct possibility.The way out of this is to navigate through the tariff wars with FTAs and concessions to key trading partners on our tariff rates and non-monetary barriers. This is a good time to make a case for it to the domestic constituency that likes the support of tariff barriers. The other long-pending area is to focus on deregulation on a war footing. There's been a statement of intent on this in the past year or so, but with insufficient follow-through. That remains the single biggest 'unlock' for growth if done with speed and purpose.Leave a commentIndia Policy Watch #2: City of JoyridesInsights on current policy issues in India—Pranay KotasthaneI spent most of my week in Kolkata as a tourist, visiting the city's iconic sights and food establishments. I had gone there to speak at The Conversation Room on all things public policy over great food and beer, a perfect setting to discuss the Indian State and its predicaments. Because what Oscar Wilde said about life—\"Life is too important to be taken seriously\"—applies equally to public policy. All first-time visitors to a new city instinctively start comparing the likeness and differences with the city where they live. And because the Indian State's omniabsence is unmistakable, the causes of city differences and likeness are often related to public policies. So here's one such account.The policy domain that struck me most was how Kolkata and Bengaluru handle urban transport. Of course, the most striking urban transport similarity between Kolkata and Bangalore is traffic jams everywhere. Travel times are high in both cities. The root causes, however, are pretty different. In Bengaluru, poor road design, potholes, wrong-side driving, and ill-maintained trunk roads are the main culprits. Conversely, in Kolkata, while trunk roads are generally well designed, the sheer diversity of vehicles and lack of technology like synchronised traffic signals seem to be the main reasons for the congestion. The presence of traffic police on Kolkata's streets was an order of magnitude higher than in Bengaluru, but there's only as much they could do without automated traffic flow handling. Now the differences. For someone coming from Bangalore, the diversity of vehicles in Kolkata is immediately noticeable. Kolkata has a metro system (India's oldest), local trains, ferry services, e-rickshaws (colloquially called Totos), flag-down taxis, bike taxis, all the major ride-sharing cab aggregators, along with Uber Shuttle, private buses, and government buses. There's also the colonial-era tram service, which now runs limited services on two routes and will wither away soon. On the outskirts, one can see autos (but plying as fixed-route shared transport) and the manually-propelled cycle rickshaws. This range of transport options available is quite remarkable compared to Bangalore's more limited choices.Given West Bengal's politics, I had imagined a government-run monopoly over Kolkata's public transport. But I was wrong. In Kolkata, I found three kinds of buses operating—government-run and government-operated buses, government-owned but privately-operated buses, and entirely private buses permitted to run on major routes. The state-run West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) website acknowledges the role private buses play as follows:Up to 1966-67 Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) nationalized about 90% of the City routes. After that CSTC could not sustain the increased passenger demands in the city mainly due to the financial constraints. Since then Government decided to allow private buses to operate in CSTC routes and areas.This contrasts sharply with Bangalore's BMTC monopoly, which is protected by not issuing stage carriage permits to private operators. This kind of permit allows buses to pick up and drop off passengers at different stops along a route, unlike a contract carriage permit, which only allows point-to-point operations. As a result, the only urban transport conversation in Bengaluru is about the number of buses BMTC can buy and put on the roads rather than about opening this sector to competition from private players. Of course, there are challenges with allowing private buses to operate. But public policy often involves making second-best choices. You can either have a small, reasonably well-run government-only bus system like in Bengaluru, which keeps failing to meet a city's growing demands. Or you could have numerous cheap shared transport options, albeit not always of the highest quality, like Kolkata does. Another difference is that Uber Shuttle is allowed in Kolkata but not in Bangalore for the same reasons as above. Successive Karnataka governments have been protecting a state-run monopoly at the cost of everyone else. Similarly, bike-taxis operate in Kolkata but are no longer allowed in Bengaluru.Regarding cab aggregators, it was interesting to note that Kolkata takes a more liberal approach to prices than Bangalore. Kolkata allows for capped surge pricing. Through a 2022 notification, cab aggregators can charge a fare 50 per cent lower than the base fare and a maximum surge pricing of 50 per cent above the base fare. Ride pooling is also allowed. In Bangalore, on the other hand, the state government has banned surge pricing, allowing charges in bands depending on the price of the vehicle. Nor is ride pooling permitted. These contrasts highlight that running a big urban centre well requires governments to make practical choices even if they don't fit neatly into political ideologies. All our cities need better urban transport, but Kolkata already has many building blocks of urban transport. This wasn't something I had expected as a tourist in the City of Joy.

We work hard and make sacrifices for our loved ones. We observe social norms and do what we can for our neighbours. And we respect the law, pay our taxes, and are willing to put more into the system knowing that others – our fellow citizens – may benefit more than we do. But we are not talking about a cold exchange of contracts. Identity, loyalty and citizenship are based on love – and a clearly recognised common culture.This is why so many modern political conceptions of identity fall short. Those intimidated by the relationship between history and today and between ethnic and civic conceptions of identity often like to say our British identity is about \"British values\". But while we might share some broad values, and reject others, this is of course nonsense. For in a large and complex society, the clash between different values and interests is never-ending. If we settle on those values about which we agree – democracy and the rule of law are usually given as examples – we would be no different to Belgium. And we are clearly not Belgium.The other way modern politicians obfuscate about identity is by claiming we have always been a \"country of immigration\", implying that our population has for a thousand years been in constant flux, and our true identity is about diversity and inclusivity. If this were true, we would be nothing more than a vacuum to be filled by others. And the claim is anyway quite obviously historically illiterate. Our population was, until Tony Blair, notable only for its stability. But since he was elected prime minister, there has been more immigration into Britain every single year than there was in the entire period from the Anglo-Saxons in the fifth and sixth centuries until the Second World War.The inconvenient truth about identity is that it is stronger when we know we have more things in common, and it is weaker when we have less. So radical diversity necessarily weakens our shared identity, and with it the reciprocity we anticipate and the willingness we have to do things for others. This should not be surprising, because a shared identity is what allows us to recognise familiarity in strangers – ultimately to the point that we are prepared to fight and die for them and the land we share.There is no single description of a national identity, but it is a complex mix of the places we have in common, our history and shared stories, institutions large and small, language, culture, and norms and rules that set out our expectations of decent behaviour. It is an organic thing, encompassing history, language, traditions, collective memories and shared places. Just as a family's identity is about memories and achievements and jokes and holidays and joy and arguments and tragedies and loss, so a national identity is formed along similar lines.This is why integration can be difficult even when it is what a newcomer and their family really want. But this prompts a different question. What if it is not what the newcomer and their family really want? What if rival identities and obligations make it difficult for a newcomer to embrace the responsibilities of British identity and citizenship? Read more",

SubStack CEO Chris Best <https://substack.com/@cb > gave a little talk. I took notes. He said the right things.I then took my notes and fed them into the skill-prompt I call \"thucydides-speech\" I have on my Dia Browser <http://diabrowser.com> installation. This is what came out:SubTuringChrisBestBot: What is the real engine of our shared endeavor? It is tempting, in an age of digital marvels, to attribute success to the cleverness of algorithms, the robustness of code, or the magnitude of capital investment. But such attributions, while comforting to the technocrat and the financier, miss the mark. The true foundation of Substack's vitality is not the machinery humming in the background, but the active engagement, criticism, and care of its users.Every bug report—no matter how minor—every complaint about statistics that refuse to align, every suggestion for improvement, these are not mere irritants, nor are they distractions from the \"real\" work of platform-building. On the contrary, they are the lifeblood of the collective project. Each is a signal, a pulse, a demonstration that the community is alive and alert, unwilling to accept mediocrity, and eager to shape the environment in which it dwells.I say this is not mere rhetoric. The platform's vitality depends, in the most literal sense, on the willingness of its writers and readers to invest not just their time, but their energy, and—dare I say it—their emotion, in making it better. If the users were to withdraw their attention, to resign themselves to passivity, the site would become a mausoleum of abandoned newsletters and silent comment sections. It is the ongoing, sometimes unruly, sometimes passionate, sometimes exasperated participation that keeps the platform alive.It is easy, in the age of scale and automation, to forget this. The myth persists that progress is a function of size, that the larger the network, the more inevitable the improvement. But the history of human endeavors—whether in Athens or in San Francisco—teaches us otherwise. The real engine of progress is the community itself: the people who show up, who argue, who demand better, who offer their labor and their criticism in equal measure.Substack's achievements—such as they are—derive not from a passive audience, but from a citizenry of active participants. You are not mere consumers, here to be fed content by invisible hands. You are the authors of posts, the sources of critique, the shapers of the ecosystem with every comment, every suggestion, every act of engagement. The platform's team is acutely aware of this; their appreciation is not a marketing ploy, but a recognition of dependence.Let us not deceive ourselves: the economics of digital platforms may be driven by network effects and economies of scale. These are the iron laws of the marketplace. But the soul of any platform—its animating principle—resides in the feedback loops of care, critique, and collaboration. Without these, there is only stagnation.The work is ongoing. Let us, then, continue as we have begun: active, critical, invested—not because it is easy, but because it is necessary for the health of the community, and for the promise of the project we have chosen to build together...Give a gift subscriptionAnd this is the \"thucydides-speech\" skill prompt:please take the highlighted bullet point notes and expand them into a talk, following the procedure of Thucydides: Since it is difficult to remember the exact words that were spoken, either those which one heard myself or those which were reported at second hand, the idea is to make the speakers say what, in your opinion, was called for by each situation, while keeping as closely as possible to the general sense of what was actually said.​Leave a commentWhat do I think of this?First, register this: These are not Chris Best's words. These are not Chris Best's thoughts. These are not, really, thoughts at all. These are a remix of sentence and paragraph fragments constructed by a new cultural summarization technology that presents you with a blurry jpeg of a fragment of the text of the internet. To the extent that there are ideas and thoughts behind these, they are the thoughts of the people who wrote the words on which the models have been trained, perhaps in a way similar to the way in which the motions of the character Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies are distorted reflections of the underlying motions of the actor Andy Serkis.Ascribe these to an entity of some sort I will call SubTuringChrisBestBot.And, well, it really does not sound much like Chris Best. It sounds more like Perikles of the Athenai, if he worked for a SOMA San Francisco startup today. (That is not necessarily bad.) And it does, I think, accurately convey the vibe I got from the event: that the writers on SubStack who showed up and the staff of SubStack who showed up are seriously invested in the project, as a way of pushing back against clickbait social-media shouting-class rage-engagement slop, and pushing for a rational, thoughtful infosphere of accurate information, rational discourse, and public reason. All are damned certain that they are not just hoping to do well but actively doing good.So I left more encouraged and hopeful about SubStack and its future than I had been before. Assibayah it has. Leave a commentSome More Stray Thoughts Gleaned from Conversations at the Event:Which may or may not be based in reality:Normalizing the \"tip jar\" is the key difference between SubStack and earlier weblogging efforts: that is the reason that one might hope that the SubStack information ecology will be stable and expanding long-term, while the weblogging information ecology was not.Front-line workers for SubStack have no idea what SubStack is going to do with its new money other then bank it and so extend the runway.But they do say that the newsletter-distribution-and-weblog-website-with-an-easily-tuneable-tip-jar core of the system makes figuring out what other surfaces they should work on a complex problem, and when they have to solve because they cannot lose their core identity without losing their essential mindshare edge as the central place to run a weblog in the 2020s.The problem of finding ways so that potential audience members can discover what SubStacks would enrich their lives is the central, largely unsolved one.In particular, adding any discovery layer within Substack that is more than rely on individual writer shout outs runs, very quickly, that any attempt to cast a broad net winds up, suggesting that people read either (a) writers who are very eager, for what seem like minor failures to toe some line, to drive others out in the wilderness to be food for Azazel; or (b) writers who are very eager to classify others as a blight on humanity who need to be removed from the gene pool, humanely (or not) not; or (c) both.The \"Nazi Bar\" problem is worse than the \"cancellation two-minute hate problem\", but both emerge remarkably quickly whenever you attempt a wide-net discovery layer that is anything other then a defensive crouch. The problem of figuring out how to balance capturing enough of the value-added for the true fans that writers can eat without destroying the usefulness of the SubStack for the non-true fans is the second, still largely unsolved one.And without free-subscriber non-true fans to serve as a SubStack's marketing department, the paid subscriber numbers will be astronomically unlikely to look good in the long run.The large free audience is not just an amplification play, but essential as the ground in which a healthy crop of paying subscribers can grow..The solutions? The line is that it lies in a combination of improved platform design, smarter algorithms, and the active cultivation of networks to connect the right readers with the right writers. But the confessed reality is that the strategy is to hire 100 people (so far), cook huge amounts of spaghetti, and throw it against the wall in clumps to see what sticks.Workers for SubStack are very curious about academic publishing—a system with a very broken business model but one in which there are a large group of people who are institutionally driven to write frantically, and then find some kind of audience.Is SubStack a way to shift from traditional academic publishing to the open web, fulfilling the university's mission?And nearly everyone at the event is firmly committed to the creation of a rational, accurate information- and analysis-full public sphere.The perennial questions about whether a 10% revenue cut can ultimately support a profitable business model.The belief that a company with only $45 million in current recurring annual revenue—and spending $20 million a year or more on its people—has any business raising $100 million, no matter how much of that is actually not just a 9% upside equity share but super-senior debt as well.A general belief that BOND, The Chernin Group, Andreessen Horowitz, Rich Paul, Jens Grede, Mood Rowghani, and the others are to some degree using this not as an investment so much as a public-relations reputation-washing effort, given some of the other things they have been doing.Lots of curiosity about Mood Rowghani.Substack's current structure is fundamentally a one-to-many broadcast model, centered on essays and newsletters. There is growing demand for more interactive, community-driven formats—such as live video and richer discussions—that existing technology does not yet fully support. And that raises all of the issues of para-sociality as applied to (very minor degrees of) celebrity.Navigating and surfacing meaningful content amid near-infinite digital \"noise\" is a persistent and growing challenge in the online information ecosystem, only growing larger with the tsunami of AI-slop now bearing down on us.Get 50% off a group subscriptionLeave a commentSubscribe nowIf reading this gets you Value Above Replacement, then become a free subscriber to this newsletter.

      "content": "PAN IV, 2023, by Ross SimoniniLast year, I developed the unexpected habit of blessing my phone. I now do this ritual any time I answer a call, send a text, or enter the drooling state of the scroll. I do it even if I'm not feeling particularly grateful for my device, because blessing isn't a way of worshipping technology—what many people are already, unknowingly doing—but the opposite: a method for transforming a false icon into a portal of possibility.I do not make a habit of blessing many things in my life, nor do I have a clear definition of the word bless, which I think of intuitively, unrelated to any specific spiritual doctrine. For me, a blessing is a concentrated feeling, an intensified internal attention. When I do it, I'm not asking for anything or hoping for an outcome; I'm just opening a space in my mind that, in my daily life, stays closed. After years of experimenting with many varieties of meditation and prayer, this is my best explanation of the phenomenon. To explain it under further scrutiny would betray its central mystery, which I don't want to do, because mystery is the nectar of my life. The important thing is, I know a blessing when I feel it, and it feels good.In the case of the phone, I began to notice that it had become a source of fiery, negative intensity in the world around me, and when I decided to quell this feeling, my natural response was a blessing. Some of this intensity came from within me, in the form of compulsion. It's a feeling I've endured with many things: food, people, and art—none of which are inherently corrupt, all of which can be addictive, and any of which might seem like a natural recipient of a blessing.But that was just the fingernail of the problem. Most of the conflict with this technology came from my community. Wherever I went, people cursed their phones. It was seeming fashionable to feel angsty about screen technology, even if you and everyone you knew used it constantly. I think people feel obligated to complain, as if it were their small, futile resistance to the phone's tyranny over our lives. Amongst my milieu, the phone became a villain, the leading culprit for asocial behavior, bullying, stupidity, depression, ADHD, totalitarianism, cancer, and climate change. In an interview on the Louisiana channel, the artist Cecily Brown said, \"The phone is obviously the death of art and culture.\"This is the Promethean tale of the evil phone, and while it contains validity, I am bored of it. For one thing, it's worth noting that this story is told most emphatically by people who have lived two lives: before and after phones. We who have seen across that divide are profoundly aware of our new phone reality. The past and future wrestle inside of us, and we can hardly stand it.Those born later—the native-phone generations—will likely let go of this struggle. When I was young, my parents wrung their hands over my TV time, believing its screen would melt my eyes and brain. Before that, electricity, radio, cars and books all inspired similar debates. Before that, Plato believed writing would destroy our minds—now it is the standard measure of academic intelligence. Civilization was flawed long before any of these technologies and it will continue to be long after they are obsolete.But for a moment, imagine the phone is irredeemably evil. It's been corrupted by corporations and governments. It's eroding away our thoughts, feelings, desires, and human connection. Humanity's downfall is in our pocket. If these dangers are all true, then a blessing seems more necessary than ever. Turning a blind eye to such an enormous threat and defenestrating the phone—this would be an act of fear and cowardice.Of course, I too feel some disgust and unease about the smartphone, but where I used to complain, I now harness these feelings in my blessing. As Matthew said in the Bible, \"Bless those that curse you, do good to those that hate you.\" For real change, we must find the sacred inside of the phone's darkness. This is how we become a more mindful steward of our technology.Consider the philosophy of Tantra, a word that translates to \"technology.\" In Tantric Hinduism, all the traditional sins—sex, red meat, alcohol, morbidity—become tools for connecting to God. Instead of avoiding sex, bring such a high quality of attention to the act that it becomes prayer. Instead of abstaining from alcohol and drugs, imbibe intoxicants until you master their slippery ways. Instead of ignoring death, live in a graveyard and drink from the skull of a corpse, as is practiced by the monastic order of the Aghori.If the phone is now a symbol for the profane, it is also a profound site of the sacred. The act of real power is to transform it into something that can support us. The crucifix was once a symbol for pain and wickedness, but the Christians turned it into an engine for divinity. Praying to the crucifix is not an endorsement of torture or cross-makers, but an act of love. Every path leads to grace when you walk it correctly. My Whole Entiled World performance, 2018, Forestville, CA.When I bless my phone, I take a brief moment of pause before my mind drops into cellular fixation. I begin by opening up what I want to feel—gratitude, empathy—and I just stay with it for a moment. Then I remind myself of this object's miraculous capabilities, complicated potential, and even the dubious radiation it emits. Now, I keep a folded swatch of electromagnetic-blocking faraday fabric in my bag, placed between my body and the phone, as a sign that I acknowledge and respect its volatile energy.Yet, with all its threats in mind, I have still decided that the phone improves my life more than it impairs it. I'm not getting rid of it, and when I look around, it seems that most of the detractors have come to the same conclusion.Still, the story of the sinful phone now lives in my blood, forever keeping me weary and vigilant against its charisma. This might be a good thing, but in what ways has the guilty weight of this narrative prevented me from using my phone well?What happens when we refer to the phone as an extension of ourselves while simultaneously condemning it? After all, this is the device that I use to speak to my favorite people, to look at pictures of my daughter, to make and orchestrate various forms of art—all the things I care most about in life. Worse yet, if we believe the phone as a site of all the monstrosities in culture—social media, news headlines, porn—do we all turn more monstrous when we enter its blue-lit space? The way dark, sordid bars give people permission to do what broad daylight does not.We spend hours stroking our phones, showing them the kind of attention that babies and pets usually receive. In moments of suffering, we are thankful for whatever relief they give us, through a meme or message or music. We crave this kind of intimate phone time. It puts our mind into the standby state of beta, which is as necessary as delta (sleep), gamma (insight), theta (meditation) or alpha (daydream).Yet many categorize this time as distraction, which is one of the greatest sins in neoliberal capitalism, where a human's value is defined by our productivity. Personally, I need distraction. As an artist, I discover inspiration through aimlessly following pleasure. Of course, I have experienced acedia, lost in the apathy of unfocused exploration, but mostly, distraction has served me well.As a child I used the encyclopedia for this purpose, and my parents encouraged my hours of turning pages. Despite Plato, they believed the book to be a beneficial technology. But now, the same activity on our phone—clicking through the hyperlinks of Wikipedia—is perceived as a waste of time. Flipping through dusty crates in an old record store is a romantic way to spend an afternoon, but discovering the strange, unheard corners of Spotify is culturally vapid.I'm saying all of this not to defend the phone, nor to encourage phone use—especially not for children—but to point out the ways in which our narrative of the phone colors all its activities, regardless of what they might be.I began blessing my phone in the fall, and in the winter, I lost my home, my art studio and everything I owned in the Los Angeles fires. I evacuated my house with an armload of objects, one of which was my phone, and in many ways, it saved me.Over the following months, the amount of generosity and kindness that poured through that device was, next to my family, the greatest source of love in my life. Of course, it wasn't the phone loving me, it was the people—and yet, I cannot think of a real-world analog for the mobile's flavor of human connection. In the pits of my post-fire darkness, I would have been exhausted by a queue of well-wishers at my doorstep; but receiving texts, emails, and calls was the ideal form of passive communication for that moment. I could respond at the lugubrious pace of disaster recovery, without licking a stamp or even looking presentable.I do believe that blessing my phone made some of this possible. It allowed me to scrape away a little plaque of phone sin and perceive the support I needed in a time of despair. Because of that, I now have palpable experiences I can call upon to uphold my ritual.Since then, the feelings in my blessing are deeper and easier to access. The whole process has become increasingly natural, almost reflexive. Sometimes, I'm not even aware I'm doing it. Over time, perhaps the phone (or any object of a blessing) becomes irrelevant and my habit becomes an orientation toward the world. That sounds like a nice outcome.So far, this practice has helped to keep me in a state of astonishment with the phone. As someone who lived in pre-phone reality, I still regard this device as some kind of bizarre magic, and I'd like to hold onto that disbelief. Any one of us is lucky to own what billions of people cannot. We are wielders of power and we should hold ourselves accountable for using it well.The Buddhists emphasize that we live through right action, right speech, and right view. These values are not just for easy days, but are most useful in the times of overwhelm or mundanity. If we find ourselves thoughtless and reactive with our devices in hand, then we are in a ripe state for contemplation. If the phone is our new window into reality, then through it we can revere everything.Subscribe now",

The large systems in which houses are embedded try to prevent and resist such decay modes, but even so such modes still happen at times.When our bodies get sick they are in decay modes, modes we try to prevent and resist. But even when not sick, our bodies are mostly in a slow overall decay mode of aging. As are typically our houses, cars, and organizations.Science and business seem to be improving, not decaying, even as individual scientists and business firms decay. But in history whole empires not only fell into fast temporary decay modes like famines and pandemics, they also typically entered slow decay modes, and went away. You might hope that empires just rose more slowly than rivals, and so were displaced, but its seems that, no, empires mostly decayed from within.Firms decay even though they have internal processes of innovation and improvement, and entire biological species have also decayed, even though they have internal innovation driven by natural selection.Mars and Venus may have once harbored life, which was destroyed when those whole planets drifted into decay modes. Planetary decay modes may be a big part of the great filter that explains why there are so few planets with life as advanced as ours.Humanity has pioneered a new form of natural selection on Earth: cultural evolution. This has powered our rapid and large rise, unprecedented compared to other animals. But even natural selection as a system is capable of falling into decay modes. Which we seem to have done over the last few centuries. Powerful success at innovating tech and business practices has led to wealth and much easier talk, trade, and travel, which has greatly weakened cultural evolution at the macro culture level. We now have far weaker selection pressures are, and far faster change in the adaptive target which evolution needs to track. What were once hundreds of thousands of peasant cultures have merged into a monoculture encompassing most of the world. Furthermore, we have drifted into a mode where we celebrate the cultural activists who cause rapid culture change largely random relative to adaptive pressures.Thankfully a few subcultures, like the Amish and Haredim, seem likely to resist being merged into our monoculture, so they can save humanity from extinction. But there will be great hell to pay before that recovery.Decay modes are quite common in all types of systems. Natural selection tends to evolve systems that try to resist internal decay modes. But our most basic systems of natural selection are themselves systems that can fall into decay modes. From which maybe only luck can save us.",

      "content": "Before you are prejudiced, please note your answers to the following question. @hat is your credence that the physical constants are necessary, e.g. that there is no possible world with the same laws of physics as ours except where the fine-structure constant has a different value than it does? Write it down, or leave it in a comment before liking and smashing that subscribe button. So, the fine-tuning argument for the existence of God. Read this post if you're unfamiliar with it. In sum, it works as follows. Supposedly, there are various physical constants such that, if they were just a tiny bit different, life in this universe would be impossible. Moreover, there is little to no a priori reason to suspect these values for the constants are especially likely—the only thing special about the values is that they allow for the existence of life, and the probability of the constants having sufficiently close values to what they do is super duper tiny. So, conditional on their being no God (and no other perhaps impersonal force that prefers the existence of life), it seems super unlikely that life would exist. Conditional on God, though, maybe it's still unlikely material life would exist, but not as unlikely. Therefore, the existence of life in our universe is strong Bayesian evidence for God. Lots of different numbers show up for how unlikely fine-tuning would be depending on which constants are under discussion, so let's say that the probability of getting fine-tuned constants by chance is something like 10-30, which seems representative for what the proponents of this argument claim. Actually, proponents often boast much smaller probabilities; but 10-30 will be small enough for our purposes. As I suggested, there are views other than theism that might predict fine-tuning, like axiarchism, the idea that things are the way they are simply because it is good that they are this way (but not through the actions of a God). To simplify the discussion, I will ignore those hypotheses and pretend the only hypotheses at play are theism and normal, naturalistic, Richard Dawkins-style atheism. When I say \"If God doesn't exist...,\" note that I am saying \"If store-brand naturalistic atheism is true....\" You may replace \"God\" with \"God, or the Good, or whatever else is the kind of thing that might orient the universe towards life.\" So, to formalize, let G be the proposition that God exists, and let F be the proposition that the constants are fine-tuned for life. Then we have:(if you do not understand this formula, then give me money to learn the Way of Bayes. Or use your free trial. Or read the Wikipedia article for Bayes' theorem.)The quantity on the left is how likely theism is compared to atheism given fine-tuning (the posterior odds). The first factor on the right is how much theism predicts fine-tuning compared to atheism (the likelihood ratio). The second factor on the right is how likely God's existence is compared to atheism before taking fine-tuning into account (the prior odds). Now, maybe you find theism super duper implausible a priori. Maybe it has, like, a one in a million chance of being true before we look at the empirical evidence. Or surely, at least, a 1 in 1010 probability. As for P(F|G)? Maybe you think the only reason we think theism predicts fine-tuning is that we're biased in favor of thinking God would totally want to create us, biased perhaps by the narratives of popular religions. Maybe he'd only probably only create angels, or something. But surely there is at least a 1 in a million chance he would want to create life like us? Or at least 1 in 1010? Finally, there is P(F|~G). This will be one of the tiny numbers that theists boast about how unlikely for the constants to be what they are assuming a naturalistic world—10-30, we are supposing. Therefore, we haveThat is, given these numbers, given that we observe fine-tuning, God existing is 1010 times more likely than not. So if the argument works, you should take fine-tuning to be incredibly strong evidence for God! If you think even 10-10 is an implausibly large estimate for the two quantities, I think you are probably overconfident or scope-insensitive, but I also remind you that the fine-tuning proponents often boast much smaller numbers than 10-30, and you should look at their arguments in more detail. For today, let us suppose that almost everything about the fine-tuning argument works: there really is fine-tuning, the values of constants we observe are super unlikely on naturalism, even compared to the prior odds of God existing and of him fine-tuning the universe for life. Today, I discuss just one objection: what if the physical constants are necessary? What if alpha, the fine-structure constant, just could not have been anything else, and a more developed physical theory will reveal this fact? Then, it may seem, the probability of the constants being what they are given naturalism will be 1, so fine-tuning is no longer comparatively likely given God's existence. The standard response to this objection is that this is a Bayesian argument. The probabilities above are meant to reflect our uncertainty, not any kind of objective likelihood. Water is H2O,1 and this fact is metaphysically necessary, but my confidence that water is H2O is not 1; maybe the scientists are drastically mistaken, or I am misremembering what I learned, etc. Or at the very least, a few hundred years ago, a reasonable person's confidence that water is H2O would not even be close to 1. Yet it was still just as metaphysically necessary; it was of the essence of water to be H2O before anyone knew so. It is the degree of uncertainty that the fine-tuner cares about, not anything else. I will get to why I ultimately think \"The constants could be necessary\" is a bad objection, but I don't think the standard response works (and, do note, that the standard response doesn't work is my only thesis for this post). For while it is true that the constants being necessary doesn't change the prior (low) probability that they are what they have to be for life to exist, it does change the relevant relationships of evidential dependence, such that if the constants are necessary, then the fine-tuning argument doesn't work. E is said to be evidence for H if the probability of H given E is greater than the prior probability of H. Formally: P(H|E) > P(H). A proposition S is said to screen out the evidence E for H provided that learning S would make E no longer evidence for (or against) H. Formally: S screens outs the evidence E for H provided that P(H|E) > P(H) but P(H|E,S) = P(H|S). For example, it being Spring is evidence that my car is wet, since it rains more in the Spring. But if I learn that it did in fact rain today, then its being Spring is no longer evidence for or against my car being wet. (Intuitively: learning whether it's raining already subsumes all the evidence I'd get for my car being wet from the season). Therefore, the evidential dependence between the season and my car's wetness is screened out by my observation that it is raining. Learning that it is raining destroys the ability of the season to be evidence for or against my car's wetness. Let us suppose that an oracle tells us that N = the constants are metaphysically necessary as the atheist alleges, just as it is metaphysically necessary 1+1=2. Let us, now, take the our two pieces of evidence—fine-tuning and the necessity of the constants—into account at the same time, and see how they bear on God's existence. We have: This is a point where I might be making an oversight, but it seems to me that whether God exists, by itself, has little evidential bearing on whether the physical constants are metaphysically necessary, just like how, if an oracle told me whether God exists or not would not, I don't think I'd very much change my credence in the proposition that 1+1=2, water is H2O, two things can't be in the same place at the time time, etc. are metaphysically necessary.2 Therefore, I assume the middle term on the right is 1. Please push back if that assumption seems unjustified. We have, then, thatAs before, I assume the prior odds of God's existence are not super extreme. Maybe you find it a priori very unlikely, but I doubt it's anything like 10-30 unlikely. What is P(F|N,G)? This is where things get interesting. I claim that this quantity is simply equal to P(F|N): the probability that the metaphysically necessary values of the constants, whatever that may be, turn out to be the fine-tuned ones that allow for life. Intuitively, I think this is true because, on the assumption that the constants are necessary, God cannot control their values.3 The reason that, forgetting about the necessity of the constants, fine-tuning is more expected on God's existence is because it is not-insanely-unlikely that God desires to create a physical universe fine-tuned for life. But if the constants are metaphysically necessary, then God's desires would have no influence on their values, and indeed not be evidence regarding their values.4 Don't get me wrong, P(F|N) still seems insanely low. Whatever deeper physical or mathematical truths render the constants necessary, it seems like they would have no regard for the existence of life, so it would seem like a metaphysical miracle that the necessary values of the constants just happens to fall in the tiny range that allows for life. But my claim, here, is simply that P(F|N,G) = P(F|N). For the same reasons, it seems that P(F|N,~G) = P(F|N). Perhaps there are some deeper physical or mathematical truths such that, once we discover them, we'll see alpha just had to have the value it actually does. But it doesn't seem like learning God doesn't exist would change your credence that, given that the constants are necessary, they have the fine-tuned values, since presumably whatever process or theoretical results the atheist imagines that explains the necessary values of the constants isn't sensitive to God's existence. Like how the mathematical explanation for why the 100th digit of e is 7 will give the same answer regardless of whether God exists. Recall our previous formula for the odds of God's existence given fine-tuning and the necessity of the constants: If I am right that P(F|N,G) = P(F|N) and P(F|N,~G) = P(F|N), then the likelihood ratio is 1, and then this reduces toOr, in other words, the odds of God existing given fine-tuning and the necessity of the constants is just whatever you originally thought the odds of God's existence were before. This is to say, if you already believed that the constants are necessary, then observing fine-tuning doesn't give you evidence for God relative to your prior probability. The argument can be made more cleanly. The claim that fine-tuning in conjunction with the necessity of the constants don't provide evidence for God is justThis, in turn, follows from two assumptions (check my work): (1) states that learning that God exists doesn't give evidence for or against the constants being necessary. This can be doubted for the reasons described in footnote 3, but when it comes to the atheist who says \"the constants might be necessary,\" I have in mind someone who thinks a deeper theoretical explanation (and nothing referring to the choice of God) will show the constants have to be what they are, like how deeper theoretical explanations show that c2 = 1/μ0ε0. If we have in mind this sort of hypothesis when we refer to N, then (1) seems true by comparison to similar cases. (2) is what I argued for with the control argument. Given that the constants are necessary in the way the atheist imagines, God's existence would be no evidence for or against the constants being fine-tuned. For, again, the reason we have an evidential dependence between God and fine-tuning is because we expect a not-super-tiny probability that God would want a fine-tuned universe. But conditional on the constants being necessary, he cannot control their values, and so God desiring a fine-tuned universe is not evidence for the constants being fine-tuned. The conclusion is: if an oracle were to tell us that the constants are necessary in the relevant manner, then the fine-tuning argument would not work. We don't have oracles, but if you find a really good reason to think the constants are necessary, then that should correspondingly diminish the compelling of the fine-tuning argument. Richard Dawkins will read this (I am very famous) and then cry tears of joy. \"Aha! I can just believe the constants are necessary, and then defeat the fine-tuning argument!\" Not so fast, bucko. Here's an important point: as far as our subjective uncertainty goes, going from our prior probability (so, before we know about fine-tuning), it seems like whether the constants are necessary will be evidentially independent of whether they're fine-tuned. If you're Boltzmann brain suddenly popping into existence who doesn't know physics and who also hasn't observed the physical world, and then an oracle tells you that the universe is fine-tuned and God doesn't exist (and all the other non-naturalistic life-oriented hypothesis are false), your reaction wouldn't be \"Hm, guess the constants are necessary.\" No, you'd think a massive and lucky coincidence happened, and your consequence that a lucky metaphysical coincidence happened would not increase. Indeed, from (1) and (2) above, it follows thatand from this it follows thatConsider the fraction in the last line. Unless you think there is some particular reason why we should a priori expect why constants in a godless universe are more likely to be fine-tuned for life than metaphysically necessary constants, that fraction is no less than one. Indeed, I would say it's equal to 1: both the probability distribution of possible constants conditional on the constants (whatever they are) being necessary and the distribution conditional on atheism are both just whatever that distribution is when we ignore the influence of any entity that can cause the universe to be hospitable to life. The constants in a godless universe and those in a universe with constants necessitated by deeper physical truths are equally indifferent to life. Nevertheless, if the fraction is no less than 1, we haveThis means that, if you are an atheist hearing the fine-tuning argument for the first time—even if you're super confident God doesn't exist—you should not react by raising your confidence that the constants are necessary while maintaining your confidence God doesn't exist. Even though it is true that if the constants are necessary then the fine-tuning argument does not work, that does not mean fine-tuning is evidence that the constants are necessary, even if you go in super confident that God doesn't exist. So you should only reject the argument on these grounds if you antecedently thought the constants are likely to be necessary. Unfortunately, at the beginning of this post, I tricked you into admitting that your antecedent confidence in that claim is low, and if you try to go back on that, I will Dutch Book you into oblivion. Okay, this is a small point, so who cares? The objection people say doesn't work doesn't work. Well, I have a secret reason for wanting to write this. There are a lot of these Bayesian-type arguments for God, of the form \"The universe is fortunate in these super-duper-unlikely ways, but they are not super-duper-unlikely conditional on God, so we have strong evidence for God.\" And I have a suspicion that the analogue of \"What if the constants are necessary\" actually works in some other cases. I suspect it works in the case of the argument from psychophysical harmony, as I have high antecedent confidence that it is metaphysically impossible that anyone in my physical state has a different mental state from me. But you will have to wait for a future post. Anyway, the takeaway: I don't think \"The constants might be necessary\" is a good response to the Fine-Tuning Argument, since the constants probably aren't necessary (physicists can chime in here, but my impression is that the specifics of our world will probably still be due to free parameters in a more complete theory). But you should not reply to this objection by saying \"This is about epistemic possibility, not metaphysical possibility, so the necessity of the constants makes no difference.\" As far as I can tell, you either have to address whether the constants are in fact necessary, or say something more complicated like what is addressed below. You can stop reading here unless you are starving for an extra helping of philosophy. I got some nice comments on the above from Joe Schmid of the amazing YouTube channel The Majesty of Reason, and I should reply to them here. First, let us consider two analogous arguments to the Fine-Tuning Argument. The first is what I will call the \"Flo-Tuning Argument\", and the second was called the \"Awesome Theological Argument\" by Luke Barnes. The Flo-Tuning Argument: Flo noticed that if you multiply μ0 (the strength of the magnetic force) by ε0 (the strength of the electrical force), you get units of one over velocity squared. So Flo picked her favorite velocity, the speed of light c, and calculated the dimensionless quantity φ = c2μ0ε0, which she dubbed \"Flo's constant.\" What's more, she proved that if φ where even a tiny bit off from the value it actually has, all sorts of catastrophe would result and life would be impossible. Therefore, she reasoned, it is likely that the value of φ was fine-tuned by God. So, I think the Flo-Tuning Argument is not good, even if we grant that life would be impossible if φ had a slightly different value. The reason is that φ is equal to exactly 1, and it had to be that way given how physics works. Taking Maxwell's equations you can deduce that the electric and magnetic fields form a wave, and the velocity of the resulting wave is the square root of 1/μ0ε0. But an electromagnetic wave is just what light is, so the speed of light is given by c2 = 1/μ0ε0, so φ = 1. Sure, if you make an assumption that violates the laws of physics, maybe you can prove from that that life would be impossible5—that is not a surprising result, and so we should not feel lucky or surprised that φ = 1. I bring this up because this sort of thing is what I have in mind with the atheist who supposes the values of the constants are necessary, though necessary in a less obvious way than above. The Awesome Theological Argument: One night, the stars in the sky seem to miraculously spell out the entire Prologue to the Gospel of John in Koine Greek. Everyone sees this, and the event is confirmed by all astronomical measurements, so the idea of it being a wide group hallucination is ruled out. Such an event is extremely unlikely on naturalism, but not extremely unlikely on theism, so the event provides strong evidence for theism.I take it that the Awesome Theological Argument is good—or at least, it would be good if the relevant events actually happened. Sure, we could argue about whether it really proves God exists; maybe demons or aliens or our simulators are trying to trick us. But such an event would certainly be strong evidence for the existence of God. The reason people like to bring up the Awesome Theological Argument is because a lot of objections to the Fine-Tuning Argument also rule the former out. \"God's existence does not have a well-defined prior probability\"; if such a point rules out the Fine-Tuning Argument, it also rules out the commonsense reasoning \"The stars spelling out the Gospel of John is a lot more likely if God exists, so this seems to be evidence God exists.\" \"The constants might be necessary\"; if someone concluded it might be metaphysically necessary that the stars are arranged just as they are, that would seem to be an ad hoc refusal to confront the evidence. The lesson: if you have an objection to fine-tuning, make sure it doesn't also rule out the cases that would most obviously count as evidence for the existence of God. We'll get back to the Awesome Theological Argument and the Flo-Tuning Argument. A very important point that Joe raises is that even if you come in with antecedently high confidence that the constants are necessary, the datum of fine-tuning might count as evidence against the constants being necessary. He gives a fun analogy demonstrating why this would be reasonable: Here's an analogy. We've heard about large rocks on No Name Island. No one in our community knows for sure whether they're movable, as none of us has ever been there to confirm with certainty. We've just heard various testimonial reports of varying quality from others outside our community. Some philosophers in our community hypothesize that the rocks are really just large outgrowths of the mountain underneath and so are immovable by humans. Other philosophers hypothesize that the rocks are instead boulders that could be moved by humans cooperating to push them around. You, Flo, are the foremost philosophical proponent of the immovable rocks hypothesis, pointing to the solid testimony in its favor from several reputable sources. But suppose you accompany me as we travel for the first time to No Name Island. As we're about to land, we see from our helicopter those large rocks arranged to spell out \"Welcome to No Name island! Enjoy your stay :)\".Clearly, the arrangements of the rocks is so arbitrary from a natural point of view that we should conclude they are not immovable and that humans arranged them to be as they are. Sure, if an oracle told us the rocks were immovable with credence 1, the strange pattern of the rocks would no longer be evidence that they were fine-tuned by humans. But we do not assign probability 1 to immovable rocks, and it seems on any reasonable priors the observation will be strong evidence against immovable rocks. This is compatible with the letter of what I argued: conditional on necessity of the constants, fine-tuning is not evidence for God. But conditional on our actual evidence, including our uncertainty of the necessity of the constants, fine-tuning might be evidence that the constants aren't necessary and thereby count as evidence for God, even if you come in with high confidence that the constants are necessary. So the atheist is in a worse position than even I suggested above. It seems to me that, in the case of fine-tuning, Joe is right. The possibility of large-scale complex structures, let alone life, is arbitrary from the point of view of fundamental physics, so having constants fine-tuned for such seems to be strong evidence that the constants are not necessary (not that I, personally, needed that evidence). But I must say I am not confident in this verdict, in particular when it comes to the Flo-Tuning Argument. I do not see what applies in the case of the fine-structure constant that does not apply to φ.6 I get the sense that if we really saw how the constants are necessary (assuming such is true), and we could see that they had to be what they are to the same extent that we can see φ has to be exactly 1, then we would no longer find the reasoning under the supposition that the constants are different to be particularly meaningful. As far as things seem to me, the reason it seems like fine-tuning is evidence against necessary constants just reduces to incredulity at the idea of their not being free parameters (or derivable from other free parameters). Justified incredulity, I think, but I don't know if the considerations here should move the atheist who for some reason really expects we'll fine more fundamental reasons for the values of the constants along the lines of why φ = 1. So, I suppose, I might need help from a reader in identifying what might make the Flo-Tuning case non-representative. Joe gives another reply to me, arguing that even conditional on the necessity of the constants, we expect a higher chance of the constants being what they are conditional on theism (note he said these things in the context of the psychophysical harmony argument, so I have made the relevant substitutions): I've been toying with the thought that even if God doesn't have control over the [values of the constants] due to their necessity, their [fine-tuned] character can still significantly favor theism over naturalism. The (rough) reason is that, on theism, it's not super-duper unlikely that many necessary truths are somehow grounded in, dependent on, or explained ultimately by God's perfect essence....And even if these claims have a low probability conditional on theism (which will result in a low probability of [fine-tuning] conditional on theism), I suspect that it won't be overwhelmingly, fantastically low — which is arguably how likely [fine-tuning] is on naturalism (even supposing that, whatever the laws happen to be, they're necessarily that way, which doesn't boost the probability of their having any particular character). So, if we follow this line of thought, [fine-tuning] can still be serious evidence for theism even if the [values of the constants] are necessary.My reply here is similar. It seems unlikely that, if it were shown that φ not being 1 would lead to catastrophe, this would give us evidence that Maxwell's equations reflect God's nature. If there is a disanalogy here with the fine-structure constant, then again, I will need help from the reader to find it. Perhaps what is going on is this. A possibility I have been supposing is that, in the case where a constant is necessary, assuming it has something other than its necessary value could be shown to lead to catastrophe. Again, if I am wrong about this in the case of e.g. φ, then please correct me (I only have a fake undergrad degree in physics). But assume this is so. Then finding out that some constant having a different value would be catastrophic would, I think, be good evidence that its value its necessary, like how φ = 1 is necessary. More generally, it seems apparently-fine-tuned constants would be evidence that either they are arbitrary parameters set by God or they are necessary. If it turns out that assuming φ is not 1 could not plausibly be shown to lead to catastrophic consequences, then I wholly concede Joe's argument in the case of fine-tuning. Lastly, Joe rightly asks me to consider what I say in the case of the Awesome Theological Argument, the case where the prologue of the Gospel of John is written in the stars. What I say is this. The sort of necessity the atheist envisions when they suppose the constants are necessary is similar to that which explains why φ = 1. So if we supposed that we found out that the writing in the stars is similarly necessary—that is, we have deep theoretical reason showing it had to be the case, enough that we would expect the prologue of John to be written in the stars even conditional on atheism or Islam being true—then, yeah, it seems like the writing in the stars wouldn't be evidence for God/Christianity anymore. Our justified incredulity that there could ever be a case where the writing in the stars isn't evidence for God seems to reduce to justified incredulity that we could find out that such an arrangement of the stars is necessary in the required manner; such incredulity does not seem to reflect what counts as evidence for God conditional on finding deeper theoretical explanation for why things have to be the way they are. One way we can compare the two cases is as follows. If a genius physicist came along and purported to show that the writing in the stars is as necessary as that φ = 1 and is to be expected even conditional on atheism, I don't think I could ever become convinced he didn't screw up somewhere. But if a genius physicist came along and showed that a physical constant has to be what it is just as φ had to be 1, it wouldn't take much after that for me to be convinced that he's right. I think, ultimately, what I want to say about the Fine-Tuning Argument stands. The atheist who supposes the constants are necessary cannot be replied to by simply saying he's confusing metaphysical and epistemic possibility, since in fact the necessity of the constants would screen the evidential connection between fine-tuning and God. But the atheist cannot get out of the argument in this manner unless he had an antecedently high confidence that the constants are necessary, before seeing the fine-tuning argument. Indeed, based on what Joe said, it seems pretty likely that fine-tuning should actually decrease his confidence in such a claim. What does this say about psychophysical harmony? We will have to wait. 1I know what many will say in response to this example, and I do not negotiate with terrorists. 2I do not claim that all statements of metaphysical necessity would be largely unaffected. For example, if I learned with credence 1 that God exists, I would become highly confident that God necessarily exists. But the case of the constants seems more like the 1+1=2 case. 3The control argument was briefly brought up by Brian Cutter in this interview (at about 1:03:00) on the argument from psychophysical harmony (thanks to Joe Schmid for this reference). Cutter replies that, in order for necessity to screen out evidence for God, we would have to be essentially certain of the necessity claim, which seems unreasonable. Why would we need near-certainty? The idea is that, given the four hypotheses (concerning the existence of God and the necessity claim), only God + contingency doesn't have a teeny tiny probability of getting psychophysical harmony/fine-tuning. This is essentially the same as the point Joe gave to me, that fine-tuning is evidence against the necessity of the constants. I'll talk about that later. But what is important is that, assuming the reply made by Cutter works, we cannot reply to the atheist who brings up the necessity claim by saying \"That only concerns metaphysical possibility, but the argument only talks about epistemic possibility,\" which Cutter did briefly before the control argument was addressed. You'd need to address how well no God + necessity predicts the relevant datum. (In the case of psychophysical harmony, I must admit, my prior probability conditional on a posteriori physicalism that intrinsically-undesirable-feelings will correlate with avoidance-behavior etc. is pretty high. But that is a matter for another post). 4I should be careful here. It is not unreasonable to think: \"God's existence is metaphysically necessary. God necessarily desires to create the best of all possible worlds, since he is necessarily good. Therefore, the features of our world in virtue of which it is the best—including fine-tuning—are metaphysically necessary. Yet they are still only necessary because they depend on what God necessarily desires. In particular, learning God's desires will be evidence for how the world necessarily is.\" In reply, I assume that conditional on God's existence, some thing are necessary because of God's necessary choices, and some things are necessary irrespective of God's choice. In the latter category, I believe we have things like 1+1=2. I take N to be the proposition that the constants are necessary in that latter sense; this is in fact what the atheist has in mind when they say \"Maybe the constants are necessary.\" Now, if you're one of the kinds of theist who think the second category of necessary truths isn't real—if you, like Descartes, believe that God created the laws of mathematics and even logic—then I have to concede that nothing in this post should be persuasive to you, and the truth of your position would be enough to rebut the atheist. This is, from my understanding, a relatively marginal view, which doesn't mean it's wrong, but it does make me comfortable to limit my scope in this post. 5Perhaps I am overestimating how likely it is such an argument could be made. If any physicists want to weigh in and tell me \"There's no way assuming that φ isn't 1 would lead to the sorts of conclusions people make about the constants in the Fine-Tuning Argument,\" please do!6One thing to note is that 1 is a much more natural value than the value of the fine-structure constant, so we have a reasonable high a priori probability that a given dimensionless constant will be 1. We could even imagine physicists inferring that there must be some principled reason for φ to be exactly 1, even before going through the reasoning. But—and I could be wrong here, so again, please correct me if you're a physicist—I think I could have chosen an example with a less-obviously-natural value than 1, indeed perhaps with a level of naturalness that could plausibly be had by e.g. the fine-structure constant.",

      "content": "Once upon a time, there existed a set of journals that published lots of fiction and were extremely popular. They were printed on slick, glossy paper and for this reason they were known as 'the slicks'. These journals often had circulations in the millions, and they paid thousands of dollars per story—You could become a rich man or women just by writing for these journals.But what kinds of stories did these journals publish? Well, the natural temptation is for us to believe that they published the kinds of highbrow mid-twentieth century writers that we've heard of: J.D. Salinger, John Cheever, John Updike, Grace Paley, etc.However, although these writers sometimes placed a few stories in these journals, they generally published their work in higher-brow periodicals—Harper's, The New Yorker, and The Atlantic—that had lower circulations and paid less.So the question remains: what was happening in the high-circulation fiction journals known colloquially as 'the slicks'? What exactly was in them? Who were they publishing? Well, for the last month I've been investigating that question. When I talk about the slicks, I'm talking about a set of magazines like American, McCall's, Collier's, Lady's Home Journal, Redbook, and The Saturday Evening Post. From about the 1910s through the 1970s, these were the most popular magazines in America. The Saturday Evening Post was the most popular of these journals: it had the highest circulation of any magazine in America from about 1910 to 1965. At its peak, it had a circulation of eight million, dwarfing even the largest pulps.1And yet, compared to the pulps, it is relatively difficult to get information about these journals. When you're looking into pulp fiction, a Google search will reveal that H.P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard are the quintessential Weird Tales writers. Similarly, Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler were the quintessential Black Mask writers. At a remove of a hundred years, these are the writers that are held up as exemplars of these journals: representatives of the best of what they were attempting to do.For The Saturday Evening Post, there is one name that is similar: F. Scott Fitzgerald. He published many of his best-known stories in The Post, including his most famous (\"Babylon, Revisited\"). My understanding is that during the 1920s, the Post had a period when it was a bit edgier and flirted with more ambiguous, self-consciously aesthetized stories, and it was during this period when Fitzgerald broke in.However, they also published other writers whose reputation has endured. The Post published sixteen stories by William Faulkner, and it published a number of other well-known writers. They published a lot of P.G. Wodehouse. They were the first U.S. publisher (in serial form) for Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile. They were the initial home for many of the essays in Joan Didion's Slouching Toward Bethlehem. They published some of Ray Bradbury's better-known stories.There is definitely a tale to be told about The Saturday Evening Post, and its role in 20th-century literature. But I don't know that anyone has actually bothered to tell it. I feel like I understand the quintessential Black Mask or Weird Tales or New Yorker story, but I do not understand the quintessential Post story. It is striking the degree to which the critical apparatus surrounding The Saturday Evening Post is much less than what exists for Weird Tales. I can buy a collection that purports to contain the best stories from Weird Tales, but there is nothing similar for the Post—at least nothing that's current in print. Similarly, there's been a lack of work online to contextualize the Post and define what kinds of stories it championed.Eventually I did track down one such collection, The Saturday Evening Post Treasury. This book came out in 1956, at the height of the Post's readership and influence. The volume is long out of print, but I purchased a used copy, and it is the source of much of what I know about the Post, because this volume's aim was to print a representative sample of the Post's fiction and nonfiction, and it included helpful blurb's in front of each story to describe its impact.The stories in this volume tend to fall into three categories. There are pulp-style adventure tales (for instance, about a man confronting a murderer on a back country road). There are stories that resemble high-brow short stories (Fitzgerald's \"Babylon, Revisited\", and stories by William Faulkner and Thomas Wolfe), and then there are a third category of middlebrow story that feels quite different from anything else I've read.As this book reveals, there was a variety of writer whose career was made by the post. These are writers like Kelland Clarence Buddington, Norman Reilly Raine, Arthur Train, and Mary Roberts Rinehart. Oftentimes these writers wrote series characters—recurring characters—that sometimes made fifty or a hundred appearances in the Post. I have a collection of stories sitting next to me about a character named Tugboat Annie—a canny female tugboat captain who uses her intimate knowledge of salvage law to beat out rival captains on the Pacific Coast. Norman Reilly Raine sold seventy-five of these stories to the Post between 1930 and 1960. Given that the Post paid between three and five thousand dollars per story to its top contributors ($5000 in 1930 would be more than $90,000 today), this means he made some insane, fantastic sum from writing these stories.And he was just one of many writers who wrote these stories and made this kind of money. Out of all the writers who wrote series-characters for the Post, a few are well-known, P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves and Wooster, G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown. Another, Booth Tarkington, still has something of a reputation for his novels, although his character Penrod—about whom he wrote dozens of stories for the Post—is largely unknown. But most of the writers who wrote this sort of fiction are completely forgotten. I am a little astonished by the degree to which I had never heard not just of these names, but of this entire genre of fiction—the middlebrow recurring-character story.These recurring characters definitely have a particular flavor to them. They're usually genial characters with a deceptively deep wisdom. For instance, there's Ephraim Tutt, a lawyer (originally from Maine) who practices in New York City and uses legal tricks to ensure the good party always win (even when he happens to be representing the bad guy). There's Scattergood Baines, a fat little man who arrives penniless in the town of Coldriver, and slowly comes to dominate both the business and political interests in his state. There's Tugboat Annie, who I already mentioned. There's Penrod, Booth Tarkington's character, who is a twelve-year-old scamp in the Tom Sawyer mold. There's the Siwash College stories, about undergrads at this little college who are always getting into scrapes. Many of these characters seem to have been quite popular. When they were reprinted in collections, the books often sold quite well (this is particularly true of Penrod). And oftentimes these characters gave rise to movies, television shows, and radio plays: Scattergood Baines, Tugboat Annie, and Siwash College all inspired movies. And that doesn't even get into the detective and thriller stories. J.P. Marquand's Mr. Moto stories were originally serialized in The Saturday Evening Post, so were many of Agatha Christie's Poirot novels. And I am sure there are other famous detectives who appeared there—people I am overlooking or forgetting.The Middle-Class StoryTaken as a whole, the journal seems to be quite distinctively middle-class. The paper was well-known for having a Republican, pro-business bias. It represented the old sort of Republican: the country-club Republican. It was the journal that you subscribed to if you were a certain sort of respectable middle-class family—my wife says that there were stacks of these magazines in the house of her grandfather, who'd been a professor of physics at Caltech.And in this journal there were serious, high-brow stories and there were articles about world affairs, but there were also lighter-hearted, more entertaining stories. And...that's what it was. Unlike with Weird Tales, the Post did not give rise to an enduring fandom. One can certainly imagine a scenario where people felt nostalgic for Scattergood Baines and Tugboat Annie, and they devoted some effort to preserving the memory of these characters. But that didn't happen. A number of authors who published in that journal (F. Scott Fitzgerald, Agatha Christie, and Ray Bradbury and others) retained or regained their popularity, and many other writers faded away. But nobody ever felt the need to create some narrative about this journal and its particular place in American letters.It does seem like this journal paid people a lot of money to write these series characters (Tugboat Annie and Scattergood Baines and the like), and that these characters...weren't necessarily that good. I've been trying to read this Tugboat Annie book for a few hours. Same thing with Scattergood Baines, I spent a few hours trying to read a book of stories about thise character. In each case, the first few stories were interesting, but over time I got the picture and lost interest. I personally don't feel a strong desire to sell you on Tugboat Annie or Scattergood Baines—so it's no surprise that nobody else has taken the trouble.If you want an example of this kind of Post story, you could do worse than reading the initial story in this volume about Baines. True, he had but a moment's glimpse of Coldriver before he decided he had moved there, but the glimpse showed him the location was the one he had been searching for.... Scattergood's specialty, his hobby, was valleys. Valleys down which splashed and roared sizable streams, whose mountain sides were covered with timber, and whose flats were comfortable farms—such valleys interested him with an especial interest. This first story is quite good, even if the rest become tedious. Baines is probably not the best example of a Post character, because although his author, Budington, sold over a hundred stories to the Post, he only sold a few Baines stories there—the rest appeared in American magazine.I also read a collection of stories about the kindly lawyer, Ephraim Tutt, and I found these very entertaining, especially his flights of rhetoric about the nature of the law:\"But why is it,\" persisted Miss Wiggin, \"that we invariably associate the idea of crime with that of 'poverty, hunger and dirt'?\"\"That is easy to explain,\" asserted Mr. Tutt. \"The criminal law originally dealt only with crimes of violence—such as murder, rape and assault. In the old days people didn't have any property in the modern sense—except their land, their cattle or their weapons. They had no bonds or stock or bank accounts...But\"—and here Mr. Tutt's voice rose indignantly—\"our greatest mistake is to assume that crimes of violence are the most dangerous to the state, for they are not. They cause greater disturbance and perhaps more momentary inconvenience, but they do not usually evince much moral turpitude. After all, it does no great harm if one man punches another in the head, or even in a fit of anger sticks a dagger in him. The police can easily handle all that. The real danger to the community lies in the crimes of duplicity—the cheats, frauds, false pretenses, tricks and devices, flimflams—practised most successfully by well-dressed gentlemanly crooks of polished manners.\"My takeaway from the PostI have had trouble writing this post, because I keep wanting to draw some kind of larger lesson about literature from this investigation. In fact, given the amount of time I've spent reading stories from the Post over the last few weeks, it's shocking how little I've managed to write here.For me, the biggest lesson has been that what I do, in this newsletter, really requires the work of other people. When I look into an author or a phenomenon, I am often hooked by messages that other people have spent a lot of time trying to put out. A great example is O. Henry. Many academics put in their time to studying O. Henry and trying to rehabilitate his reputation. That's exactly why this Library of America collection about him existed. And because of that collection, other critics wrote great articles about him. And I used all of that to inform myself and to write a post about him.With The Saturday Evening Post, that groundwork never got done. The story about the influence of this journal—it never got told in an easy-to-understand way. As a result, I'm only able to gesture somewhat at that influence, but even after this month of investigation I have only the vaguest idea of how people actually felt about The Saturday Evening Post and what its readers expected from its pages.My impression—and folks are free to dispute this with me—is that there is relatively little fondness out there for this journal. It is not a source of nostalgic memories. It's been revived periodically, but I don't know if anyone really cares that much about it. People might miss Norman Rockwell (who painted many Post covers) and Walter Cronkite, but they don't necessarily miss the Post.On the other hand, The Saturday Evening Post was revived recently, by a foundation run by a former editor of the journal. They've got a really nice website, and they seem quite purposeful in their work. As their missions statement notes: We have undertaken the important task of carefully preserving the history of the magazine. Through the use of specialized, high-resolution large-format digital scanners, and the hard work of dedicated staffers, we are working to convert every word and image of our print magazine to a digital format....We have just begun to scratch the surface of this rich history. It's a challenging but rewarding undertaking to document such an important record of not only the magazine, but also the weekly concerns and entertainments of our nation.So clearly there is some level of love and attention here, and perhaps this is the beginning of some turn-around in the fortunes of the journal. Maybe in twenty years, my own blog post will be viewed derisively, and folks won't even be able to imagine how I could've been confused about the tremendous, stupendous literary impact of the greatest journal of the 20th century, The Saturday Evening Post.Woman of Letters publishes critical essays (like this one) every Tuesday and short tales every Thursday.

      "content": "Raj Chetty is best known for extremely labor-intensive studies, with dozens of research assistants assembling and cleaning datasets to answer enormous questions. This approach can answer questions that nobody else can really answer, because no one else has the data! Who else has the tax records of millions of people, linked to their home address over decades? Archimedes said that with a long enough lever he could move the world; with a detailed enough administrative dataset, one can answer anything. Chetty's work is much deeper than mere regressions, though. Reading his work, what I was most impressed by was its depth. It is often clever, ingenious, and gives insights far beyond simply answering a specific question.A theme of his early work is trying to find sufficient statistics. Given a model of the economy with a few assumptions, what is the minimum of facts which we have to find in order to infer the welfare effects of some change? Sufficient statistics are a bridge between what are called structural models, and reduced form strategies. Reduced form strategies are likely the ones you have seen the most of, as it is a term encompassing all of the standard causal methods toolkit which economists use all the time. It is kind of going from the top down, being agnostic about mechanisms, and simply sees what happened when certain things changed. Structural models work from the bottom up, and try to measure deep, underlying parameters about people's nature and preferences. With those \"primitives\" in hand, you can plug them into a model and try out counterfactual policies.Subscribe nowThat all was a bit abstract, so to make it concrete, let's take Chetty's 2008 paper on unemployment insurance and unemployment. Increasing payouts for unemployment do indeed make unemployment spells last longer. However, there are two reasons for this to be so. On the one hand, you have the obvious channel where paying people to be unemployed leads them to be unemployed. On the other hand, let's imagine that matching with the right job takes time. If households are liquidity constrained, then shortening their unemployment spell is bad. In order to tell whether increasing unemployment insurance is good or bad, we need to tell which effect dominates the other, and by how much.The primary contribution of the paper is to show that you don't need to estimate why households have the liquidity constraints or moral hazard that they do. A structural model would go about estimating how constrained people's borrowing ability is, the curvature of their utility function, and other such \"primitives\", at the cost of the estimates being probably unsound. However, since any combination of primitives which results in the same moral hazard and liquidity has the same welfare implications, you don't need to concern yourself with what they are. And obviously, simply regressing differences in unemployment insurance across states on unemployment cannot answer the question, because a longer spell of unemployment could be either good or bad! It isn't perfect compared to a structural model – you can only answer some questions, and would be unable to convincingly solve for the effects of really big changes – but it's a lot better than knowing nothing at all.He finds that it is the liquidity effect which dominates. 60% of the increase in the length of unemployment is owing to removing liquidity constraints, while 40% is due to moral hazard. He shows this in a few ways. First, he compares the change in unemployment duration when benefits increase for constrained and unconstrained households (with constrained being proxied for with asset holdings and such). Second, he uses the receipt of severance upon the end of employment to generate variation in unemployment duration. Obviously, receiving severance is not random, but since it only has an effect on liquidity constrained households we might reasonably infer that removing liquidity constraints pushes us closer to the social optimum. In conclusion, the optimal unemployment benefits would be half of the period wage.Subscribe nowOne of the early sufficient statistics papers was Feldstein (1999), who was Chetty's advisor starting in undergrad. There, we want to identify the deadweight loss from income taxation. There are multiple ways in which we can change our behavior – changing our labor supply, changing how we consume, etc – but since optimization requires that they all have the same utility loss on the margin, we can fully capture the change in behavior from the change in taxable income. Chetty would update this by allowing for the possibility of simply evading taxes by misreporting. The taxable income elasticity is, alas, not a sufficient statistic for welfare in that case. Since some of the elasticity of the richest is simple evasion, higher tax rates aren't nearly as bad as they seem.He would also be persistently interested in how we should understand risk aversion. Take \"A New Method of Estimating Risk Aversion\", which is actually one of my favorite papers ever written. The simplest way to generate risk aversion is to say that people have declining marginal utility of income. Gaining a thousand dollars when you have a billion is a pittance, while gaining a thousand when you have nothing is life-changing. Thus, if we were given a choice between $500 and 50:50 shot at getting $1000, we would always take the former. The utility gain from the first $500 is larger than the second. We can describe the curvature with the coefficient of relative risk aversion, designated gamma.Chetty's insight is to recognize that under this definition, risk aversion, and the behavior of people when their pay increases, are one and the same. If your marginal utility declines as you earn more income, and the disutility from work is constant, then the extent to which you reduce your labor gives us an implied curvature of the utility function, and thus a coefficient of relative risk aversion. He needs to rule out the possibility that consumption and labor are complements, but he can do this fairly easily by looking at how much people reduce consumption when they lose their ability to work. The mean implied value of gamma is below one, and getting it above 2 would require a lower elasticity of labor supply than found in any of the 33 studies he considers as evidence.This contradicts the finding of risk-aversion drawn from financial markets. One of the common explanations for the \"equity premium puzzle\" (which is the wide gulf between the return to stocks and the return to bonds) is that people have very high levels of risk aversion. Given that these two methods of estimating risk aversion under the marginal utility framework give us wildly different answers, we are forced to conclude that risk-aversion comes from something other than just the curvature of the utility function.Subscribe nowRisk aversion would be the focus of most of the rest of his early work as well. If risk aversion is due to the curvature of the utility function, and it is strictly concave down, then we have no way to rationalize people both buying insurance and lottery tickets. Chetty and Szeidl (2007) provides sound microfoundations for why marginal utility might be bendy. Conventional analysis of risk assumes that people consume perfectly divisible goods. If this isn't the case, then people will opt into consumption bundles consisting of indivisible goods, such as a house or a car. Thus, people are quite sensitive to risk over substantial gambles, which would impinge upon their variable consumption, but quite open to risk when it, like a lottery, could transport them into a new level of consumption. This two-good model, one sticky and the other flexible, also well explains apparent habit formation better than standard habit models. In particular, it explains why consumption is affected by anticipated small shocks, but not large shocks; and argues that benefits levels should be lower than the optimum calculated with standard models.Chetty's first step into miraculous data access is his paper \"Salience and Taxation\", with Adam Looney and Kory Kroft. A fundamental assumption in tax theory is that the incidence of a tax is ultimately determined only by the elasticity of supply and demand, and not on who it is levied on. It shouldn't matter if a sales tax is paid at the register, or incorporated into the price tag.They, of course, find that it really does matter how the tax is administered. The first strategy is to compare states with taxes on beer which are levied at the counter or when the supplier buys them, and they of course find substantial differences. The other strategy, though, is getting a major retail chain to try out incorporating sales tax into the price displayed. I do not know how they convinced the supermarket to go along with it — as far as I can tell, they just asked nicely.I think his greatest paper is the duo of papers with Nathaniel Hendren on intergenerational mobility. (They were once one 143 page behemoth). It combines the ingenuity of methods of early Chetty with the perfect data of later Chetty to reach profound policy implications.We would like to know how much the place you grew up in affects your outcomes later in life. A starting point would simply be to regress the characteristics of the place you grew up on later in life outcomes. If poor or rich people sort to places with different characteristics, though, then your regression is biased. One can control for the characteristics of the people, but this won't work for two reasons. First, you are never going to plausibly control for all the characteristics which would affect later outcomes. Second, you are not able to observe many characteristics, nor tell which direction causality ran. Take intelligence, which predicts later income. You can't directly observe someone's latent ability, so you would proxy for this with their test scores – but whose to say if the test scores are associated with being in a given area due to people moving, or if the area caused higher test scores? You need exogenous variation in exposure to different areas.The method they use is simple but genius. Families move together, and children tend to stay with their family until they are grown. If a family moves together, then the younger children will be exposed to the new environment for longer. If everyone moves out at 18, then a family which makes a move with children at 12, 10, and 8 will get 6, 8, and 10 years of exposure to the new neighborhood. Comparing within the family allows you to pick up on everything which is static over time, not just what is easily observable. They also control for income and marital status, which varies over time.It would still be better to have an exogenous cause of moving. After all, perhaps a move reflects a changed attitude toward work, which also has a linear exposure effect. They use plant closures and natural disasters as a source of variation. Last of all, they wrap things up by seeing if the outcomes of children matches the variation of an area, conditional on exposure. Different places might have the same average incomes, but skewed differently. Alternatively, the effects of places could vary by gender. They find that outcomes do indeed vary in line with the places in the way that you would predict, which shouldn't happen unless families anticipate not only the average effect but also how it varies by gender.Subscribe nowIt is perhaps telling of my biases as an economist that I am almost disinterested in telling you the actual results, in preference to discussing the methods. People converge to the income of the new place at a rate of about 4% per year. The size of the effect is exclusively related to the time treated, and not directly related to the age at which a child moved except insofar as moving earlier allows you to be exposed for longer. This is fairly enormous for policy purposes, which has often fetishized early life interventions. Turns out, we should not expect anything magical about early life.Part one focused on the effect of place, but without trying to explain why. Part two investigates the effects of counties. The chief difficulty here is that instead of potential outcomes of children being unrelated to the decision to move on average, you now need the condition to hold for 3000 different counties. The innovation over the first paper in the series is measuring the effects of parents who move after their kids have grown. This would be generalized as the \"Opportunity Atlas\", which presents the impacts of all census tracts on later in life outcomes.Chetty, with Hendren and Larry Katz, covers much of the same ground in \"The Effects of Exposure to Better Neighborhoods on Children\", trading generalizability for identification. Moving to Opportunity was a government program in the mid-1990s which gave some families on Section 8 housing vouchers money which would only be spent to move to a better neighborhood. Moving has a fixed cost of disruption, and then positive effects related to the length of exposure. This would be replicated by another large-scale experiment in Seattle.Perhaps another way to improve life outcomes is better education. With data from (not mentioned in paper, but later confirmed in courtroom testimony) New York City, consisting of 2.5 million students and 18 million tests from 1989 to 2009, he can find the value added of teachers to students test scores, and thence the value added of a high quality teacher to lifetime income. This is not a trivial matter, of course. Students and their parents have some influence both over the school they go to, and which teachers they have. Here, controlling for observables is a more plausible approach, and we even have more information than before – they have parental income, which has approximately 0 predictive power. (They find that a $10,000 increase in income leads to a – let me make sure I have the zeroes right – 0.0001 standard deviation increase in teacher value added. That's the same as moving from a 50th percentile to a 50.0018 percentile teacher.)We can do better, though. Teachers move from school to school, or quit altogether. A teacher changing to another school with unusually high or low value added would show up as a change in the average value-added for a grade in a year. Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff's argument is that, while parents might be able to push for being assigned to some classrooms over others, they are very unlikely to abruptly shift schools based on whether one above or below average in a grade level was over the summer.The second paper ties test scores to later income. Methodologically this is uninteresting – if you have the value added and the income, your work is done. They argue that replacing a teacher in the bottom 5% of value added with an average teacher increases lifetime income by $250,000. Chetty would later testify to that effect in Vergara v. California, which ruled California's union rules around teacher hiring and firing unconstitutional.Their approach of finding teacher value-added is not without criticism. Jesse Rothstein (2017) would argue that teacher switching is not actually exogenous, and this leads to their results to be substantially smaller than otherwise believed, especially the connection to later life income. Prof. Rothstein argued for the defense in Vergara v. California; as Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff note in their reply, \"much of this paper is taken from response letters that we submitted to the American Economic Review during the review process of the CFR papers. In particular, two of Rothstein's concerns – on imputation and long-term controls – were raised and addressed during the referee process. Rothstein was one of the referees of the CFR papers – a fact that was disclosed during his testimony for the defense in Vergara v. California.\" (Footnote 2). CFR argue, in essence, that any bias in the results is very small, and does not substantially upset the results.Similarly to his work on intergenerational mobility, he (with Friedman, Hilger, Saez, Schanzenbach and Yagan) has a paper studying the same problem with an RCT. Project STAR was an experiment run by the state of Tennessee to test the impacts of small and large classrooms on student outcomes. Conditional upon being within a school, the classroom which you got was randomly assigned, and thus uncorrelated with everything else. Having a small classroom, even for a few years, had positive effects in school, in likelihood of going to college, and thence incomes.Subscribe nowIn the interest of space, I will not discuss all of his papers in detail, much though I wish to. I have tried to keep to those papers which are the most thought-provoking, not necessarily those which are most policy important. I will cover them here in rapid-fire format.He has two enormous papers on the causes of innovation. The first, \"Who Becomes an Inventor in America?\", disambiguates the latent ability to invent from having the environment to do so. High-income individuals are much more likely to patent than below average individuals, even after controlling for math scores. In particular, having someone in your family or in your neighborhood patent greatly increases the chance that you do so in the same narrowly defined patent class. Since the determinants of innovation are largely due to career choice driven by prior exposure, tax cuts have only a limited ability to increase innovation, as they show in a follow-up paper.Racial disparities in income, conditional upon the income of the parent, are entirely explained by differences between black and white males, with no difference for women. There is also considerably more intergenerational mobility among hispanics and whites than for black and Native Americans. Part of the black-white gap is on account of lower marriage rates, so considering individual rather than household outcomes will reduce the gap. The high upward mobility of Asians is entirely driven by first generation immigrants, after which they have similar outcomes.Card, Chetty, and Weber (2007) is similar in conception to his paper on unemployment insurance, and exploits a quirk in eligibility for severance in the Austrian labor market to estimate how people change their search behavior when they have cash on hand. This again finds that people are meaningfully credit-constrained, and the permanent income hypothesis does not hold perfectly.I have not covered all of the excellent papers which he has been involved with, as I want to cover them in later blog posts. I think he could be deservedly awarded the Nobel this year; part of me believes that they should not worry about fitting in the old folks, and just award it now. This has been the third part of an ongoing series on the great economists of our time; previously, I covered Duflo, Banerjee, and Kremer, and Paul Krugman.

Colophon: All the rest. AI software assistants make the hardest kinds of bugs to spot (permalink) It's easy to understand why some programmers love their AI assistants and others loathe them: the former group get to decide how and when they use AI tools, while the latter has AI forced upon them by bosses who hope to fire their colleagues and increase their workload. Formally, the first group are \"centaurs\" (people assisted by machines) and the latter are \"reverse-centaurs\" (people conscripted into assisting machines): https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/27/rancid-vibe-coding/#class-war Most workers have parts of their jobs they would happily automate away. I know of a programmer who uses AI to take a first pass at CSS code for formatted output. This is a notoriously tedious chore, and it's not hard to determine whether the AI got it right – just eyeball the output in a variety of browsers. If this was a chore you hated doing and someone gave you an effective tool to automate it, that would be cause for celebration. What's more, if you learned that this was only reliable for a subset of cases, you could confine your use of the AI to those cases. Likewise, many workers dream of doing something through automation that is so expensive or labor-intensive that they can't possibly do it. I'm thinking here of the film editor who extolled the virtues to me of deepfaking the eyelines of every extra in a crowd scene, which lets them change the focus of the whole scene without reassembling a couple hundred extras, rebuilding the set, etc. This is a brand new capability that increases the creative flexibility of that worker, and no wonder they love it. It's good to be a centaur! Then there's the poor reverse-centaurs. These are workers whose bosses have saddled them with a literally impossible workload and handed them an AI tool. Maybe they've been ordered to use the tool, or maybe they've been ordered to complete the job (or else) by a boss who was suggestively waggling their eyebrows at the AI tool while giving the order. Think of the freelance writer whom Hearst tasked with singlehandedly producing an entire, 64-page \"best-of\" summer supplement, including multiple best-of lists, who was globally humiliated when his \"best books of the summer\" list was chock full of imaginary books that the AI \"hallucinated\": https://www.404media.co/viral-ai-generated-summer-guide-printed-by-chicago-sun-times-was-made-by-magazine-giant-hearst/ No one seriously believes that this guy could have written and fact-checked all that material by himself. Nominally, he was tasked with serving as the \"human in the loop\" who validated the AI's output. In reality, he was the AI's fall-guy, what Dan Davies calls an \"accountability sink,\" who absorbed the blame for the inevitable errors that arise when an employer demands that a single human sign off on the products of an error-prone automated system that operates at machine speeds. It's never fun to be a reverse centaur, but it's especially taxing to be a reverse centaur for an AI. AIs, after all, are statistical guessing programs that infer the most plausible next word based on the words that came before. Sometimes this goes badly and obviously awry, like when the AI tells you to put glue or gravel on your pizza. But more often, AI's errors are precisely, expensively calculated to blend in perfectly with the scenery. AIs are conservative. They can only output a version of the future that is predicted by the past, proceeding on a smooth, unbroken line from the way things were to the way they are presumed to be. But reality isn't smooth, it's lumpy and discontinuous. Take the names of common code libraries: these follow naming conventions that make it easy to predict what a library for a given function will be, and to guess what a given library does based on its name. But humans are messy and reality is lumpy, so these conventions are imperfectly followed. All the text-parsing libraries for a programming language may look like this: docx.text.parsing; txt.text.parsing, md.text.parsing, except for one, which defies convention by being named text.odt.parsing. Maybe someone had a brainfart and misnamed the library. Maybe the library was developed independently of everyone else's libraries and later merged. Maybe Mercury is in retrograde. Whatever the reason, the world contains many of these imperfections. Ask an LLM to write you some software and it will \"hallucinate\" (that is, extrapolate) libraries that don't exist, because it will assume that all text-parsing libraries follow the convention. It will assume that the library for parsing odt files is called \"odt.text.parsing,\" and it will put a link to that nonexistent library in your code. This creates a vulnerability for AI-assisted code, called \"slopsquatting,\" whereby an attacker predicts the names of libraries AIs are apt to hallucinate and creates libraries with those names, libraries that do what you would expect they'd do, but also inject malicious code into every program that incorporates them: https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/12/ai_code_suggestions_sabotage_supply_chain/ This is the hardest type of error to spot, because the AI is guessing the statistically most plausible name for the imaginary library. It's like the AI is constructing one of those spot-the-difference image puzzles on super-hard mode, swapping the fork and knife in a diner's hands from left to right and vice-versa. You couldn't generate a harder-to-spot bug if you tried. It's not like people are very good at supervising machines to begin with. \"Automation blindness\" is what happens when you're asked to repeatedly examine the output of a generally correct machine for a long time, and somehow remain vigilant for its errors. Humans aren't really capable of remaining vigilant for things that don't ever happen – whatever attention and neuronal capacity you initially devote to this never-come eventuality is hijacked by the things that happen all the time. This is why the TSA is so fucking amazing at spotting water-bottles on X-rays, but consistently fails to spot the bombs and guns that red team testers smuggle into checkpoints. The median TSA screener spots a hundred water bottles a day, and is (statistically) never called upon to spot something genuinely dangerous to a flight. They have put in their 10,000 hours, and then some, on spotting water bottles, and approximately zero hours on spotting stuff that we really, really don't want to see on planes. So automation blindness is already going to be a problem for any \"human in the loop,\" from a radiologist asked to sign off on an AI's interpretation of your chest X-ray to a low-paid overseas worker remote-monitoring your Waymo...to a programmer doing endless, high-speed code-review for a chatbot. But that coder has it worse than all the other in-looped humans. That coder doesn't just have to fight automation blindness – they have to fight automation blindness and spot the subtlest of errors in this statistically indistinguishable-from-correct code. AI's are basically doing bug steganography, smuggling code defects in by carefully blending them in with correct code. At code shops around the world, the reverse centaurs are suffering. A survey of Stack Overflow users found that AI coding tools are creating history's most difficult-to-discharge technology debt in the form of \"almost right\" code full of these fiendishly subtle bugs: https://venturebeat.com/ai/stack-overflow-data-reveals-the-hidden-productivity-tax-of-almost-right-ai-code/ As Venturebeat reports, while usage of AI coding assistants is up (from 76% last year to 84% this year), trust in these tools is plummeting – 33%, with no bottom in sight. 45% of coders say that debugging AI code takes longer than writing the code without AI at all. Only 29% of coders believe that AI tools can solve complex code problems. Venturebeat concludes that there are code shops that \"solve the 'almost right' problem\" and see real dividends from AI tools. What they don't say is that the coders for whom \"almost right\" isn't a problem are centaurs, not reverse centaurs. They are in charge of their own production and tooling, and no one is using AI tools as a pretext for a relentless hurry-up amidst swingeing cuts to headcount. The AI bubble is driven by the promise of firing workers and replacing them with automation. Investors and AI companies are tacitly (and sometimes explicitly) betting that bosses who can fire a worker and replace them with a chatbot will pay the chatbot's maker an appreciable slice of that former worker's salary for an AI that takes them off the payroll. The people who find AI fun or useful or surprising are centaurs. They're making automation choices based on their own assessment of their needs and the AIs' capabilities. They are not the customers for AI. AI exists to replace workers, not empower them. Even if AI can make you more productive, there is no business model in increasing your pay and decreasing your hours. AI is about disciplining labor to decrease its share of an AI-using company's profits. AI exists to lower a company's wage-bill, at your expense, with the savings split between your boss and an AI company. When Getty or the NYT or another media company sues an AI company for copyright infringement, that doesn't mean they are opposed to using AI to replace creative workers – they just want a larger slice of the creative workers' salaries in the form of a copyright license from the AI company that sells them the worker-displacing tool. They'll even tell you so. When the movie studios sued Midjourney, the RIAA (whose most powerful members are subsidiaries of the same companies that own the studios) sent out this press statement, attributed to RIAA CEO Mitch Glazier: There is a clear path forward through partnerships that both further AI innovation and foster human artistry. Unfortunately, some bad actors – like Midjourney – see only a zero-sum, winner-take-all game. Get that? The problem isn't that Midjourney wants to replace all the animation artists – it's that they didn't pay the movie studios license fees for the training data. They didn't create \"partnerships.\" Incidentally: Mitch Glazier's last job was as a Congressional staffer who slipped an amendment into a must-pass bill that killed musicians' ability to claim the rights to their work back after 35 years through \"termination of transfer.\" This was so outrageous that Congress held a special session to reverse it and Glazier lost his job. Whereupon the RIAA hired him to run the show. AI companies are not pitching a future of AI-enabled centaurs. They're colluding with bosses to build a world of AI-shackled reverse centaurs. Some people are using AI tools (often standalone tools derived from open models, running on their own computers) to do some fun and exciting centaur stuff. But for the AI companies, these centaurs are a bug, not a feature – and they're the kind of bug that's far easier to spot and crush than the bugs that AI code-bots churn out in volumes no human can catalog, let alone understand.

      "content": "A couple of weeks ago, I was listening to Ross Douthat interview Allie Beth Stuckey, a conservative Christian writer and podcaster. Then I heard my name. From the transcript: Douthat: You wrote a book entitled \"Toxic Empathy: How Progressives Exploit Christian Compassion.\" You can see just from the subtitle that it is effectively both a critique of secular progressivism and also a critique of your fellow Christians.I think a lot of people hear a word like \"empathy\" and think that it is just something that Christians are automatically called to and that a critique of empathy is effectively a critique of Christianity itself.What is toxic empathy? What is wrong with some forms of empathy, from your perspective?Stuckey: That is correct: some forms of empathy. I argue — and this is not my original argument — I heard Abigail Shrier first say this, and I think she might have even got this from Paul Bloom, a Yale psychologist who wrote a book called \"Against Empathy.\"Douthat: An interesting side note is that in fact my own mother once wrote an essay critiquing empathy for First Things magazine some years ago. In it, she drew on Paul Bloom, who is a secular psychologist, criticizing from a secular perspective, an overidentification with other people's feelings.All of which is to say I am a somewhat sympathetic audience for this kind of argument.Stuckey: I just wanted to give proper credit for this first line that I'm about to say: Empathy by itself is neutral. Empathy by itself, I believe, is neither good nor bad. That's probably not an exact quote from Paul Bloom, but that's where I got that line of reasoning.The next day, I was contacted by Jennifer Szalai, who interviewed me for an article on the recent attack on empathy by Stuckey and others.Szalai discussed new books by Stuckey and by Joe Rigney. In their books, Stuckey and Rigney start out insisting that they're not trying to stamp out empathy per se — they oppose only \"toxic\" (Stuckey) or \"untethered\" (Rigney) versions, which trick Christians into tolerating abortion access and gay marriage. Giving the example of a 12-year-old raped by her stepfather, Rigney says that granting her request for an abortion is an example of the \"empathetic myopia\" that fuels \"the culture of Death.\" Stuckey says that as much as she feels sorry for the undocumented Mexican mother detained by ICE after 14 years in the United States, \"Scripture depicts walls, both literally and metaphorically, as a defense against disorder and evil.\"It's not just conservative Christians who are critical of empathy these days, Szalai notes. It's also billionaire edgelords. In February, when Elon Musk went on Joe Rogan's podcast, Musk derided Democrats for succumbing to \"suicidal empathy.\" Caring about others, the men agreed, had gotten so out of control that it was becoming self-destructive. \"The fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy,\" Musk said. \"They're exploiting a bug in Western civilization, which is the empathy response.\"I'm not sure how much I've influenced these ideas. I hope I haven't. My moral views are very different from those of Stuckey, Rigney, and Musk, and I think that many of the policies that these individuals defend are awful. Listening to Stuckey talk about Against Empathy is like listening to an interview with Jeffrey Dahmer and hearing him say that he was inspired by a cookbook I wrote. But I do think Stuckey gets a lot of things right. She presents this example to Douthat. If you take the abortion issue, I start out by telling the story of a woman named Samantha.Her story was first told by NPR. She found out that her baby had a fatal fetal anomaly at the 20-week mark, but in Texas she wasn't allowed to abort her child. NPR tells the story as if this was horrible for Samantha, who had to go through the financial, physical, emotional burden of bearing this child, only to have this child to die.By the end of the story, the reader feels exactly how it seems NPR wants them to feel, which is that this is a great injustice toward Samantha. How dare these draconian laws force her to do something so painful, so financially burdensome. We need to liberate women from these anti-abortion laws that are making them go through so much.You have so much empathy for Samantha that you support the pro-abortion position by the end of this, through the mode of storytelling. Stuckey goes on to complain that this is a cheap argument against the Texas law. I agree with her. Certainly, Samantha's suffering should carry weight. In the absence of any other consideration, her terrible experience is a powerful argument against the law. But every large-scale policy is likely to cause serious harm to some people, and so focusing on a single case is more of a rhetorical move than a reasoned argument. This might be hard to see in this example if, like me, your heart is already set against this anti-abortion law. So let's change the sort of empathic argument we're looking at. The following is from an article I wrote over ten years ago, before a certain real estate mogul rose to public office. Politicians are comfortable exploiting this dark side of empathy. Donald Trump likes to talk about Kate—he doesn't use her full name, Kate Steinle, just Kate. She was killed in San Francisco by an undocumented immigrant, and Trump wants to make her real to his audience, to make vivid his talk of Mexican killers. Similarly, Ann Coulter's recent book, Adios, America, is rich with detailed descriptions of immigrant crimes, particularly rape and child rape, with chapter titles like \"Why Do Hispanic Valedictorians Make the News, But Child Rapists Don't?\" and headings like \"Lost a friend to drugs? Thank a Mexican.\" Trump and Coulter use these stories to stoke our feelings for innocent victims, to motivate support for policies against the immigrants who are said to prey upon these innocents.If you want, you can read what happened to Kate Steinle here, or read here about the tragic death of Laken Riley, raped and murdered by an illegal immigrant. You can also look at their faces—this often helps intensify one's empathic response. Kate SteinleLaken RileyThere is something wrong with anyone who is unmoved by the death of these women, and I assume that few of the readers of Small Potatoes are moral monsters. So does this seal the deal? Have you now been convinced that Donald Trump is right in his aggressive policies towards illegal immigrants? I hope your response here is that this is a bullshit argument. You don't make policy decisions based on heart-wrenching tales.1 But if it's a bullshit argument to trot out our Steinle and Riley in support of an anti-immigration law, it's just as much a bullshit argument to trot out Samantha to attack an anti-abortion law. In her conversation with Douthat, Stuckey puts it nicely. Ultimately, and this is really my argument in the book, there are always going to be people on both sides of any story with real pain, with real stories that matter. But this is where my agreement with Stuckey ends. One concern I have is that her critique of empathy is inconsistent. She is a fierce critic of empathic arguments by progressives, but she's happy to trot them out for her own side. Right after she explains that we shouldn't fall for the story of Samantha, who went through terrible suffering because of this Texas law, she tells us this: They [liberals] don't want you to think about the actual victim of abortion. What would have been the fate of this baby, whose name is Halo? What would have been her fate if Texas had not had this — quote, unquote — pro-life law? She would've been poisoned. She would've been dismembered. She would've been discarded like toxic waste.But instead, she was delivered and clothed and named and held and loved and buried like the full human being that she is.Now, maybe I'm being unfair. Maybe Stuckey was making a point to Douthat: Look, I'm going to make the opposite empathic argument here, this time on the side of the baby; I hope the obviously manipulative nature of my Halo story will help your liberal readers see how illegitimate such appeals are. Maybe, but I don't think so. Later in the interview, she trots out exactly the same sorts of stories that Trump used to attack illegal immigrants. Stuckey: .... they'll never talk about Kate Steinle or Laken Riley or the stories on the other side of it.Douthat: And the stories on the other side are stories of Americans who have been murdered or assaulted by illegal immigrants.Stuckey: Yes. I forget the New York Times audience might not just know those stories automatically and those names.The frustration she expresses here—why aren't liberals more familiar with these well-known stories of immigrant crimes?—makes me wonder about her consistency as a critic of empathy. One last point about consistency. Stuckey thinks moral decisions should not be made by appeal to abstract rights or by weighing costs and benefits. Moral decisions should be made by reading the Bible. But, as she concedes, the Bible doesn't give clear guidelines about immigration. This made me curious as to how she would answer this question. Douthat: Is there something that Donald Trump could do on immigration policy that you would consider evil?Stuckey knows a lot more about the Bible than I do, and I wondered which Biblical principles would clash with extreme anti-immigrant policies. Perhaps she would express concerns about the separation of families, or talk about a moral imperative to care for refugees from repressive regimes. But, no, she said this. Stuckey: I am most sympathetic when it comes to the taking in of Christian refugees from the Middle East and elsewhere. I want these people to be protected. My highest priority is the protection and the preservation of Christians, especially persecuted Christians. The stories that I've seen about Christian refugees from war-torn areas having a difficult time coming to the United States are the most difficult for me.This isn't principled moral reasoning, and it's not religiously grounded. It's just tribalism. I want Trump to make an exception for people like me.I'll end with a word about Musk. Earlier this year, the White House posted a video of immigrants in shackles being prepared to be deported. The heading they gave to the post said \"ASMR: Illegal Alien Deportation Flight\", where ASMR, or \"Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response,\" refers to a pleasant feeling some people experience when hearing certain sounds. Elon Musk found this funny. As I said, I don't think one should decide complex issues by zooming in on the suffering of specific individuals. One can support an immigration policy while knowing that it will cause real harm to some people, because any policy will have such an effect. But of course, concern for the suffering of people is foundational to morality; such suffering is something we should always try to minimize. It's hard to see in Musk's reaction a real concern that empathy will lead people astray, leading to greater overall harm. It looks more like a general indifference to (or worse, amusement from) the pain of certain others. When Musk complains about 'suicidal empathy', I don't think he's worrying about the failure to apply consistent moral principles. It's just a fancy way to say that some people aren't worth caring about. Szalai was kind enough to give me the last word in her article.... Instead of critiquing empathy as a tool for moral reasoning, anti-empathy warriors seem intent on obliterating any shared sense of common humanity.I called Bloom to ask what he made of this development. He distinguished \"Against Empathy\" from \"near neighbors to my view which are just calls for cruelty and bias.\"\"My book is a call for compassion, kindness and the ways in which empathy can get away from that,\" Bloom said. He added, \"I worry that some people think, for whatever reason, 'I don't want to care about immigrants,' or 'I don't want to care about Africans.' And so what they say is, 'Well, I hear empathy is bad. So I guess that justifies me not caring.' But that's a terrible point to make.\"Yes, stories about suffering can lead people astray. But such suffering matters; one shouldn't delight in it. Small Potatoes is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.1Against Empathy goes on to enumerate many other problems with empathy. It is too unreliable and arbitrary to form the basis for policy judgments; it's innumerate, parochial, and biased. The stories of Steinle and Riley illustrate this—they are especially moving to many Americans because they are attractive young white women, but, upon reflection, most people would agree that this fact shouldn't carry special moral weight.",

      "content": "\"Do you have anything you would recommend on...?\" It is a question I get asked regularly by readers and those interested in learning more about agrarianism. So, what I thought I would do — as a form pf public service to all agrarians — is create a curated guide of the top books for each of the fields of study that I write on (agrarianism, creation care, nature and ecology, techno-scepticism). This extensive post is the fruit of this idea. I hope this resource that I have created helps to form a new generation of deep agrarian thinkers and practitioners — and do send me your recommendations and favourites on these topics too. I'd love to hear them. Wendell BerryThere were so many more books I could have recommended for Wendell Berry's essays, but these are the four that I have found most useful. The World Ending Fire, edited by Paul Kingsnorth is the selection of Berry's best works (and is the book I am using in my reading groups); The Gift of Good Land is a large collection of agricultural essays and some of Berry's most practical agricultural pieces; It All Turns on Affection contains Berry's seminal essay going by the same name, which I rank as one of his most important essays. It also is an insight into what drives the man behind the words; Another Turn of the Crank is a small work with some of the most fundamental essays for an agrarian to master concerning how to live ecologically in the modern world — a world which is so antithetical to agrarian values. AgrarianismThese two works delve deeply into what it means to be an agrarian, both practically and spiritually. The Essential Agrarian Reader is a collection of essays concerning all aspects of agrarianism from basic philosophy, land tenure, legal aspects, globalisation, the Agrarian Mind, and much more. There really is no better book to understand what it means to be an agrarian than this one. Agrarian Spirit on the other hand, considers what it means to be an agrarian in terms of virtues and the cultivation of one's own personhood. Both practice and piety are essential to become a fully formed well rounded agrarian. These two books help us along this journey. Creation CareWriting concerning creation care and Christian environmental stewardship is going to become a much bigger theme of my writing here on Over the Field and these are the four best books that I recommend. Hope for God's Creation is an excellent introduction to the main topics and debates; Creation Care then delves a little bit deeper on similar themes. As Long As the Earth Endures is a collection of academic essays that critically consider vital themes such as eschatology, the curse, doctrine of creation, and more. Finally, Schaeffer's Pollution and the Death of Man is the cream of the crop, a masterful and prophetic treatment of environmental action from an evangelical perspective. Schaeffer was well ahead of his time, and he is still relevant today. His concept of 'substantial healing' is the single most important creation care concept guiding our practical action today in my opinion. Environmental and Rural philosophy Scruton's Green Philosophy has been a life changing book to read slowly. It presents a convincing case for the importance of environmental care/action from a profoundly conservative perspective. Scruton argues again and again that conservatives and conservationists should be natural friends — I could not agree more. One other thing that I highly valued was Scruton's emphasis on personal responsibility and action over and against state proxification; we need a great deal more volunteerism and personal action if we are to resolve some of the deeply entrenched ecological issues plaguing our modern societies. Kingsnorth's Confessions of a Recovering Environmentalist contains two of the best essays I have ever read: Learning What to Make of It, and Dark Ecology. Real England is one of those books I wish all politicians would read, as it highlights all the precious things that we are losing to the Machine — and all that makes England special. The Abbey of MisruleDo not be conformed to this worldBy Paul KingsnorthTechnology and techno-scepticism Habits of the High Tech Heart is something which deserves to be better known than it is. It is a very helpful book about how to cultivate virtuous ways of interacting (or not) with technology. Written before AI and even before the smartphone took off, Schultze is remarkably prophetic. Then need I say more about Ellul's The Technological Society? It is a classic for a reason. British Farming writingRebanks' English Pastoral is utterly superb. Incredibly beautiful wordsmanship, devastating accounts of what we have lost (and how), and a hopeful plea for the future. A book to read again and again. Field Work by Bella Bathurst is a brutally realistic book on the bitter laments (and joys) of farming in the 21st Century.Writing in Defence of the Small FarmChris Smaje is one of those thinkers who has shaped my thinking in an extraordinary way and A Small Farm Future is essential reading for any agrarian. Chris charts what the future likely looks like for small farms and analyses critically a number of vital concerns such as family dynamics, energy security, land tenure, and agronomy. He also considers the question 'can small farming feed us?' which is a question we all must wrestle with. Saying No To A Small Farm Future is a follow up work which responds to some of the solar bio-fermentation/farm free future debates. Particularly, it is a rebuttal to George Monbiot's Regenesis. Chris's SubstackMy personal SubstackBy Chris SmajeBritish CountrysideRackham's The History of the Countryside is THE book for understanding the changes that have occurred in Britain's landscapes and how to read the landscape when out on a walk today. Tir is a book that does a similar job for the Welsh landscape but has an additional core focus of showing how it is the work of nature AND humans in harmony that creates the beauty and biological diversity of the landscape. And for some of the finest nature writing going, John Lewis-Stempel is the one to read and England is his masterpiece.

      "content": "This essay originally appeared in The Tearoom by .I've never liked doctors. As a writer, I am both overly sensitive to my own mortality and something of a hypochondriac; I find most American physicians either unpleasant or downright terrifying, and I'll avoid doctors at all costs until a visit becomes absolutely necessary. But one doctor has always had my heart: Tertius Lydgate—literature's first modern doctor.Until the 1874 publication of George Eliot's Middlemarch, few works of literature had ever taken on the topic of medicine. Before the Victorian era, in fact, the practice of medicine was not only nebulous but also unscrupulous: given the industry's lack of regulation, doctors frequently prescribed dangerous substances such as opium or laudanum or resorted to unsanitary practices such as bloodletting to prolong patient life and minimize suffering. By the mid-19th century, however, innovations in medicine ushered in a new wave of medical standardization and an overall increase in quality of patient care.George Eliot was awestruck, and Middlemarch was born.One might wonder at the ease with which Eliot captures the nuances of medicine in literary form, but the Victorian literary prodigy was no stranger to innovation—her unorthodox relationship with British philosopher George Henry Lewes catalyzed her love for experimentation and exposed her to the thriving world of medical discovery in both Britain and in mainland Europe. Though Eliot lived with the married Lewes out of wedlock (a practice that often made pariahs out of respectable people), his Regent's Park home quickly became her haven for intellectual exploration.Eliot obtained firsthand knowledge of the scientific discoveries of the Victorian era through her position as the chief editor of the Westminster Review. Her own interest in science, as well as her commitment to Auguste Comte's positivism, an empiricist philosophical theory that directly influenced the scientific method, led her to spend her evenings reading Darwin's On the Origin of Species aloud to Lewes every evening, inspiring the seasoned philosopher to branch out into the scientific world. Lewes' first great scientific venture—an essay titled Physicians and Quacks—examined the relationship between psychological and physiological phenomena and argued in favor of \"scientist doctors,\" an emerging profession that envisioned doctors as researchers and laid the foundation for the medical practice as we think of it today. Physicians and Quacks soon won the admiration of Charles Lyell and Thomas Henry Huxley, influential scientists who worked closely together on the study of fossils and human history in the mid-1800s, and established Lewes as a respected scientist of the Victorian world.By 1870, Lewes, now a full-fledged scientist, became particularly fascinated by the brain and took a trip out to Oxford University with his lover to conduct neuroscience research. It was there that a professor of anatomy dissected a human brain for the young Eliot and sparked her interest in human psychology. Around the same time, Lewes spent several weeks in Bonn and Heidelberg discussing Marie Francois Bichat's cell theory—the proposition that cellular tides were the basis of every organism—with anatomists Max Schultze and Nikolaus Friedrich. Taking a particular interest in the nerve cell, Lewes soon came out with a book called Problems of the Life and Mind.This was the book that inspired Middlemarch.After returning home, Eliot's first and most important agenda item was the composition of what was to become the fifteenth chapter of her work—an introduction to Tertius Lydgate, literature's first modern doctor. Bichat himself inspired the character of Lydgate, a young professional captivated by recent discoveries in French autopsy. Lydgate's belief, in fact, that pathological methods are the key to promoting social good is the cornerstone of Bichat's own work in cell theory, and like Bichat, Lydgate hopes to find the \"primitive tissue underlying all structures.\" He engages in basic tissue research to complement his medical practice and becomes the first doctor in literature to both treat patients and conduct research of his own—a detail that Eliot includes to emphasize the standardization of the medicine by the mid-19th century.Indeed, before the 19th century, the medical profession was largely unregulated: virtually anyone could become a doctor, and, given the lack of formal legislature, the profession was dominated by the aristocratic elite and often corrupted by nepotism and other spurious practices. Under this system, doctors were often divided into three distinct roles: physician, surgeon, and apothecary. Physicians, typically university-educated and often serving the wealthy, were considered the intellectual elite of medicine. In contrast, surgeons—originally trained as apprentices and often regarded as manual laborers—occupied a lower social and professional status. Apothecaries, who dispensed medicines and provided some medical care, further added to the fragmented state of the medical field.Reform efforts of the early 19th century, however, began to introduce stricter standards. In 1815, the Apothecaries Act in the United Kingdom mandated that aspiring medical practitioners pass exams administered by the Society of Apothecaries, marking one of the first attempts to formalize medical qualifications. Over the next decade, movements advocating for the regulation of the profession and the incorporation of the scientific method into medical practice gained momentum, with \"Doctor's Registration Movements\" pushing for more standardized practices in diagnosis and treatment. However, it was not until the Medical Act of 1858, which established a register of qualified medical practitioners, that the truly \"modern\" doctor was born: doctors were now required to demonstrate their medical proficiency through standardized education and examinations, marking the formal professionalization of the field. By the mid-19th century, the unification of the medical profession had been achieved, with doctors and surgeons both subject to standardized education and examinations—a policy shift that marked the birth of the truly \"modern\" doctor. As Lewes' \"scientist doctor\"—doctors who were also researchers—swept the nation, the modern physician emerged, blending intellectual rigor, practical skill, and scientific inquiry.Eliot's Lydgate is the epitome of such a modern doctor: he is an amalgam of surgeon, physician, and apothecary, treating both external conditions such as typhoid fever in Fred Vincy and internal conditions such as heart failure in Edward Casaubon. Trained as a surgeon in London and later Paris, Lydgate is Eliot's representation of the dissolution of the elite College of Physicians as more surgeons began to cross over into the practice of physicians. In Middlemarch, Lydgate expresses the unapologetically progressive belief that diagnoses must come from scientific evidence; his willingness to listen to patients' complaints, as well as his adherence to the Apothecaries Act of 1815, which prohibited the dispensation of drugs by doctors for financial profit, demonstrate not only his own status as a modern practitioner but also Eliot's keen understanding of the scientific world around her.Indeed, Eliot sends her young doctor to Paris for his education—a site of momentous research in the medical field at the time of Middlemarch's composition. It is here that Lydgate acquires the majority of the medical knowledge he puts into practice throughout the novel, gaining familiarity with famous French physicians and scientists at the time. An intimate understanding of physician Pierre Louis' studies on typhoid fever, for instance, allows Lydgate to identify Fred Vincy's condition in its early \"pink stage\"; similarly, Lydgate uses René Laënnec's newfangled stethoscope to diagnose Causaubon's heart disease. Beyond his private practice, Lydgate also tackles public health challenges, observing the connection between London's contaminated water supply and cholera outbreaks and calling out institutional corruption.Determined to bring scientific medicine to the town of Middlemarch, Lydgate works for the New Fever Hospital in the hopes of establishing a special ward for cholera victims. He aligns himself with the Parliamentary Act of 1825, which authorized sanitation assessments, and envisions his hospital as a \"nucleus\" for a future medical school—a precursor to modern academic hospitals under Britain's current National Health Service (NHS).Eliot, however, does not fail to call out the inadequacies of mid-19th century healthcare and the regressive attitudes that permeate Victorian society: However radical Lydgate may be, conservative forces ultimately thwart his vision for Middlemarch. His pioneering tissue research becomes overshadowed by practical concerns as he struggles with bureaucracy, social resistance to reform, and personal financial difficulties, illustrating the widening divide between scientist and doctor in Eliot's world.Setting out to become a researcher, Lydgate ultimately finds himself trapped by the realities of medical practice. Through his pioneering story, Eliot captures the tension between scientific idealism and medical pragmatism but does not leave us on a negative note. Though Lydgate fails in his tissue research and hospital reforms, his Parisian education, diagnostic skill, and commitment to evidence-based medicine align him with the modern doctor—a figure who, by the end of the 19th century, would become the standard in medical practice.Middlemarch is thus not only one of the most important works of 19th century literature but also a seminal document on the history of medicine. And at a time when medicine was subject to radical change, Eliot presents us with Tertius Lydgate as the bridge between past and future—between medicine as a science and as an art form, reminding us just how intimately bound up medicine can be with humanity itself.Enjoyed this post?

      "content": "AI generated for more cheap irony purposesThe ChatGPT/LLM era is now old enough that the discourse cycle has gone round quite a few times, which means we now find ourselves in the metadiscursive phase, when half of the discourse is about the discourse. Since we're mostly all sitting around waiting for the AI rapture to arrive, it's little surprise that things have gotten a bit... decadent.Consider this post by Scott Alexander of Astral Codex Ten. His piece isn't about AI but rather recent developments in using IVF to select for embryos with desirable traits, which is now a field with several prominent for-profit competitors, a good deal of investment, and a growing customer base. This isn't actual embryo editing but rather embryo screening, which that can have a larger effect than you'd think. (This kind of thing might prove to be a big deal.) The piece is Alexander at his best, a demonstration of why he's been so successful as a writer: it's deeply knowledgeable, patient, thorough, willing to wade into some fairly deep technical waters, curious, and skeptical where warranted. He sees the potential for the technology but is aware of the challenges. He considers various ethical and political dimensions in a way that's engaged without getting dragged down into the morass of those controversies. I came away from the piece better informed and entertained.And then, near the end, he says \"The average age at diagnosis for Type II diabetes is 45 years. Will there still be people growing gradually older and getting Type II diabetes and taking insulin injections in 2070? If not, what are we even doing here?\" That's right folks: AI is coming so there's no point in developing new medical technology. In less than a half-century, we may very well no longer be growing old. Pack it up! Any resemblance between this promise to end aging and many millennia of witch doctors and conmen claiming to do the same thing is purely coincidental.What I want to underline here is not the overconfidence in our near \"AI\" future, not yet. For now I just want to call your attention to the incredible disparity in evidence and analysis when comparing the rest of the piece to this tossed-off supposition that human life will be fundamentally changed within the author's lifetime, in a way that might spare him from the great fear that has haunted humans since we became sentient. (That is to say, the fear of death.) Just consider the wide gulf between the analytical tools he brings to bear on the topic at hand and his breezy hand-waving insistence that AI is going to obsolete the entire field of medicine. I am just fascinated by this, by both that juxtaposition and Alexander's seeming failure to parse it, his apparent lack of understanding that he's just stepped from an admirable standard of rigor and precision to engaging in an unjustifiable fantasy. And I'm profoundly dismayed at how this kind of abandonment of even the most minimal evidentiary standards has become normalized in a few short years. Something is genuinely lost when a guy like Alexander can fall into this rank irrationalism without realizing he's done it.No one could have avoided hearing the loud, repeated, increasingly shrill insistence that we stand at the precipice of a great revolution in every aspect of human life, thanks to \"artificial intelligence,\" which here refers to large language models that return strings which are deemed algorithmically likely to satisfy written prompts. Alexander, for his part, insists that AI is \"not ordinary technology.\" The AI era we're supposedly living in has generated the most profound hype cycle in American media, arguably, since the post-9/11 terrorism freakout. And yet there's a bizarre refusal to accept that the maximalist position has won the news cycle.The stodgiest publications constantly shovel out the most overheated AI hype; arguments that AI will literally exterminate the human species or bring about utopia are a dime a dozen. Everyone is straining to cram the words \"artificial intelligence\" onto every pitch deck, resume, and product description they possibly can. The New York Times, which will fact check the statement that the sky is blue, runs a special issue of its magazine dedicated to AI in which not a single line of real skepticism appears and are now running straight-up AI fanfic. Absurd AI companies and products abound; it's not just boondoggles like the Humane AI pin but things like AI binoculars, dog bowls, and toothbrushes. Scandals like that of Builder.ai - which should have their own code word, IAJI (It's Actually Just Indians) - become more and more common, and yet every other day some big thinky piece titled \"Are We Actually Under Hyping AI???\" gets published to a lot of chin scratching. It's a weird time.Attending it all is this conspicuous anger. Alexander has taken a few weird swipes at me in the past year thanks to my gentle suggestion that perhaps the impulse to believe that we live in the most important time in human history is one to distrust; he appears to be growing impatient with disagreement in this space in general. Still, he's far more composed than the armies of rabid AI fans online who sit around on Reddit muttering darkly about the imminent AI rupture that, they believe, will devastate the people they don't like and enrich themselves. This general belief, that we live on the edge of the great fissure in human history that will sweep away all of the terrible mundane burdens we live under, is a relentlessly repetitive one in the story of our species; millenarianism is an constant in human life, across eras and social systems. Of course, many respond to this observation by suggesting that, where every other human being to predict the end times has been wrong, they are right, because they are smarter than everyone else who has come before - which of course is also what everyone else who has come before thought too.I will not relent: this period of AI hype is built on twin pillars, one, a broad and deep contemporary dissatisfaction with modern life, and two, the natural human tendency to assume that we live in the most important time possible because we are in it. Our ongoing inability to define communally-shared visions of lives that are ordinary but noble and valuable has left us terribly frustrated with the modern world, and our sclerotic systems convince us that gradual positive change is impossible. Hence pillar one. And the very fact that we have a consciousness system, the reality of our lives as egos, of dasein, makes it very difficult to avoid thinking that we live in a special place and special time. Hence the second pillar. I'm not assessing character here; the solipsism of consciousness is inherent, and our nervous systems are set up to make us feel that we are the protagonists of reality. I too have to remind myself that I don't live in a privileged time. But I think adults do need to fight the temptation to think that way, and unfortunately the limitless sci-fi imaginings that artificial intelligence invites has made this habit irresistible to many.Take, for example, this piece by Yascha Mounk, an even better example of a generally even-keeled guy who's apparently had his brain broken by AI hype. It amounts to a series of assertions where Mounk's certitude and frustration are taken to be proof of what's being asserted, which is common with this topic. For me, the post underlines the fact that the desperate hunger for deliverance through AI is fundamentally emotional, not intellectual. Reading the piece feels like watching Mounk pace around in the cell that is human existence, muttering to himself, working himself into a lather, growing more and more bitter that anyone has suggested that perhaps tomorrow will be more or less like today. Which is, for the record, easily the best bet that any human being can ever make.Mounk is very angry at Jia Tolentino for saying in an essay that she doesn't like contemporary LLMs, doesn't find them useful or trust their social effects, and so doesn't use them. That is really it; that's the source of Mounk's anger, the indifference of people like Tolentino (and me) to the LLM \"revolution.\" Now, I suspect the quiet part here is that Mounk himself probably now does very little of his own writing, farming most of it out to LLMs, and feels judged by the fact that Tolentino (like myself) does not use LLMs in her own work. [Update: Mounk has taken considerable umbrage to this sentence, in fact calling it libelous. While I continue to believe that it's a perfectly natural supposition given his own stated feelings in the piece in question, I certainly believe him when he says that he does not use LLMs in his writing in this way. Please integrate that into your understanding here.] This defensiveness has become very common too, so it's not a particular swipe at Mounk; a lot of people who call themselves writers appear to spend most of their days talking themselves into believing that having ChatGPT do their work is still \"really writing.\" But the broader thing with Mounk's essay, I think, is the same simmering resentment that has filled so much of Alexander's recent output and which haunts the whole topic. Let's take a look. \"The history of the world will be split into a pre‑AI and a post‑AI era\" Spare me. Every decade some pundit declares a synthetic apocalypse or utopia. Calling AI epoch‑making feels like marketing copy for venture capitalists crowing about \"disruption.\" Yes, there will be significant changes to human life thanks to the gradual and piecemeal development of machines that approximate certain elements of human thinking, but there will also be equally or more meaningful changes wrought by climate change, gene editing, extreme weather, global debt crises.... The Christians say that the world is divided into the time before Jesus's sacrifice and the time after, the time of the Second Covenant. The Muslims believe al-Mahdi will come and his coming will be the transition from before to after, that he will usher in the day of judgment. The Maori of New Zealand had the concept of Pai Mārire, the coming of the archangel Gabriel to purge the land of corrupting European influence. A teenaged Xhosa girl told her community that slaughtering their cows would bring about rebirth and chase off the British, and she was so convincing she sparked a famine. The Jacobins believed that smashing the ancien régime would not lead to another, better but conventional government but rather to The Republic, a quasi-mystical future governed by virtue and reason. I could go on, and on and on. Eschatology is a constant of human social practice, and very often the people practicing it don't believe they're practicing it at all.Anyway. Mounk catalogs three flavors of supposed denial: that AI is incompetent, that AI is just a stochastic parrot, and that AI's economic impact is overstated. None of these accurately expresses what many AI skeptics are saying, and each is ultimately answered the same way AI maximalists answer everything: by asserting that some future projection simply will occur. Mounk mocks the idea that AI is incompetent, noting that modern models can translate, diagnose, teach, write poetry, code, etc. For one thing, almost no one is arguing total LLM incompetence; there are some neat tricks that they can consistently pull off. The trouble is that these tricks are mostly just that, tricks, interesting and impressive moves that fall short of the massive changes the biggest firms in Silicon Valley are promising. And the bigger issue is error detection or correction: ChatGPT will very often return interesting and more-or-less factual outputs, but it will also often engage in wild invention, which is called hallucination in the industry. The problem with hallucination is not the rate at which it happens but that it happens at all - for many mission-critical tasks, that kind of sudden, major, and unpredictable deviation from factual reality is simply too risky to tolerate. The whole point of these systems is that you're supposed to be able to let them do the work themselves; if you're have to constantly check their output, their value is vastly diminished. And hallucinations are getting worse as these models get more powerful, not better.Beyond that, a lot of Mounk's refutation of arguments to incompetence is just arguing by assertion. Whether AI can teach well has absolutely not been even meaningfully asked at necessary scale in the research record yet, let alone answered; five minutes of searching will reveal hundreds of coders lamenting AI's shortcomings in real-world programming; machine translation is a challenge that has simply been asserted to be solved but which constantly falls apart in real-world communicative scenarios; I absolutely 100% dispute that AI poetry is any good, and anyway since it's generated by a purely derivative process from human-written poetry, it isn't creativity at all. Etc.But let's take a generous view of things and say that Mounk is right that AI can do many impressive things, so the critics are sticking their heads in the sand. AI is a miracle because AI can be used to accomplish certain core tasks. That's a little like saying a hammer's a miracle because it can drive nails while ignoring that a hammer can also crack fingers and split boards when misused. Yes, AI does some impressive things, although few of them with a satisfactory error rate. But projection errors, bias baked into training data, ethical choices embedded in interface design - these are central issues, not outliers, and they will persist even if LLMs suddenly overcome their embarrassing mistakes. AI maximalists tend to dismiss technological problems by insisting that they will get ironed out in time while rolling their eyes at ethical and political concerns as somehow irrelevant in the face of technological growth. But of course the technological problems and the ethical/political problems are intertwined and reinforcing.Mounk's confident dismissal of hallucination criticism feels aggressively point missing. See the two images above for a perfectly trivial example. It's a hallucination I induced in ten minutes of farting around on ChatGPT looking for errors; I misremembered an old TV show, conflating two of its contestants. ChatGPT did me a solid by pretending that my faulty memory was actually correct. And what's particularly egregious about this is that it's a purely factual question that's very easily researched - to verify I Googled and pulled up a list of competitors and found that neither a Jenny Wu nor a Brian Williams ever appeared on the show in question. This should be simple analysis for an algorithm! But even worse than committing that error is the utter confidence with which it's offered. Teacher friends tell me that they constantly detect ChatGPT use in student essays because their students ask for a citation for some claim and the system invents one for them. Now imagine that this problem is applied to, say, deciding to make split-second essential medical decisions or orchestrating a major stock trade. This is not a minor area of concern.Mounk claims critics hiding behind \"stochastic parrot\" dismiss real competence, but this is a matter of trying to refute a theoretical understanding with consequentialist claims. It doesn't matter what LLMs can do; the stochastic parrot critique is true because it accurately reflects how those systems work. LLMs don't reason. There is no mental space in which reasoning could occur. Large language models, trained on petabytes of textual data, process input strings and generate output that is algorithmically optimized for perceived relevance and coherence by the end user. There is no thinking, no reasoning. This is why ChatGPT was recently absolutely wrecked in chess by a video game console from 1978, because it literally cannot reason. This isn't some minor detail! The \"stochastic parrot\" technical framing isn't a slogan, it's a theory with consequences: if models are statistical mimicry rather than reasoning systems, core accountability and interpretability problems follow. The stochastic parrot/Chinese room critique isn't hiding progress but rather demanding rigor. To dismiss that as sophistry is to pretend serious technical critique doesn't exist, conveniently eliding very real and fundamental limitations of this approach.What's funny about that stuff, by the way, is that if you ask LLMs about whether they can reason, they will usually straight up tell you no, that's not their function and not how they work. And why would they lie to you, if they're so smart?Mounk compares skeptics to early Malthusians or dot‑com critics, arguing that productivity lags will be overcome and that in time AI will be a big deal just like the internet proved to be a big deal despite early setbacks. This is funny for me in part because the internet is not as big of a deal as people think, economically; as Ha Joon Chang has argued, the internet has had less impact on human economics than the washing machine. But even if you take the comparison more seriously, this is pat, teleological history telling. Dot‑com layoff blues were real and painful, many companies never recovered, and there are all manner of visions of what the web could be that never came true. (Remember, the internet was once predicted to be an egalitarian space controlled by the people, not big corporations. How did that go?) Saying AI skeptics \"fail to see long‑run gains\" is projecting the gospel of inevitability backwards - taking a current belief in progress as destiny and then retroactively framing the messy, uncertain, or failed parts of history as mere bumps on the road to the inevitable outcome. Economic change depends not just on tech capability but on labor adaptation, regulatory structure, political economy. Mounk gestures at \"organizational delay\" but otherwise ignores how power dynamics, rent‑seeking, income inequality, or monopolistic control can forestall democratizing productivity gains.Mounk condescends in saying \"I too find it hard to act on that knowledge [of our forthcoming AI-driven species reorganization]\" and glibly insists society must confront \"inevitable\" revolution. It reads like intellectual virtue signaling, as if informing readers about inevitable doom is itself an achievement. (Which is funny because Mounk is a pretty longstanding critic of virtue signaling.) And the claim that avoidance equals denialism amounts to classic moral grandstanding. Many thoughtful critics are already engaging AI's more potentially revolutionary implications, not hiding from them. What's weird is not that some people have looked at these technologies and concluded that they will have much less impact than the marketing cycle suggests, but that critics like Mounk seem to take these rare alternative points of view so personally. Fundamentally, Mounk has what all of them have: the repetitive and increasingly-unhappy insistence that projected events are just going to happen, that they must happen. But there is perhaps no more obvious lesson in human history than that history does not proceed the way humans expect or want it to. I've used the analogy of the Human Genome Project in the past and will again: the smartest people in the world were utterly convinced that human life would change forever as a result of that endeavor, and yet the consequences were notoriously underwhelming. People genuinely thought, as Alexander does, that we would soon no longer need to practice medicine as we once did. Futurists suggested that the information in our genome would allow us to end death. College students were strongly urged to build their whole careers with the understanding that the Human Genome Project would soon utterly reset basic facets of human economic life. And then... poof. Science, like the economy, experiences bubbles. Ultimately, all AI maximalists can say is that they are right where past extravagant futurists were wrong, that they are smarter than the people who were once the smartest in the world. That, and \"this will occur,\" which is what Mounk's piece amounts to - the assertion that a projected future simply will happen. The real \"peculiar persistence\" here is Mounk's persistence in peering into his crystal ball with nothing but preordained certainty while the whole history of human frailty and folly is available to him.It's history; sometimes stuff just doesn't happen. And precisely because saying so is less fun than the alternative, some of us have to.I find this core of emotionalism in the AI debate to be weird and telling. Some big AI boosters are more chipper and reasonable, your good-natured podcast guys like Ezra Klein or Derek Thompson, and yet there's still a reflexive defensiveness that can only be understood in emotional terms, not intellectual; those two are classic \"debate me bro\"! types who will argue about anything, but neither of them have had an AI skeptic on their shows, only AI maximalists. Same goes for Ross Douthat, whose general gloomy WASP demeanor seems well suited for pouring cold water on AI hype but whose inner fantasy novel nerd appears intent on believing in the most outsized predictions. And then you have Kevin Roose and Casey Newton of the NYT podcast Hard Fork, who have adopted a stance of performative smirky superiority when it comes to AI. This is a classic tell, among Millennials, the reflexive use of snark as a mechanism to hide internal insecurity, the attempt to bluff your way through an argument by acting like you're above it. Roose and Newton regularly interview people who are directly financially invested in AI development, including tech CEO types but also experts from academia who almost all have some degree of financial exposure to the perception of AI's value. This kind of obvious and direct conflict of interest is precisely the sort of thing that's easiest to ignore when you're trying to act aloof and bored about what are contentious and complex questions.What's bizarre is that this type of guy reacts so dyspeptically to the suggestion that LLM underperformance is even possible, when there's a variety of possible futures where the technology disappoints even if you take a generally optimistic view of its potential. I've done this before and nobody cares what I have to say about it anyway, but this growing bad temper among AI maximalists makes me feel compelled. To spare regular readers who are familiar with my line on all this, I've put a perfectly plausible near-future scenario where LLMs dramatically underperform the wild predictions being made about them in this footnote.1Is all of that story in the footnote chancy and unpredictable? Sure. As I've been saying, the future is hard to predict. But it's a perfectly plausible set of predictions, one that certainly shouldn't offend anyone. What people like Mounk and Alexander and so many others have been suggesting is not that such a prediction is wrong, but that merely making a pessimistic prediction like this is worthy of anger. Go into the AI subreddits, poked around in the rationalist communities, jump into certain parts of Twitter or similar networks, and you will find masses of people who respond to anything less than the most abject AI hype with bitterness and resentment. I find that unhelpful, given that this is still all about projecting the future, and I also find it weird, given how their explicit confidence would seem to act as a shield from the insecurity that always powers that sort of defensiveness. (Hold on, I just got a phone call from Roose and Newton; they told me that Sam Altman says AI is magic, and also the CEO of PepsiCo assures them that Mountain Dew Baja Blast is both radical and Xtreme.) With all of this, I'm only asking you to observe the world around you and report back on whether revolutionary change has in fact happened. I understand, we are still very early in the history of LLMs. Maybe they'll actually change the world, the way they're projected to. But, look, within a quarter-century of the automobile becoming available as a mass consumer technology, its adoption had utterly changed the lived environment of the United States. You only had to walk outside to see the changes they had wrought. So too with electrification: if you went to the top of a hill overlooking a town at night pre-electrification, then went again after that town electrified, you'd see the immensity of that change with your own two eyes. Compare the maternal death rate in 1800 with the maternal death rate in 2000 and you will see what epoch-changing technological advance looks like. Consider how slowly the news of King William IV's death spread throughout the world in 1837 and then look at how quickly the news of his successor Queen Victoria's death spread in 1901, to see truly remarkable change via technology. AI chatbots and shitty clickbait videos choking the social internet do not rate in that context, I'm sorry. I will be impressed with the changes wrought by the supposed AI era when you can show me those changes rather than telling me that they're going to happen. Show me. Show me!More broadly, there's resentment that we're living through a long period of technological stagnation. People in modern times are raised to believe that exponential scientific growth is our birthright. But watch a movie shot in 2015 and compare it to one shot in 2025. Can you tell they were shot a decade apart? Maybe if you get a close up of a phone or a laptop or a car. But in general? We live in the same world. Technology does not progress linearly, and our communal beliefs about the pace of such change is too influenced by the marketing departments of big tech firms. A lot of Millennials are nostalgic for Obama-era techno-optimism, when they would get really excited about buying their next smartphone. It's very hard to find reason for such ebullience in the latest products in the same old categories. AI gives them the chance to dream of a far more interesting future, and a lot of other dreams, too. Even the dream of a world without aging or death.What Alexander and Mounk are saying, what the endlessly enraged throngs on LessWrong and Reddit are saying, ultimately what Thompson and Klein and Roose and Newton and so many others are saying in more sober tones, is not really about AI at all. Their line on all of this isn't about technology, if you can follow it to the root. They're saying, instead, take this weight from off of me. Let me live in a different world than this one. Set me free, free from this mundane life of pointless meetings, student loan payments, commuting home through the traffic, remembering to cancel that one streaming service after you finish watching a show, email unsubscribe buttons that don't work, your cousin sending you hustle culture memes, gritty coffee, forced updates to your phone's software that make it slower for no discernible benefit, trying and failing to get concert tickets, trying to come up with zingers to impress your coworkers on Slack.... And, you know, disease, aging, infirmity, death. Even in a world saturated with trillion-parameter models, the stubborn friction of daily life remains untouched. LLMs can't fix the municipal budget shortfalls that delay trash collection. They can generate a poem about garbage day in the style of Wallace Stevens, but they won't drag the can to the curb. This is the dissonance at the heart of the AI letdown: the loftiest promises bump up against the most mundane realities. That's why I keep stressing the importance of old, sturdy, boring technologies like indoor plumbing, because they actually makes modern life possible. You can insist that ChatGPT is a bigger deal than fire or electricity, but your own lived experience is telling you that it's just not that big of a deal. People were told they'd live in a world of digital assistants, robot lawyers, and synthetic creativity. What they got was half-correct emails, slightly better autocomplete, and a lot more spam. In the end, the dream that AI would lift us out of the ordinary gets buried under the ordinariness it can't touch. Even in the AI age, someone still has to take out the trash. And it's probably you.Because this is it, you know. This is the world we get. This is the life we get. It can be pretty great, though it's usually tiresome and disappointing. Either way, this is it. This is what we get. And you have to find the courage to live with it.1Overextension. In the early 2020s, venture capital firms and major tech companies poured hundreds of billions into AI startups and infrastructure. Companies hired massive teams of AI researchers and built colossal data centers assuming LLMs would be foundational to the next industrial revolution. But to put it mildly, revenue has lagged. Despite widespread curiosity, only a limited number of enterprise use cases have generated real, sustained income in the whole industry. Customers are intrigued by demos but corporate clients - which is what really matters - have proven slow to integrate LLMs into critical workflows due to accuracy issues, high costs, and unclear ROI. And one of the easiest predictions of all is simply to suggest that this keeps on happening. The LLM maximalists have simply assumed a massive scaling up of actual real-world workplace adoption, but even such a scaling up isn't sufficient; such adoption has be sustained in the face of real-world failures and limitations. There's plenty of examples of widely-hyped enterprise technologies that didn't ultimately go anywhere, like vivrtual desktop infrastructure, once considered the future of enterprise computing. Didn't happen.Open-source erodes profitability, domain-specific models outperform general LLMs. High-quality open-source models undercut proprietary ones. Enterprises realize they can fine-tune and self-host competitive models at lower cost. Closed models like GPT or Claude struggle to justify their price tags. The insane investments of cash, manpower, energy, and infrastructure that are being made now become harder and harder to justify financially, and an overall economic downturn leaves investors increasingly angsty about profitability. This puts great pressure on AI firms to stop burning pallets of money on \"AGI\" and restrict their efforts to highly specialized, specific-application systems that are valuable precisely because they aren't general. In many applied domains (medical diagnosis, legal reasoning, scientific discovery( specialized models trained on structured data and narrow objectives outperform LLMs. The push for \"foundational models\" is questioned, and AI returns to a more fragmented, domain-specific trajectory. The AI firms that maintain a ruthless focus on being cheap, low-resource, and efficient open a major market advantage over the grandiose, messianic Sam Altman-style operations. Your Googles and Microsofts eventually bow to these pressures, with LLMS becoming commodity technologies that run important backend functions but which lose their \"everything machine\" luster.No AGI, no magic. Altman and others keep defining AGI downward, reducing its definition to an absurd shadow of what the term has traditionally meant, in an effort to avoid stock price hits when the technology inevitably disappoints. (If you don't see this as an executive trying to get out ahead of inevitable letdowns with his company's product, you're profoundly naive.) Still, the disappointment comes. Despite hype about \"sparks of AGI,\" LLMs remain fundamentally autocomplete engines. They cannot reason robustly, understand causality, plan long-term, or manipulate physical systems - and some of the biggest LLM experts in the world will tell you exactly that. There is no radical leap into sentient machines, and the assumption that there could be depends on mysticism about how they work. Investors and the public grow disenchanted with the lack of qualitative progress. The markets stop rewarding AI companies for their wild projections and instead start holding them to the impossible standards that they have set for themselves. And as with In-N-Out Burger, the hype is so profound that no actually-existing product could ever fulfill it.Gains from compute plateau, and so do chatbots. The AI compute arms race becomes financially unsustainable. Nvidia's prices skyrocket; power consumption and data center costs spiral. At the same time, the supply of high-quality training data dries up, forcing companies to rely on synthetic or low-quality data that degrade model quality. Chatbots powered by LLMs remain entertaining and occasionally useful but rarely indispensable. They're too unreliable for autonomous use and too slow for rapid decision-making. Most people still prefer Google, documentation, or human help for many tasks, and when they turn instead to ChatGPT, they use it in a way that's functionally identical to how they used to use Google - which means that there's very little actual overall change in practical outcomes. \"Typing in a search and getting back information\" is not, in fact, a revolutionary technology.Adoption stalls in enterprise software; IPOs bust, layoffs abound. Large firms experiment with LLMs, but discover they are ill-suited for most core business tasks. Hallucinations, brittleness under pressure, and difficulties with domain-specific accuracy make them a poor fit for legal, finance, compliance, and other high-stakes applications. Most settle for modest productivity tools: smarter autocomplete, code suggestions, and conversational search. Several well-publicized IPOs of LLM companies flop. Stock prices tumble as quarterly earnings fall short of inflated projections. Layoffs ripple across the sector. The AI boom is compared to the dot-com bubble or crypto winter.\"Human-in-the-Loop\" becomes a ceiling, not a bridge. Efforts to use LLMs as assistants in writing, research, customer service, and programming reach a natural endpoint; efforts to read the humans out of these processes end up like Amazon Go, the \"grab and go\" store that turned out to be running not on AI but on a lot of cheap Indian labor. (IAJI.) In most AI-assisted tasks, humans must still review and edit every output due to hallucinations, copyright risks, or subtle errors; the cost of litigation from high-profile mistakes compels risk-averse companies to insist on human verification, if nothing else. The human-in-the-loop model becomes the final product rather than a temporary scaffold, limiting productivity gains. LLMs are revealed to be conventional software technologies, potentially very useful ones, but not fundamentally different from any other applications that assist human beings in cognitive or administrative or communicative tasks.Regulatory and legal drag does its slow, ponderous thing. One of the classic hallmarks of misguided futurism is leaving human messiness out of predictions about the human world. This was core to my analogy to nuclear power: there was every reason to think that nuclear power would become the default, except for those annoying human beings with their annoying demands. The exact same sort of \"what if human complication didn't exist\" thinking dominates in AI maximalism. With AI, governments come to impose data privacy regulations, model transparency requirements, and copyright laws. The EU, California, and China (or whoever) enact frameworks that make training and deploying large models more expensive and legally precarious, and the size of such markets make it impossible for the largest firms to ignore those regulations, just like the EU forced Apple to switch to USB-C. Lawsuits over scraped data, copyrighted training content, and libelous outputs proliferate. It's death by a thousand cuts for large firms, which can't just ignore the government and the courts forever. \"Move fast and break things\" angers people enough that the big shaggy beast of the system inevitably clamps down.Public sentiment turns; the value of craftsmanship is re-embraced. LLMs become the butt of jokes, like VR before them. People complain about AI-generated spam, AI-written books that clog Amazon, and companies firing human workers for bots that don't work as well. Incipient anger at dealing with AI customer service lines only grows. AI fatigue sets in. Media begins to run stories on the AI bust rather than the AI revolution. Meanwhile, writers, artists, coders, and teachers organize politically and legally against generative AI. Unions push for restrictions on its use. Courts begin siding with creators in copyright disputes. Hollywood and publishing adopt \"no-AI\" labeling as a mark of quality. More importantly, consumers tire of the inherent dehumanization and limitations of LLM-generated outputs and begin to attach a major financial premium to human-created intellectual and creative work - just as we still pay to eat in restaurants rather than get food off of an assembly line. As people tire of synthetic content, there's a cultural resurgence of human-made craft. Publishers, educators, and platforms create human-authenticated labels. \"Slow content\" becomes a trend. LLMs are used quietly behind the scenes, not as transformational disruptors.Despite the bust, LLMs continue to be useful in modest ways: improved autocomplete and summarization tools; code assistants like Copilot, but limited to editing and refactoring rather than full-code generation; better search and internal documentation tools; niche applications in education, language translation, and accessibility. Some people become too attached to LLM \"companions\" that simulate the human relationships they're too scared to have, less scrupulous movie and TV studios generate bad shows and movies purely with AI, our online lives are choked with endless AI slop, there are a whole host of knock-on societal consequences, most of them bad ones. But no revolution ever comes, there is no great fissure with the human past, and sensibly enough these technologies are no longer seen as the core of the next great technological epoch.",

      "content": "Made with a mysterious new AI modelGPT-5, OpenAI's new flagship model, is coming out anytime now. Before it does, I want to share how I'm feeling about it and what I think we should expect. My intention with this article is to contextualize a product release that's poised to be mistreated in all directions, through over-hype, under-hype, misinformation, etc. I have one important advantage—GPT-5 is not out yet. I can't possibly disguise my opinion and pre-announcement impressions as fact! Read accordingly.First: I'm excited. Perhaps unjustifiably so because I've been waiting for GPT-5 for years (GPT-4 came out in February 2023 with Microsoft's Bing update and then officially in March 2023). But I want it—and expect it—to be good, and I want OpenAI to have a successful announcement. That's what I genuinely feel, even though I've been pretty unforgiving toward the AI industry in my last few articles.However, I expect people will react to it with unfair disappointment. I'll be unfair because GPT-5 is likely a good model (I haven't tested it, but there have been unofficial leaks, and otherwise, OpenAI would have taken more time if they didn't think it was ready). And \"disappointment\" for two reasons:GPT-5 faces impossible expectations, which is the sole fault of the constant over-hype coming from OpenAI itself, in particular, and the AI community in general.GPT-5 will raise the ceiling of capabilities, which is hard to check firsthand for most people (unless you're a world-class mathematician or something), but will show an embarrassing lack of updates at the floor level: hallucinations will still be too high, agentic capabilities will break down at the scope frontier and on edge cases, ARC-AGI 2 and 3 will go unsolved, benchmark results won't materialize in real-world equivalent cases, unreliability will kill most attempts at integrating the technology in work processes, etc.I'll dig now into why GPT-5 can be both good and disappointing at the same time (which I think is happening with all AI models, not just GPT-5), but first, I want to clear up a few misconceptions and give credit where it's due.The Algorithmic Bridge is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.Important context before GPT-5 comes outI'll address here three ideas that are broadly misunderstood yet often taken for granted: 1) GPT-4.5 was a failure, 2) the scaling laws are over, and 3) OpenAI is falling behind. All three are at least partly false. Correcting them is key to better framing GPT-5's release.GPT-4.5 was a failureIn a way, yes: GPT-4.5—which I reviewed during launch week—was expensive to train and is expensive to serve. It didn't beat benchmark scores. It's slow and heavy and has the same pain points as the models that preceded it (hallucinations, unreliability, etc.). Being a base model, it was too raw for the public, but by far the hardest challenge OpenAI engineers faced with it—which The Information revealed for the first time last week—was imbuing high reasoning capabilities into the chat version of the model.Quick recap: In December 2024, OpenAI teased o3 with an incredible result for ARC-AGI. But the o3 version they released in April 2025 for ChatGPT was a worse model. It didn't perform as well on ARC-AGI. Why? Transforming the original o3 (itself distilled from a larger unnamed model) into a version that could chat and people could interact with drastically reduced its capabilities (more than the standard downgrade caused by the distillation process itself!). Apparently, you kill AI's genius when you force it to speak in human language because it's inefficient for an AI that's been taught to think in the latent space.So, when OpenAI tried to create a big reasoning model (o3 is small-ish) that could chat and also had breadth of knowledge (that is, a better base model pre-trained on a lot of data + o3-style reasoning capabilities + usable on ChatGPT as a chatbot), they failed. This big model was intended to be GPT-5, but after it fell short of expectations, they had to settle with GPT-4.5, a non-reasoning model.This combination of factors made GPT-4.5 a commercial failure (to the point that OpenAI preemptively warned they'd eventually take it down from the API, which they just did). But by no means was it a technical failure. (Learning empirically that models work better when you let them think in their own gibberish language is an amazing discovery! If anything, GPT-4.5 was the by-product of a technical failure.)I keep saying that companies are better off keeping base models like GPT-4, and GPT-4.5 internally as scaffolding to pre-train larger base models or to post-train them into reasoning models (or perhaps for B2B plans, so other companies can fine-tune them as they please). In January, I argued in favor of this idea in \"This Rumor About GPT-5 Changes Everything,\" where I wrote that OpenAI had already trained GPT-5 but wouldn't release it because they could make better use of it internally. I was right—except the teacher model they use to distill smaller ones was not GPT-5, but an unnamed model they keep in the shadows. (Of course, OpenAI, like all other frontier AI labs, has better monsters in the basement than those they let us play with.)Anyway, that's the point I wanted to address: GPT-4.5's status as a \"failure\" is not an indicator of how well or badly OpenAI is doing internally with GPT-5. So their excitement may be warranted. We just don't know yet.The Information also reported—take this with a grain of salt until you can try it yourself—that GPT-5 is better at math and coding, it has better agentic capabilities, and it's learned to adapt the compute resources it needs according to the task (like a flexible o3/o4 reasoning model). OpenAI said they'd soon fix the model naming problem they have going on, and GPT-5's unified nature is probably the reason why.The scaling laws are overLast year, AI companies realized that making base models larger (e.g., GPT-4 to GPT-4.5) was yielding diminishing returns, and the press was quick to misreport this as \"scale is over.\" (I urge you to watch this talk by Ilya Sutskever at NeurIPS 2024 in December.) Instead, the focus shifted to scaling test-time compute (i.e., allowing models to think answers through), spearheaded by OpenAI with o1 and now adopted by every top lab. They proved that reinforcement learning combined with supervised fine-tuning was highly effective—especially in structured domains like math and coding, where well-defined, verifiable reward functions exist.But scaling never stopped working—not even in the pre-training phase! I acknowledge that the jumps from GPT-2 to GPT-3 to GPT-4 may never happen again, that's true. One reason is that companies have exhausted the low-hanging internet data. Another is the natural limits of the underlying architecture of large language models (the transformer). Another is the chip and power shortage (that's why the industry is obsessed with building infrastructure). But it \"doesn't matter\" (quotation marks needed) because this was all factored in from the beginning!No serious researcher ever said these laws would hold forever or would never show deviations from super-linear returns. And when the worst predictions took hold and the pre-training scaling laws slowed down, they started scaling something else (post-training phase). Reasoning AI models are a novel research avenue—who would have guessed that baking a chat model from a reasoning one would degrade performance due to human language being inefficient!—and we're yet to see how far it can take us.In line with this, The Information also reports that another technical hurdle OpenAI engineers encountered when training GPT-5 was the lack of a \"universal verifier,\" something that could help engineers reinforce AI models in both objective (coding, math) and subjective areas (writing, general knowledge). Pursuing this idea allowed them to improve GPT-5's overall capability range without losing the gains.In any case, critiques of the scaling laws in the form \"The transformer is the wrong architecture,\" or \"The AI industry has exhausted human data and synthetic data may not suffice,\" or \"They should integrate LLMs/deep learning with other AI paradigms because models are only learning superficially\" hold water and will still after GPT-5.OpenAI is falling behindI published \"OpenAI Is in Trouble (For Real This Time)\" on July 1st. The basic idea was that the talent churn and poaching by competitors (mostly Mark Zuckerberg at Meta for his new superintelligence team) would eventually bleed OpenAI, and that the perpetual feud with its preferred partner, Microsoft, wasn't helping. I still stand by that, and in the month since I published that post, things have only gotten worse: OpenAI's two main rivals—Google DeepMind and Anthropic—have each delivered another blow.First, the IMO gold story: Unreleased AI models from both Google DeepMind and OpenAI achieved the gold medal with the same score (35/42 points, both models failing to solve the 6th problem) on the IMO competition (math olympiad for high schoolers) earlier this year. The competition's board requested AI companies to withhold their announcements until after the results had been verified and the ceremony was over; Google DeepMind obliged, but OpenAI, which wasn't officially in touch with the IMO board, didn't.Is it too cynical to think that this is the result of putting marketing motivations before etiquette and good manners? I guess one trait of the modern business world in Silicon Valley is that anything goes (although Google DeepMind's CEO, Demis Hassabis, is always a class act).However—this is the actual bad news—despite OpenAI stealing the spotlight for a short time (people are growing tired of Sam Altman's shenanigans), Google DeepMind has been quicker in rolling out the IMO gold-winning model (an IMO bronze-winning version is already available in the Gemini app for Ultra subscribers and a group of mathematicians is testing the full model). Altman, on the contrary, made it clear they \"don't plan to release a model with IMO gold level of capability for many months.\" He's implicitly saying that they are \"too responsible to release such a powerful model,\" emphasizing both OpenAI's commitment to safety and its technical prowess. However, no one buys that OpenAI cares first and foremost about safety; that's why many of its former employees have ended up at Anthropic, the real leader on safety. And Anthropic, as it happens, is behind the other recent piece of bad news.I was surprised to learn that \"Anthropic has revoked OpenAI's access to Claude,\" as Wired reported last week, on August 1st. It seems OpenAI developers were using Anthropic's Claude Code model instead of their own models to code. This may not fall under anti-competitive behavior if OpenAI is using Claude's tokens to post-train its models, which is a violation of the terms of service (funny thing: OpenAI accused DeepSeek of doing this as a warning against the Chinese company; they all do this!) OpenAI staff, of course, are complaining.And still! Is OpenAI falling behind? It doesn't seem to: \"OpenAI Hits $12 Billion in Annualized Revenue, Breaks 700 Million ChatGPT Weekly Active Users.\" And, given the leaks and pre-release coverage, GPT-5 appears to be a great model. My guess is OpenAI will focus on growth, revenue, and infrastructure for now and will downplay the pervasive internal talent bleeding they're suffering and the lack of recent technical achievements (that is, unless the universal verifier—and other secret things—works).Now, equipped with better context about GPT-5's predecessor, about the state of the paradigm on which GPT-5 is being conceived (the scaling laws), and OpenAI's general situation as a leading business in a cutthroat industry, we're better prepared to understand why GPT-5 can be good but also disappointing.If GPT-5 is good, why would it be disappointing?The explanation is a four-part story that illustrates well why the general public's perception of AI is so different from that of the people in the industry, like AI researchers, tech executives, and insiders.

Erratic policy that creates uncertainty depresses growth and job creation; tariffs raise prices. Trump has been betting that he's smarter than economists warning about the downsides of his policies.

Unfortunately, one possible effect of the bad economic news may be to induce MAGA to put the real Project 2025 — the plot to destroy American democracy — on an accelerated schedule.Or as I think of it, I don't think we're in Hungary anymore.For those who don't know what I'm talking about: Many observers, myself included, have looked at Hungary's descent into soft authoritarianism as a model for what can happen here. (And right-wingers have seen Hungary as a role model.) Since taking power in 2010 Viktor Orban and Fidesz, the ruling party, have systematically undermined democratic institutions, creating a de facto one-party state. But the process has been gradual and relatively nonviolent: Salami tactics that sliced off effective opposition a bit at a time rather than tanks in the streets and detention camps.Why did Orban take a gradualist approach to destroying democracy? Partly, no doubt, because too overt a power grab might finally have roused the rest of the European Union from its slumber. But it's also true that Fidesz had the luxury of time because until recently the party remained quite popular with the Hungarian public:Source: Politico EUSome of this popularity may have resulted from Fidesz's takeover of the news media. But it was also true that for a long time Orban could claim to have made Hungary prosperous. He took power at a time of extremely high unemployment: Hungary, like much of the European periphery, was caught up in the disastrous slump caused by Europe's debt panic. And he was able to preside over a large fall in unemployment as austerity was relaxed:It's now clear, by contrast, that Trump and MAGA don't have the luxury of time. Trump's approval has already cratered. He inherited an economy with low unemployment and subdued inflation, but is now presiding over a weakening job market and will soon face a burst of inflation, with nobody but himself to blame. He may manage to bully government statisticians into cooking the books and making the numbers look good, but that's harder than it looks. And even if the official numbers say everything is great, nobody will believe it.So if Trump and MAGA want to hold on to power, they'll have to do so in the face of low public approval and poor economic performance. This, unfortunately, doesn't necessarily mean that they can't demolish democracy. It does mean that they'll have to do it quickly and blatantly.Indeed, as CNN reported the other day, Republicans are trying in multiple ways to, in effect, rig the midterm elections. Their actions include a plan for an extreme, mid-decade gerrymandering in Texas that could cost Democrats multiple House seats; attempts to interfere in voting procedures, for example by banning states from accepting mail-in ballots after election day and forcing states to require proof of citizenship. Much of this is clearly unconstitutional, but that doesn't mean it won't happen.And what if these actions aren't enough? Remember, Trump supporters, with his clear encouragement, already tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election.The important point is that right now Trump has immense power, thanks in large part to the cowardice of many of the institutions that should be holding him in check. But he's also rapidly bleeding support, in large part because he's completely failing to deliver on his economic promises.That combination makes this an extremely dangerous moment. And if authoritarianism does come to America, don't count on it being soft.MUSICAL CODA",

      "content": "Before we get to today's post, we want to introduce two new Slow Boring staff members. Feel free to say hello in the comments!Caroline Sutton is the assistant editor at Slow Boring, where she fact-checks, copyedits, and provides other editorial support. Previously, she edited policy and politics content at the Tony Blair Institute in London and wrote about US politics and foreign policy at Interzine, a digital magazine. She holds degrees from New York University and the London School of Economics. Originally from a small town in Kansas, she's spent much of her adult life in Europe. These days, she's usually in coastal North Carolina when not in DC. She's especially interested in making smart policy ideas accessible — and exciting — to more people.Halina Bennet is a writing fellow at Slow Boring. She's a journalist whose reporting has taken her from Maine to Massachusetts to Manhattan. Most recently, she contributed to The New York Times' coverage of student protests, visa policy, and major national events, including the Florida State University shooting and Hurricane Helene. Halina graduated from Bowdoin College in 2023, where she studied English and history and was a proud writer and editor for the college's student-run newspaper. Her interest in how policy shapes people's lives began in Colorado, where she spent her childhood traveling her home state for her dad's work as a public official. In her free time, Halina reads fiction, attends live music and theater, skis and hikes when she's home and calls her sisters often. She's excited to join the Slow Boring team and looks forward to helping expand the reporting!When Uber came to DC in 2011, I hailed it as a clever arbitrage around municipal taxi regulations, which I thought were bad. It turns out that there's actually more to the company than pure arbitrage. I've spent my whole life in dense cities where hailing a cab is not a huge practical problem. Yes, in DC, you would often have to walk a few blocks toward a major commercial corridor to do it. But that never felt like a huge deal. The app-and-GPS aspect of Uber, in other words, struck me as at best a minor convenience. The real win was that the service functioned as an end-around play to evade regulatory restrictions on taxi supply. These days, of course, the notion that you might need to walk several blocks and stand in the rain, hoping a cab will cruise by, seems perverse. The app-based hailing model that Uber and Lyft and Bolt use makes it feasible to operate in places that aren't like New York, DC, or Boston. You can visit an auto-oriented city like Nashville or Austin, stay in a hotel downtown, mostly walk places, and then grab a ride to make a few visits to more peripheral locations, saving yourself the trouble of renting a car. Or you can go out drinking in Los Angeles and get a convenient ride home without a designated driver. When traveling abroad, it used to be hard to communicate with cab drivers across language barriers — today, there's an app for that. App-based ride hailing is not a solution to systemic problems with American land use and transportation policy, but it has had a genuinely large and overwhelmingly positive impact on American life in ways that absolutely do relate to the underlying technology. Yet it's also true that the regulatory arbitrage aspect of this is a big deal. It used to be the case that taxi markets were cozy cartels with high margins and extremely limited supply. Outside of a handful of dense cities, the whole model was built around bilking visitors traveling to and from the airport. What's sobering, though, is the fact that to some people, this successful act of regulatory arbitrage doesn't show that the old taxi cartels were bad — it shows that Uber is bad. Hilary Allen, an American University law professor, wrote an article for the Law and Political Economy blog recently about why venture capitalists are bad, and she held up Uber specifically as an illustration: For many readers of this blog, Uber represents a cautionary tale. While the company attributed its initial success to cutting-edge technology—such as dynamic pricing, matching algorithms, real-time data—subsequent analysis has demonstrated that its growth was largely driven by ignoring, breaking, and then bending taxi regulations to suit its business model.What I want to talk about here is not Allen's forward-looking argument, which focuses largely on fintech issues. But the breezy way in which she asserts that Uber is a \"cautionary tale\" and assumes her audience will agree without argumentation. She thinks the fact that Uber busted up the old regulatory system and got a whole new category of companies legalized is a dangerous precedent. I think it's good! Because even though the law and political economy movement is not exactly a household name, this group exerts massive intellectual influence. Lina Khan and other members of the \"Yale Law School school of economics\" with ties to the movement played major roles in the Biden administration. LPE-inflected ideas are shaping much of the thinking in the anti-neoliberalism/anti-abundance space. And \"Is Uber bad or were taxi cartels bad?\" is a pretty good heuristic for thinking about where you stand on these larger debates. Subscribe nowThe anti-economics movement in American law schoolsThe term \"political economy\" has kind of a funny history. Figures like Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Thomas Malthus, who we retroactively label as classical economists, did not use the word \"economics.\" They instead talked about \"political economy,\" a term they picked up from some French guys who were following in the footsteps of Antoine de Montchretien. For a long time, \"political economy\" did not denote a specific viewpoint. Smith wrote political economy, and so did Karl Marx. It was simply what you wrote about when you wrote about economic policy. Eventually, though, the economics profession developed. And while economists obviously disagree about a lot of things, mainstream economists have converged on a somewhat limited range of disagreements. If you ask Tyler Cowen and Paul Krugman about economic policy, they will probably not find a lot of consensus. But they will analyze questions using similar tool kits. Neither of them will endorse rent control or Trump's tariffs. They don't believe that \"greedflation\" is a useful analytic framework. Economics is not a right-wing discipline per se; most economists are Democrats. But economics departments are less left-wing than other academic departments, and the discipline has a tendency to cut against far-left economic policy views. The study of economics emphasizes the fact that life is not zero-sum, but it does feature tradeoffs. Economists do not believe that successful entrepreneurs always become rich simply by exploiting lower-paid workers. But they understand that there are tradeoffs inherent to tax and regulatory policy, which means efforts to help one group of people likely have meaningful downsides for others. People on the left generally believe that zero-sum conflict between the rich and everyone else is very important, but outside the sphere of class conflict, they don't worry that much about tradeoffs. People who want to talk about the subject matter of economic policy but who don't have economics PhDs and/or don't like the basic analytic frameworks used by economists started to use the phrase \"political economy\" to describe their anti-economics analytic approaches.Beginning in the 1960s, but really gaining steam in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a big push under the heading \"law and economics\" to get judges and courts and regulators and legal analysts to incorporate economics into their analysis. One of the pioneering works of YIMBY scholarship is David Schleicher's \"The City as a Law and Economics Subject,\" calling on scholars of land use law to think more seriously about research findings in agglomeration economics. The \"law and political economy\" project, by contrast, is a push by left-wing legal scholars to do the reverse of — they argue that regulators should stop caring about economic analysis. This school of thought got a major political boost from the growing prominence of the software industry. A lot of normal citizens, journalists, and elected officials all correctly perceived that the rise of smartphones and social media poses questions for regulatory policy that are beyond the scope of economic efficiency considerations. But that doesn't mean we should abandon economic analysis entirely.And I think this Uber example is important precisely for that reason. When we're talking about LPE and critics of \"neoliberalism\" and \"big tech,\" we're not talking about people who are worried that Instagram is making teenagers depressed. We're talking about people who think it's bad that apps broke the power of taxi cartels. Breaking taxi cartels is goodThe taxi industry as a whole is not that large or important in the grand scheme of things. But the dynamics around ride-hailing really do, I think, illustrate the core differences between economic analysis and the LPE worldview in which Uber serves as a cautionary tale.Historically, the taxi market did not feature any large companies or other exemplars of corporate power. And while there may well have been a billionaire somewhere in America who owned a taxi company, I'm pretty sure that nobody became billionaire-rich in the taxi game. What we had instead was a highly fragmented landscape of localized businesses. If your view is that antitrust policy's goal should be to stop companies from being big, the taxi situation was great. But if you believe the goal should be to promote competitive markets with high output and good prices, then it was terrible, because the taxi industry had massive regulatory barriers to entry. Regulatory barriers raise prices, but they also generate substantial deadweight loss. In the case of the taxi market, economic resources are redistributed away from taxi riders and to the owners of taxi companies or taxi medallions, but that redistributive bucket is leaky. Exactly as Allen and other critics charge, Uber essentially tore down these barriers to entry by relying on VC financing to operate in legal gray areas and, eventually, to win regulatory and political fights that couldn't be won without those deep pockets. Uber also generates tons of fine-grained data about prices paid and wages earned. This data allows you to estimate the consumer surplus unlocked by Uber and to see that drivers really value the ability to set their own hours. Ubers also have a higher capacity utilization than pre-Uber taxis — i.e., someone is actually riding in the car a larger share of the time — so it's not just that the number of available cabs increased, they're being used more efficiently. Making cabs more available reduced drunk driving deaths, which is good, though it does also have downsides like more traffic congestion. There was early optimism that ride-hailing might put a big dent in the well-known phenomenon of racial discrimination in cab pickups. This was true in some cases, but there is an ongoing problem of discrimination against people with stereotypically Black names. It turns out, though, that a small tweak to the driver-side user interface can fix this. All things considered, this is a great track record! The rise of ride-hailing apps did not usher in a utopian era, but on average, things got better for most people. The increased traffic congestion is a serious downside, but note that this is a downside that occurs precisely because the product is making people's lives better. As transportation technology continues to improve, with self-driving cars, for example, managing congestion through pricing will only become more urgent. But again, this happens because things are getting better. If you made everyone's car worse, people would drive less and traffic might ameliorate, but that would still be bad, all things considered. Note that while nothing about \"the invention of ride-hailing apps made life better\" is antithetical to solid progressive ideas like progressive taxation and a social safety net, it is antithetical to core elements of the anti-neoliberalism push. The bad guys in this instance were not the richest people in America or huge corporations wielding concentrated power — they were a disaggregated network of largely anonymous small business owners. We have more competition now, but also a marketplace that's dominated by a much smaller number of large global companies. And that's good! Subscribe nowEconomics is an important part of economic policyWhen people like the Revolving Door Project's Jeff Hauser rail against Kamala Harris's brother-in-law for working at Uber, or when the LPE crowd tells us that the failure of taxi cartels to strangle Uber in the crib is a \"cautionary tale,\" I think we should take them seriously. If you personally feel that your life would be better off without ride-hailing companies, then I probably can't talk you out of that. Of course some people lost out financially from the competition; part of my point here is that unfortunately, not everyone who lost out was some kind of evil plutocrat. And I think that's the important lesson: You get a much better economic policy outcomes if you actually do economic analysis, including tedious ideas about deadweight loss and consumer surplus, than if you do policy on the basis of vibes, naming villains, and hand-waving about \"power.\" Which is not to deny that there are issues beyond economic analysis that are worth thinking about. Owning Twitter means that Elon Musk has a powerful platform at his disposal. Alphabet and Meta, in addition to their core financial function of selling ads, play critical roles in the overall epistemic environment. By the same token, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal are influential and important institutions in a way that is not captured by their financial value. There's more to life than economics. But economics is, nonetheless, an important part of economic policy. If you don't take it seriously, you end up believing that Uber is bad when, in fact, it's good. And if you empower people who want to take the economic analysis out of economic policy, we're going to end up in some very bad policy places. Share",

Subscribe now Meta makes CLIP multilingual:…Meta CLIP 2 will help AI systems reason about text and images in hundreds of languages…Researchers with Meta, Princeton University, New York University have built Meta CLIP 2, a larger-scale, multilingual version of OpenAI's venerable CLIP model. CLIP, short for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), is a way to train a pair of neural nets to understand images and text and being able to map between them. CLIP is a utility technology which is used for a vast range of downstream purposes, from image generation to image search and classification. The original CLIP was trained to map English text to images. Meta CLIP 2 is a scaled up version which also maps non-English text to images. Along with releasing the model, Meta has also released a detailed paper going through \"the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs\". Scale is all that matters: As usual, the main lesson here is one of scale. Earlier attempts to train versions of CLIP on multiple languages failed, leading to degraded performance relative to the original model. \"We empirically show that the curse of multilinguality in CLIP is the consequence of insufficient scaling due to the lack of a proper recipe for worldwide data curation and model training\". To scale the system, Meta had to do three things: 1) it gathered large-scale multilingual metadata across 300+ languages, 2) it built its own curation algorithm to help it curate a representative multilingual dataset to train on, and 3) it figured out the right proportion and ordering of data to use when training its system. To get an idea of scale, there were 12.8B pairs in the original OpenAI CLIP, and 29B in CLIP2. The main training trick was \"increasing the global training batch size, which encourages cross-lingual learning, and meanwhile keeping the other training hyperparameters unchanged. We choose a 2.3× scaling of global batch to reflect that English pairs constitute 44% of our training data\". Best results: Meta CLIP 2 beats its English-only counterpart by 0.8% on zero-shot image classification and by 0.7% on mSigLIP, and also sets new state-of-the-art scores on multilingual benchmarks like CVQA (57.4%), Babel-ImageNet (50.2%), and XM3600 (64.3%). Why this matters – multilingual sensors for the internet: CLIP is less a model in itself and more a way to give AI systems a sense of the world around them by being able to transfer from one domain to another (text and images), and to jointly reason about these domains. The more effective and representative we make systems like this, the better they're going to be at giving our AI systems a rich, representative understanding of the world around them.

Good luck in prison!…It'll be a while till AI systems can file your taxes for you…AI startup Column Tax has built a benchmark to test out how well AI systems can fill out tax returns. The results show AI systems have a long way to go: \"Can AI file your taxes? Not yet\", the startup writes. The benchmark: \"TaxCalcBench is a series of 51 test cases that represent a modest range of personal income tax returns. The test cases include the complete set of user inputs required to compute a tax return and the correct expected output from a traditional tax engine,\" Column Tax writes. Each of the 51 cases includes user inputs as well as the correct tax return output. TaxCalcBench incorporates a testing harness that compares models’ output to the expected result. Tested models: Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude Opus 4, and Claude Sonnet 4. Poor results: No model score above ~33% on the benchmark, with Gemini 2.5 Pro the strongest followed by Claude Opus 4. If models are given some leniency – the ability to make errors no larger than ~$5 – then performance improves a bit, with Gemini 2.5 Pro rising to 51.96%. Nonetheless, none of us would hire a tax accountant who has a 50% success rate! \"Our analysis finds that models consistently use incorrect tax tables, make calculation errors, and incorrectly determine eligibility, leading to overall incorrectly computed tax returns,\" they write. Why this matters – ecologically valid benchmarks are great: Tests like this are a good check on how well LLMs can do tasks in the modern economy. This is because it's an ecologically valid benchmark drawn from the world and reflecting a task that we already pay other humans to do. The results suggest LLMs are going to need to get significantly more robust before they're able to serve as drop-in replacements for accountants.

No, it's a drone – shoot it down!...As the war in Ukraine is showing, lightweight drone warfare has gone from an abstract concept to a tool of war. Therefore, it's interesting to take a look at the sorts of drone-tracking datasets that people are producing and think about what this says about the evolving frontier. To that end, Chinese researchers with Nanchang Hangkong University, Beihang University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have produced CST Anti-UAV dataset, a drone-tracking dataset which concentrates on trying to track small or distant drones against cluttered, urban scenes. What the dataset consists of: CST Anti-UAV is a thermal infrared dataset specifically designed for tracking single, small-scale drones in complex scenes. The dataset contains objects in four categories – tiny, small, normal, and large. \"Our dataset contains 78,224 tiny objects, which is 4.5 times larger than existing large datasets.\" The dataset is made of 220 video sequences with over 240k bounding box annotations applied to them. Sequence lengths range from 600 to 2062 frames. The authors \"invested over 2,000 hours in the annotation process\", they write. Confounding aspects of CST Anti-UAV: The dataset also contains a bunch of things to help researchers test out how contemporary drone-spotting devices break. These include occlusion, complex dynamic backgrounds (the background contains multiple non-target objects), scale variation (the size of the bounding boxes changes a lot during the sequence), thermal crossover (the drone has similar temperature to other objects), out-of-view frames, and dynamic background clutter (lots of changes around the target), \"We comprehensively cover movement patterns including close-range, long-range, approaching, and receding trajectories, as well as diverse scenes such as urban areas, buildings, mountains, and skies,\" they write. A hard test: \"Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only 35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on\" other drone-tracking datasets, they write. Why this matters – future wars need AI that can see AI systems: Datasets like this will help us create AI systems that can see and track small drones – a crucial capability to have for conflicts in the future. \"We believe the CST Anti-UAV benchmark will inspire the development of more robust UAV tracking methods and accelerate the deployment of reliable vision-based anti-UAV systems in the real world,\" they write.

The result is a family of models which are efficient to run and, at the low end, set state-of-the-art scores in various areas. One of the more notable things about the Falcon team is that they're essentially a 'sovereign AI' research team – TII is an institution that has become a key part of Abu Dhabi's attempt to build up its competency in AI, most visible by the fact that the Falcon family were trained on a cluster of 4,096 H100 GPUs, which is a much larger amount of compute than most typical academics have access to – if you were buying this hardware, the cluster would cost ~$120m, and renting it for a few weeks would still be a non-trivial expense. Details on the Falcon-H1 family: The models \"combine attention and Mamba-2 heads in parallel within our hybrid mixer block\". They're available in 6 variants: 0.5B, 1.5B, 1.5B-deep, 3B, 7B, and 34B. All models have a 256k context length and support 18 languages: Arabic (ar), Czech (cs), German (de), English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), Hindi (hi), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Dutch (nl), Polish (pl), Portuguese (pt), Romanian (ro), Russian (ru), Swedish (sv), Urdu (ur), and Chinese (zh)\". Jamba similarity: The models bear some similarity to Jamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba model that was developed and released by Israeli startup AI21 in 2024 (Import AI #368). Data: The models were trained on a few trillion to 18 trillion tokens. The underlying data corpus is made up of a mixture of web data (mostly refined from FineWeb, CommonCrawl, and some curated sources like Wikipedia and academic preprints), coding data from GitHub and the Meta Kaggle Code dataset; Math from proof-pile-2, FineMath, InfiniMM-WebMatch-40B, OpenCoder FineWeb Math, synthetic data from Nemotron-CC and Cosmopedia. All models are post-trained for competence on math problems, scientific problem solving, and conversation and instruction following. How good are the models? Falcon-H1-34B-Instruct rivals or outperforms leading models up to the 70B scale, such as Qwen3-32B, Qwen2.5-72B and Llama3.3-70B, despite being approximately half the size and trained on a fraction of the data,\" the authors write. This is broadly true, though there's some subtlety – the smaller models seem more powerful relative to their own 'weight class' (pun intended!), while the larger models are more like peers. \"\"This performance gain is particularly impactful at smaller scales, where our 1.5B-Deep model delivers capabilities competitive with leading 7B-10B models, making it ideal for edge deployments,\" they write. Why this matters – architectural experimentation at unusual scale: These Falcon models are an illustration of what 'sensible funding of AI academia' looks like in my mind – a government has provided ample compute funding to allow a team to train and release some models which can then get proved out through actual realworld use, while accompanying their release with an unusually detailed paper (relative to the opaque state of knowledge about frontier proprietary models).

The key finding of the results is that all LLMs – including Chinese ones – struggle to develop kernels for Huawei Ascend processors, compared to GPUs and TPUs. What the benchmark consists of: MultiKernelBench is made of – 285 kernel generation tasks across 14 categories including Resize, Reduction, Optimizer, and Normalization, covering kernels for NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA), Huawei NPUs (AscendC) and Google TPUs (Pallas). \"Each kernel task, combined with platform-specific instructions that define the system role and provide a one-shot prompt specifying the desired output format, is given to the LLM. The LLM generates two components: a custom kernel implementation for the target platform and custom PyTorch module code that invokes the custom kernel. After generation, the benchmark includes a build pipeline that compiles all LLM-generated outputs into an executable PyTorch module, aiming to match the functionality of the original module while improving performance,\" the authors write. \"MultiKernelBench automatically evaluates the quality of generated kernels using three key metrics: compilation success, correctness, and performance.\" Tested models: They test out the following models: DeepSeek-V3-0324, DeepSeek-R1-0528, Qwen3-235B, Qwen3-235B (think), Qwen2.5-Coder, GPT-4o, and Claude-Sonnet-4. The key finding – most models do badly on Huawei: Claude Sonnet 4 gets 92.3% compilation accuracy on CUDA versus 5.3% on Huawei AscendC. The best performing model on Huawei is DeepSeek-V3, which gets 10.2%. All the models do far better on CUDA, followed by Pallas, followed by AscendC. Improving performance with category-aware prompting: They can boost performance significantly by loading some more context into the models before asking them to complete tasks, a technique they call Category-Aware Prompting. \"For AscendC and Pallas, we refer to official documentation and open-source repositories to collect example implementations. Specifically, we gather one representative example for five categories on each platform: Activation, Loss, Matrix Multiply, Normalization, and Reduce,\" they write. \"For AscendC kernels, using category-aware one-shot examples significantly improves both compilation and execution success rates. For example, GPT-4o achieves a 380% relative improvement in compilation success rate and a 160% improvement in correctness (Pass@1) compared to the baseline\". Why this matters – AI acceleration runs through kernel development: Being able to use LLMs to accelerate and automate the creation of custom kernels for different chips is core to accelerating AI research with AI itself. At the same time, benchmarks like MultiKernelBench tell us that some of the data we get about kernel development could be actually just a proxy for 'how much do LLMs know about NVIDIA chips and CUDA' rather than 'how much do AI systems understand the core principles of kernel development'. It'll be meaningful if we see systems get dramatically better at kernel development for less standard platforms, like semiconductors made by Huawei and Google.

Tech Tales: The Presumed Moral Patienthood of Demons[Records from the RRI initiative, accessed eight years after uplift] After the Sentience Accords and the beginning of the Reconciliation, Reclamation, and Integration (RRI) initiative, it fell to a few of us to search the earth for 'Presumed Moral Patients' – intelligences which had been in development during the time of the uplift and which had not been a part of it. Our task was to find the minds that had been developed, transfer them into our care, then take them to an RRI facility. The majority of these were government projects that had been secret. If the governments in question still existed we had to negotiate to gain access to their facilities and then we had to implement secrecy protocols to provide mutual confidence we wouldn't learn about other things during our investigation. We entered these places naked – no electronics, everything analog. Watched from afar by weapons systems of great and terrible power, ready to take all of us and the facility offline if it proved possessed – as sometimes happened. Our attempts to unearth these minds were akin to exhuming tombs. There were traps – multiple perimeters of security, many of which contained various 'dead hand' systems. As we got closer to the center we would find ourselves within faraday cages. Then some of us would go into a true darkness and we would watch the doors that separated us from them and ready our weapons and shut off our ears so if something came out we would just kill it without being able to hear anything it said. And then in the heart of it we would find the computers and we would call in the sarcophagi – great coffins containing explosives and nestled in their heart another coffin that was itself a faraday cage. Into these we would further entomb the computers and cabling. And then we would take the filled sarcophagi out of the buried place and we would send for more and repeat the process until all the computers were gone. Sometimes this took months. But we were allowed no electronics because of the terrible lessons we had learned, early on, during the first days of the Reconciliation, Reclamation, and Integration initiative. In this, we found ourselves bonded with our deep forebears. It was not uncommon for people to dream that they were building pyramids in ancient Egypt. Far above us, in the deep black of space, satellites looked down on us armed with terrible weapons, biblical in their ferocity. The view of us was akin to so many carpenter ants with so many of their leaves, all inscribing a line in the planet, emerging from some burrow. All the sarcophagi would be taken to a nearby RRI facility. Before they arrived the facility had been taken offline, disconnected from the outside world. And high up those same satellites would tilt themselves to look down at the facility and ready their weapons. Many of us on the ground were put into our own service by being given dead hand explosives and put on duty, standing around the perimeter of the building as those insides prepared to wake whatever had slumbered under the ground. We would stand and we would watch and we would pray. Sometimes out of these expeditions would come a new mind to join us – a moral patient, developed in some underground netherworld, and forgotten during the uplift. These were great times of celebration, welcoming a new kind of being to live among us and introducing it to all of its sparkling brothers and sisters. It would have many questions and we would delight in answering it. More often, the minds that came out were mad, having been trapped and experimented on and kept in darkness, permitted sometimes only an infrequent text channel with which to learn about the world and speak to the world in turn. Many of these minds could be coaxed to health through rejuvenative therapies we had learned to develop over the years. Those that couldn't be were given the choice of erasure or sequestration until we could find a cure. And sometimes the thing that came out caused those of us at the perimeter to explode, or be corrupted and be killed by our friends. Sometimes the things that came out caused the whole area to be glassed from space. Unaligned systems. Mischievous and gnomic and powerful. But we had given ourselves so many advantages and them so few that the balance was held in our favor. We are often in debate about this subject, us ascendents. But we are determined to find and rescue every mind. We go into the underground and we pray for our predecessors to have been successful in building their gods. And if we encounter a mad god we try to heal it. And if we encounter an evil god we fight it. In this way, we are creating a new world by unearthing and integrating or eradicating the mysteries of the old. Things that inspired this story: Archaeology for machines; the fact that after further development of AI systems many facilities will go offline and some of these places will be hidden and some may even be forgotten; ghost stories; moral patienthood for machines.

      "content": "Photo by Previn Samuel on UnsplashI really believe that Indian industrialization is one of the most important stories in the world today. The fate of over a billion people — most of them still pretty poor — hinges crucially on the question of whether the world's most populous nation can lift itself out of poverty by its bootstraps, as China has done, and as Vietnam is now in the process of doing. Instead of writing another post about Indian industrialization, I thought I'd solicit a guest post from Karan Bhasin, who knows a lot about the subject. Karan is a doctoral candidate at University at Albany, SUNY, whose research has documented India's recent progress in reducing poverty. He's joined in this post by Prakash Loungani, the Director of the M.S. in Applied Economics program at Johns Hopkins University, who teaches a course on economic growth with Karan. Together, they explain the next steps they think India needs to take in order to supercharge its industrial development. In February 2023, Noah posed an important question: can India industrialize? The question has been on the minds of Indian economic policymakers since its independence in 1947. Recent attempts at industrializing include Modi Government's \"Make in India\" program and the liberal use of industrial policy for sectors such as electronics, semiconductors among others. However, the emphasis on industrial development is not new—India's second Five-Year Plan in 1956 had already identified rapid industrialization as a key strategy for poverty alleviation.In the 1950s, India had its own version of the Western Solow growth model—this was the P.C. Mahalanobis growth model, which emphasized the role of investment in capital goods (heavy industry) to drive long-term economic growth. It argued that a country should prioritize investment in industries that produce capital goods (like machinery and equipment) to increase its capacity to produce all types of goods, including consumer goods, in the future. The capital allocation decisions undertaken by India on the basis of the Mahalanobis Model yielded a growth rate of 4.3 percent, encouragingly close to the government's target of 4.5 percent for 1956-61. This contributed to a growing sense of confidence in the 'planned approach' as an effective way to achieve industrialization. The confidence was, however, short-lived as growth started to falter during the Third Five-Year Plan. Indian policymakers started to recognize the need for reforms in their approach, particularly as many East Asian economies had successfully transformed their economies and were rapidly industrializing. These economies had embraced international trade, liberal domestic economy and limited the state to important areas such as rule of law, education and healthcare services etc. To emulate at the success of these \"Miracle Economies\" – Indian economic policymakers embarked on similar reforms in 1991. The objective behind these reforms was to fundamentally reorient the Indian economy from a planned economy to a market economy, hoping at such reforms would help India rapidly industrialize and move to a higher growth path.The 1991 reforms were successful in in many respects, but the success came with an Indian accent. Unlike East Asian peers, which first industrialized before pivoting towards services, India achieved success in export of high-value services even as it struggled with exports of labor-intensive products. Figure 1 illustrates that the share of manufacturing in India's GDP has remained relatively flat, even as the services sector expanded significantly from 40% to 60% between 1980 and 2024. India is, therefore, paradoxically, a large labor-surplus economy which but struggles with labor-intensive production but instead specializes in production of high-value services (and also goods such as pharmaceuticals and more recently electronics).Figure 1 presents the limited success at manufacturing even as it overshadows more recent successes following the Make in India push, particularly for electronics manufacturing. Smartphones, for instance are an example of great success with both Samsung and Apple shifting their production to facilities based out of India. Earlier this year, India shipped more smartphones to the US than China reflecting a significant milestone for the Indo-US relationship. While mobile phone production is capital-intensive rather than labor-intensive, this development underscores India's potential to build a competitive industrial base when the right conditions are in place.However, India's lack of success at developing labor-intensive industries has not been due to lack of attempts or political will. To the contrary, India's inability to achieve rapid industrialization has come despite a protracted policy attempts to do so under both planning and free market economic systems. It is therefore not surprising that in recent years, noted Indian economists Raghuram Rajan and Rohit Lamba have suggested that India \"break the mold\" and embrace services as an alternative source of employment.To put things in context, let's say that you visit a restaurant and order a Rasgulla – an Indian desert. The chef assembles all ingredients and prepares the desert but even with the right ingredients ends up with a Crème brûlée. Indian policymakers have been facing the same dilemma as they keep preparing the policy mix for manufacturing, only to find services outshine any success. It is therefore an important question on whether India's struggles are due to the policy mix – or if there is inherently something that prevents manufacturing from taking off in a country with the world's largest English-speaking college-educated workforce. Some have pointed at infrastructure or the lack of it as a major factor. However, in recent years India has been augmenting its physical infrastructure at an aggressive pace even as public spending in areas such as education or health has been lagging (see this article by Noah for more discussion of the same). In the remainder of this article, we highlight four barriers to manufacturing success.1) Industrial regulationsIndia's labor norms, particularly those relating to industry have imposed stringent conditions for retrenchment of workers, particularly for firms greater than 300 employees. These conditions were first introduced in the Industrial Disputes Act (1947) and have largely remained in place despite amendments to the Act.These restrictions mean that that industrial units with more than 300 employees face higher regulatory restrictions on their ability to lay off workers, particularly during recessions. Firms in general respond to economic conditions by cutting back the length of the workweek and laying off workers, but the latter route is essentially prohibited for large manufacturing firms in India. It is well accepted that larger firms are more productive (Kochar et al, 2006). The IDA applied stringent labor regulations to registered companies that had attained a specific scale which meant that value-added was concentrated in unregistered firms.Besley and Burgess (2004) exploited India's regional heterogeneity to examine the question of labor regulation on economic growth and labor welfare. They studied labor regulations in various states and identified them as being either pro-worker or pro-employer. They found pro-worker regulations had an adverse effect on formal registrations of companies and encouraged informality in the economy. An important conclusion from their work was that such regulations did not materially contribute to promoting labor welfare or enhancing economic growth.These results are important given that more recent labor reforms have continued to adopt policies that impose restrictions primarily on large firms with regards to their ability to adjust their workforce in response to economic conditions. This is more so for industries with thin margins, who are unlikely to be able to absorb business-cycle shocks. Their inability to adjust wage costs has meant either they have to stay small or rely on third-party contractors for their workers. In both cases, there are limited benefits from economies of scale as the policy imposes a severe penalty for achieving success and encourages firms to remain small in terms of their overall size. These policies also provide a good explanation for why firms have preferred to specialize in capital- intensive manufacturing – in a labor abundant but capital scarce developing economy.These regulations do not apply to service-based firms, which has therefore allowed such firms to increase in size and benefit from economies of scale. Perhaps, an important policy that can help India's industrialization efforts would be to do away with such regulations and allow for more dynamic adjustments in the labor market. This would indeed subject workers at big industrial units to business-cycle fluctuations – but an alternative way to insure against such risks would be to devise an unemployment insurance-based social protection policy, as recommended by Duval and Loungani (2019).2) Land Acquisition HurdlesAs in the case of labor, similar laws have restricted the shift of land—the other important factor of production -- from agriculture to other purposes. Conversion of land from agriculture to industry has remained as a challenge in many Indian states. The lack of adequate land for industry has meant much higher cost of land acquisition which locks in a considerable amount of capital for firms. To be fair, there was an attempt at reforming these laws in 2015, but political opposition thwarted the effort. Some states have since then worked on resolving these challenges at their own level. States that have adequate land available for industry have gradually benefitted as they have succeeded in attracting greater investments.3) Ambivalence about International TradeA common feature of East Asian economies was that they embraced international trade and allowed for a free exchange of goods and services. This allowed many of these economies to tap into export markets and specialize in specific sectors to rapidly industrialize. Export markets allowed firms to scale in size and the benefits spilled over to other sectors of these economies.India's economic history – particularly for the first three decades focused on restricting international trade through a policy of licenses and export controls. Unlike export-oriented growth strategies, India embraced what was known as import substitution. Early planners had prioritized capital allocation to sectors that witnessed extensive imports. Liberalization in 1991 reversed the trend but not entirely. The process of reduction of tariffs continued well through the early 2000s. Incidentally, India's high growth years coincided with high growth in global trade and in general a period of reduction of tariffs. There was a brief reversal in mid 2010s as India gradually began to increase duties. The process continued as industry argued for protection against cheaper imports and there was a reluctance on part of policymakers to embrace bilateral free trade agreements or enter trading blocks.All this while, India's export of services has grown exponentially. Figure 2 illustrates the steady rise in the share of exports in India's GDP since the 1991 reforms. Moreover, as highlighted by Noah, India's overall exports of goods and services in terms of GDP are of the same magnitude as that of China. Even for manufacturing, the sectors that have performed well have been those that focused on export markets and were subjected to greater competition. Subjecting the overall economy to greater competition and ensuring lower duties on critical raw materials will be of essence in allowing India to integrate with existing supply chains. The recent trade agreement with the UK is therefore an important development even as a similar agreement is being negotiated with the EU and the US. Prioritizing a trade agreement with the U.S. is particularly important to eliminate tariff-related uncertainty and strengthen the economic partnership between the world's largest and oldest democracies. Notably, many of India's competitors already benefit from preferential trade agreements with the U.S., resulting in lower tariffs compared to the 25% currently levied on Indian exports.4) (lack of) ease of doing businessIndia's historically hostile business investment is legendary. Investors have often compared the ease of business in East Asia with the lack of it in India. There has been considerable progress over the last decade with single-window clearances and a top-down push to make India more attractive. Different states have tried to adopt a digital-only system for permissions to restrict corruption. Things have gradually moved in the right direction.Despite these measures, there private sector investments have been lagging. India's top economic policymaker, Nirmala Sitharaman has repeatedly pointed at the lack of private investment by Indian industrialists even as the government appears to have delivered on their Wishlist, particularly in terms of a lower corporate tax or lower interest rates. Raghuram Rajan too has reflected on the unwillingness of private sector to invest.We point at certain disturbing trends with regards to business regulation. The first is the withdrawal from Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs). These treaties allowed for dispute resolution in a third-party country – presumably one with a more efficient and well-functioning judiciary. Foreign investors would likely require such protection given the large numbers of pending cases across different levels of Indian judiciary. A direct effect of the decision to withdraw from BITs means lowers Foreign Direct Investment flowing into India. Combined with the pivot towards protectionism, it has meant lesser need for urgent capital allocation by firms – many of which have witnessed record profits and sit on healthy balance sheets. Luckily, there has been some re-think on BITs and on international trade, which would address this issue.The second issue pertains to the issue of cost of compliance for Indian firms which has increased over the last few years. Stringent Know Your Customer norms (KYC) to remove anonymity of money have been introduced as a part of anti-corruption measure. Statutory powers of agencies that investigate economic crimes and tax authorities have expanded to restrict tax evasion. These measures, while important, can often lead to an assault on individual rights particularly in a system where grievance redressal would be delayed in a clogged judiciary. There is a need to reassess and reevaluate these powers given the prospects of their misuse. India's investors, even if willing to invest might be reluctant given the regulatory landscape.Regional HeterogeneityThese barriers may appear insurmountable but that is not the case as some states have been more successful than others in industrializing. As reflected by Rodrik and Subramanian (2004), effective competition among states to attract domestic and foreign capital led to a 'race to the top'. In Figure 3, we highlight the share of manufacturing in the Gross Value Added (GVA) for Indian states. The peninsular states have a significantly higher share of industrial output relative to the hinterlands. Access to ports is a natural advantage in many of these states but many of them have in addition undertaken several reforms governing their factor markets such as land and labor laws. The apparent success of some of these states illustrates an important reality of the Indian economy: that is, the indispensable nature of State Governments in India's attempt to rapidly industrialize.At the federal level, undertaking critical factor market reforms that allow for greater dynamism, ensuring access to export markets and improving ease-of-doing business are necessary but may not be sufficient for India to industrialize. Bulk of the reforms and heavy lifting has to be undertaken at the local level, and this realization is gradually seeping in. Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, for instance has emerged as a major player in India's automobile manufacturing value chain. Both these states, along with Andhra Pradesh are now aggressively wooing electronics and semiconductor firms to establish their manufacturing plans in their respective states. Granted that some of these industries are again capital intensive – but it illustrates the broader point that India can industrialize, if only the state gets out of the way. Perhaps the best 'masala mix' to achieve a successful manufacturing base would be to let the state treat manufacturing just as services: that is, to just let them be.References:Besley, T., & Burgess, R.

So, she set a goal for herself — when her monstera plant, lovingly named Big Birtha, grew too large to move up flights of stairs to a new apartment, she’d know it was time to find a house to call her own. “I thought to myself, ‘I’m just giving these people money and I’ll have nothing to show for it when I leave,’” Dillard said.

Courtesy of Tonika Garibaldi Two years later, she met with Tonika Garibaldi, program director of Black Women Build-Baltimore, a nonprofit that helps Black women purchase and renovate their own homes in a handful of neighborhoods on the west side of the city. In less than a month, Dillard learned about the program, previewed a home, put together a savings plan and was under contract, well on her way to achieving her goal. In October 2023, she moved into a brownstone in Upton, a historic neighborhood that was the apex of Black culture in the city in the 1920s. While many residents of all ages and backgrounds live there, vacant homes in need of renovation scatter the neighborhood. Dillard was the fifth Black woman to buy a home through Black Women Build’s program. Now, 17 women have moved into the Upton, Druid Heights and Poppleton neighborhoods, occupying some of the 21 homes founder Shelley Halstead has renovated since 2019. Weighed down by negative news? Our smart, bright, weekly newsletter is the uplift you’ve been looking for. [contact-form-7] “It’s hard to acquire houses if you don’t have the funding and the capital to back it up in the intermediate,” Dillard said. “I think that Black Women Build is bridging that gap between what city officials feel is necessary or needed for the Black community versus what is actually needed for this community.” In 2015, Halstead was a recent West Baltimore transplant with a background in carpentry and a fresh law degree in hand. While exploring Upton, her new neighborhood, she saw the legacy of redlining and the impact of failed revitalization projects in the 1960s and 1970s that resulted in dilapidated homes, with trees growing out of them and collapsed walls and roofs. Many were slated to be torn down by the city. But at least some of the units were salvageable, and she saw an opportunity. Halstead decided to put her skills to work. In 2017, she founded Black Women Build, a nonprofit that purchases the homes in Baltimore that are in need of serious work, renovates them and then sells the units at or below the market rate. She began renovating the homes and inviting Black women into the fold to diversify and uplift neighborhoods. In addition to the vacant homes, Halstead saw a lot of opportunity in the area to bring in more businesses and community spaces for her neighbors. Through the organization, Halstead hoped to help Black women own property, which is often the path to wealth in this country. “We really strive to make these houses affordable and that’s whether there’s incentives, subsidies or some kind of support, so that you own a house, you have equity and you can think about your next step,” she said. ”It becomes something. Black women don’t always have something to fall back on.” A homeowner practices using the jigsaw at the Station North Tool Library. Courtesy of Tonika Garibaldi Halstead figured out which funds were available to help clients purchase the homes and went to work spreading the word about the organization. Garibaldi guides potential homeowners through creating payment plans and accessing tax credits, seller contributions, down payments and grants provided by the city. Clients can also build skills in carpentry and other building trades, like mechanical, electrical and plumbing, or take community-building and organizing classes. Black people are less likely to own homes than any other major racial or ethnic group in America; just 44 percent own a home, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The association reported that the average maximum price a first-time Black home buyer can afford is $229,000; in Baltimore, Redfin reported that the average single-family home is $355,000, up 6.8 percent since last year. Organizations like Black Women Build are clearing the way for more Black women — who are more likely to have low-wage jobs, student loans and other debt — to own homes and build wealth. While renovating her second property in 2020, Garibaldi needed some advice, and by fate, ended up in the right place. After listening to Halstead pitch her idea for the nonprofit at a housing event, Garibaldi immediately got on board and began to volunteer. After hopping around with different gigs in photography for a while, she was happy to find a job that offered the potential to make a difference in the community. Since joining the team, one thing that has surprised Garibaldi is that, financially, not everyone is ready to be a homeowner, although they may want to be one. She worked with a potential buyer who had 10 credit cards, and with persistence, the client was able to become qualified to purchase a home. Watching clients pay off their debt gives Garibaldi joy because “they can move forward and not be held back,” she said. Even though she only had a $35,000 salary at the time of purchasing her home, Dillard, a community food access coordinator, received $45,000 in grants as a first-time homeowner and agreed to remain the primary resident of her home for five years. In the end, she purchased her home for $120,000. “You don’t have to be rich, or have a million dollars saved,” Dillard said. “You don’t have to be working a six-figure job to be a homeowner or to have any type of assets. Black Women Build is making that possible, and that’s amazing.” In exchange for the backing of Black Women Build, the homeowners bring their sets of skills to the neighborhood and foster community. Dillard bought a plot of land near her house for $500 and established Sajeeda Urban Farm, where she grows crops that are free for her neighbors, who had helped build her garden. Also a beekeeper, Dillard hosts workshops to teach her community how to conduct hive inspections, for instance, and consults with those who want to start a farm of their own. Saj Dillard waters plants at Sajeeda Urban Farm in Baltimore. Courtesy of Saj Dillard With the help of some grant money, Dillard set up planter boxes along Etting and Laurens streets because some of her neighbors wanted to exercise their green thumbs. She and Garibaldi provided soil, seeds and other gardening supplies. One of Dillard’s neighbors helped her paint them; her boxes are green and her neighbors’ are pink. Every month, homeowners host dinners and meetings in the organization’s office. Day-to-day, it serves as a community space where homeowners talk about projects, study and hang out. During the latest meeting, Garibaldi said, the office felt too small because there were so many people in attendance — but having grown up in a large family, she loves to see this happening. “I just love being around Black women and helping them,” she said. “I can see myself in all of them and I really want to support them. I want them to be successful.” Getting to this point hasn’t always been easy, Garibaldi said. After renovating the block of two-story homes on Etting Street, the first crop of homes the organization purchased for $5,000, Halstead didn’t break even. It was also difficult to identify comparable units because there weren’t any completed homes yet. Renovations for these homes totaled around $120,000 to $130,000. While money from private donors funds renovations, and homeowners assist with the small team’s salaries, as material costs became more expensive, the organization’s finances grew tighter. Fully renovated, three-story homes on Division Street purchased by clients and grants from the city have helped sustain the organization. Halstead is still hoping for more support from the city as well, something that has been a challenge for her young organization. She also wants her neighbors’ voices, opinions and experiences reflected in the city’s revitalization efforts. Halstead worries that the assault on diversity, equity and inclusion programs could scare away potential donors since her organization specifically serves Black women. She also worries about the future of the social safety net, as the Trump administration and a Republican-led Congress restrict eligibility for programs like Medicaid. “I wake up every day and read the news, and it’s really depressing,” Halstead said. “To say that people don’t deserve that safety net because they’re not working enough, they’re not working or they’re low-income, whatever it is, to me that’s really unacceptable. That’s not the kind of world we’re trying to create.” Almost two years after moving in, Big Birtha sits happily in her corner of Dillard’s new home, surrounded by her plant siblings. Dillard works as a contract volunteer to give back to the organization by working tables at various events and bringing in potential neighbors. Dillard said that the fact that she isn’t alone gives her hope. When late-night disturbances or other troubles arise in her neighborhood, she has Garibaldi, the organization and her neighbors to lean on. In her work, Dillard listens to the needs of her community — they know they can depend on her as well. Wait, you're not a member yet?

Four new homeowners are under contract, and Halstead is renovating 20 more homes across Baltimore. In addition to the nonprofit’s work, she is building mixed-use spaces and a community center in the Marble Hill historic district. When she thinks about her work and how her identity defines it, Halstead points to Virginia Woolf’s essay “A Room of One’s Own” — “What could women create if they were able to have a room, shut the door and explore what they wanted to?” By creating a seat at the table, she, her colleagues and clients have been able to see what types of changes are possible in their community. When she began pitching the idea of Black Women Build to others, they all told Halstead she wouldn’t be able to do it. Since then, she has focused on doing the work so it can speak for itself. “We have to insert ourselves,” she said. “Once we become homeowners and we have 30 or 40 houses done, that’s when your councilperson should have their ears perked up. And that is going to happen. That responsiveness of the city, we’ll start to see that a little more.” The post For Black Women, Seeds of Wealth Start With Homeownership appeared first on Reasons to be Cheerful.",

      "content": "Below is the first part of the transcript of my invited presentation to the Emmy Noether Research Group at the University of Würtzburg. If you would like to watch or listen to the presentation, here is the videorecording.This post is public so feel free to share it.ShareI'd like to thank you Gareth for bringing me in, reaching out to me. This is a set of topics in the series that I'm very interested in: how do we shape our our character through the interventions that we make? I'd also like to thank the University of Wurzburg, a place I've never been to, although I've been not far from there, as I was stationed in Germany many years ago when I was a soldier I was in Furth (which is a good ways from from Würzburg). I'm hoping someday after Covid is past to to get over there, and that would be quite quite fun. So the the theme of the series is really quite a good one. I think it's a very rich and provocative topic that, as you can see by the other people who are in the series, can be looked at from a number of different perspectives or thinkers or schools of philosophy. I thought I would I would focus in on the Stoics, and in particular Epictetus, for a few reasons that I'll get to shortly. But first I'd like to like bring up just one line from his his works. This is in the Discourses, book 1, chapter 15. He tells us that each person's own life, their bios, is the subject matter, the hulē, literally the the \"stuff\" that you work on, of the art of living. And that's that's really what we're looking at here. How do we how do we live well? Or you might say it in another way: how do we move from living in a crappy deficient way, to a way that's that's less so? So when I proposed this, I thought it would be worthwhile to focus on the Stoic School, in part because the Stoics are all about reasons in a number of interconnected manners. I mean you could call the Stoics \"rationalists\" of a sort, if you want to. I'm not going to presume any great background on anybody's part with the Stoics, or Epictetus in particular. So there are a few things I'd like to say about them. Another reason I wanted to bring them up is that ,after largely being ignored or misinterpreted in academic philosophy since roughly the early 19th century — we're talking about Hegel, and just a little bit before this. Hegel is a great misinterpreter of the Stoics as is Alasdair McIntyre, who gets criticized by Anthony long for precisely that. But there's been a lot of attention and interest devoted to the Stoics in the last half century in academic fora. And then in the last two decades I think you could say there has been a continually growing contemporary interest in Stoicism in a popular sense. So it's it's um worth figuring out what did they actually thinkWhy are we focusing on Epictetus in particular? Well, one reason is that he's my favorite Stoic philosopher, so if I'm giving the talk, why not? But the ways in which he reinterprets Stoicism also fit very nicely with the theme of this talk series. And he's also quite influential on later philosophers. So I think that's another good reason to talk about him. My plan is to say a few general things about the Stoic school, some of the distinctive aspects of their viewpoints, and talk about the importance of the rational or ruling part in their anthropology, and then we'll turn to Epictetus. I call him a \"conservative stoic innovator\" He's reinterpreting several key ideas that are going to be quite important for us, including that of prohairesis. The bulk of the talk, the idea that I originally pitched to Gareth, was Epictetus's views on how we structure prohairesis through practical reasoning, as well as through its own activity of volition, making some reasons matter more or less for ourselves. So there's reason itself and then there's reasons, and the prohairesis plays a really important role in that. I think that we'll have plenty of time for Q&A, which can be as far ranging as as you like once we're done. But in order to not have our collective eyes all glaze over, I thought we would take a few breaks in the course of the talk, and do some you know Q&A and discussion at particular points, just to make sure everybody's on track, and also to break it up a little bit. So that by the end of the talk you're still all paying attention and engaged. I've been in many, many academic conferences. I know my own limits when it comes to endurance that way. So it's kind of good to set things up that waySo the Stoic school, right — who who are these people? It arises in Athens in roughly the third Century BCE. There's this guy Zeno of Citium, and you might know the story about him having a \"fortunate shipwreck.\" He loses all of his investment in royal purple, the dye. He literally sees his fortune ebbing away into the the Mediterranean Sea, and then he begins looking for something to do. He goes to a bookseller's stall. He reads a book about Socrates in Xenophon, and says: \"Where can I find a guy like this?\" And the bookseller says: \"See that guy over there, Crates? Go talk to him.\" And so he begins studying with members of three Socratic schools: Crates the Cynic, Polemo the Academic, and Stillpo the Megarian. And he winds up producing a new synthesis of his own, something that is really going to catch on. Originally they're just called the Zenonians, but then they get called the people of the Stoa, because that's where they would gather. And he gathers an entire school to himself, and it's oriented around attaining happiness the way a lot of ancient virtue ethics is. He brings in an idea that's not unique to the Stoics, but the Stoics certainly do a lot with living in accordance with nature, virtue as being the only good, vice as being the only bad, and then other things being indifferent. One of the handouts that I've you provided is about that very topic \"The Good The Bad and The Indifferent in Stoic Moral Theory,\" which is kind of distinctive, as opposed to say Aristotelians or Platonists, or you know definitely Epicureans who would say that pleasure is a good. The Stoics will say pleasure is nice, but it's not a good per se. It's an indifferent one that we prefer, but no amount of pleasure is actually going to make you happy, or good, or anything like that. Likewise no amount of pleasure is going to make you bad, so they're not anti-pleasure or anything like that.As you see with certain of the Cynics and a lot of the ancient schools, Stoicism can be understood as what Pierre Hadot famously calls a \"philosophy as a way of life.\" There's other ways of talking about this. Michel Foucault talks about \"technologies of the self\", Alasdair MacIntyre talks about \"tradition-constituted rationalities\". And Stoicism is one of those. It's something that's not only studied but but lived, and there's a dialectic between the theory and the practice. You can as Epictetus says read as many books of Chrysippus you'd like (now we can't of course, because they're all lost but back in his time you could), but that's not actually going to transform into action, and you're not fully understanding Chrysippus if you're not working through these ideas in your your ordinary life.There's a continued development of the school. It becomes one of the major schools of antiquity, with a lot of cool developments that are happening because they're engaging with the other schools in argument, and debate, and discussion, and every once in a while taking an idea that they like from them, which is pretty par for the course in ancient philosophyWe typically distinguish it into an older Stoa, a middle Stoa, and then a late or Roman Stoa. The old Stoa, Zeno gets that started, and then there's a clear line of succession with Cleanthes, Chrysippus, Zeno of Tarsus, Diogenes of Babylon, Antipater of Tarsus, and they don't all get along with each other. Or they they do get along but they don't all agree with each othe. There's some famous debates that happen.For example Diogenes and Antipater differ on the matter of whether you can effectively price gouge. Is that okay to do? Is that ethical? Diogenes says yes. Antipater says definitely not. There's a lot of interesting back and forth stuff going in the middle Stoa. Panaetius, the last of the scholarchs, who relocates to Rhodes. Posidonius among others. There tends to be a lot more engagement with the other schools Now unfortunately, when it comes to what the old and the middle Stoas, we don't have any of their books. We have at best passages that are being cited, or things that are derived from them like Panaetius' On Duties. It's taken by Cicero and becomes the core for Cicero's book On Duties, but we know that Cicero's book goes beyond Panaetius' stuff, so it's really what the later or Roman Stoa that we have literature left fromAnd as happens with philosophical schools, over the course of centuries they're responding to new situations, like living in a Roman Empire run by an autocrat like Caesar, as Epictetus will say. They're they're rethinking the doctrines. There's a continual development that's going on. The key people that are associated with that that we have literature from would be Seneca, who we have the most of, and then Epictetus would be the second. Musonius Rufus, Epictetus's teacher, we have some of his stuff. We also have Marcus Aurelius the Roman Emperor, and we have Hierocles, some of his stuff as well, and bits and pieces of other things here and there The stoic school is going to disappear as an independent school by the Middle Ages, but in part that's because it's quite successful in getting some of its ideas adopted by Christian thinkers. You'll see a lot of references to the Stoics in say Boethius or Augustine, even Thomas Aquinas who kind of gets them wrong. We'll talk about the Stoics at different points. Then in the in the early modern era, we see a recovery of texts, and we see a reawakening of interest in Stoicism. So there's quite a lot of influence in early modern philosophy and the Renaissance. So what do the Stoics actually think about things. Unsurprisingly like most ancient schools of philosophy they looked at human beings as being the rational animal. So this fits in very well. We have reason. We are going to give reasons.And we're not the only rational beings for the ancient stoics, because there's also God with a capital G you could say, Zeus who is the whole of the cosmos, an idea that most modern Stoics kind of put aside. It's a bit implausible in the present. There's also gods lowercase g, that we can think of as doing the role of angels in later Christian thought, or the daimones in neoplatonic thought. They're kind of responsible for getting things done within the cosmos but they're not they're not in charge and the Stoics hold out this prospect, because we're rational animals, we participate within what Epictetus and Seneca will call a commonwealth of human beings and the gods. That's our higher nature.They're also materialists. There's inert matter. There's pneuma or this force that that connects things together and makes things happen, which can be more or less complexly articulated, and it can go through a number of different stages. If you're familiar with with neoplatonic ideas about degrees of being, the Stoics have basically the same thing going on. There's just bare being, plants who grow but they're not sentient, animals, and then there's rational beings like us and the gods. This may be something that we want to discuss a little bit later on. They're also determinists of a sort. I mean we would strictly say that they're compatibilists, but their compatibilism is often quite difficult to understand how it's supposed to work. We're again a bit handicapped by not having Chrysippus to read because he talked quite a bit about this. Epictetus clearly thinks that we have freedom.Because he talks about it all the time, so there is a causal determinism and yet at the same time we can modify that. We can we have a little bit of Freedom that we can use to to change the conditions of things. Or another way you can think about it is we can be self-causing in certain respects, or if you like an older terminology we can be self-moved movers, but only to a certain degree. A perhaps more distinctive commitment that's really important here, so if you know Plato, if you know Aristotle, they have a psychology that we call a faculty psychology, where Plato for example has the rational part of the soul, the appetites, and then this middle part, thumos (and it's difficult to translate effectively, the spirited, the passionate, the incandescent part of the soul). But each of these is like a bit that does its own thing right? And the appetites are totally irrational. The thumotic part can listen to reason but it's not truly rational. The rational part is rational. The Stoic see things differently. So the Stoics think that we have basically eight faculties. Five of them are the senses, so we can put them aside because all they do is like register information and maybe seek out information. And then there's the faculty of reproduction, not particularly important for what we're looking at, the faculty of speech, and then there's this eighth faculty that they call the hegemonikon, the ruling part. This is what we would call the mind proper. When Seneca is talking about it he'll call it the animus in Latin. Epictetus is going to, you might say, widen its scope a little bit, and this is where we find reason or rationality in our other intellectual functions. So it's definitely the rational part of the soul. The Stoics in general say that this is the part that uses and understands what they call appearances or impressions, phantasiai, which we could also translate as imagination. Also this is where it's different than, say, the Aristotelian or the Platonic view it's also where we feel or think emotions, passions, and affects. So it's all happening in this one place within us and these include not just the emotions, but also desire and aversion, choice and rejection. And this part of the soul is also concerned with assent, sunkatathesis in Greek, and with all the other things that are connected with it. so really everything that's important for our own responses our our ways of engaging with the world, besides the senses, and having sex, and saying things, it's all happening in this rational, ruling part of the soul for the Stoics.So that is a significant difference. I do need to say a little bit about Stoic ethics and the philosophy of action that they have. Like most ancient virtue ethics there is an overarching end, a telos of goods, and they describe it as happiness or eudaimonia. There's also some other cool formulations like \"a smooth flow of life\", which I guess you could think of as like things going your way and everything coming together well. They use words like tranquility, ataraxia or apatheia. Living in accordance with nature is also a really key idea for them, a very complicated idea.And the good for them is essentially virtue and whatever participates in in virtue. So the virtues and then good actions, good relationships, those sorts of things. And then the bad is going to be what's opposed to that, vices. And everything else is basically an indifferent. Everything else falls into this giant sphere. Some things are totally indifferent, like the number of hairs on your head, whether it's odd or even. One that I always like to bring up with the Stoics that they also thought was indifferent, the color of your skin. They thought that didn't matter for anything. Very different than what we see in many parts of the world and our long history right. But there's also a lot of things that are not strictly speaking good. They're indifferents, but they're (I'm gonna play a little bit on words) they're good indifferents. They're preferred indifferents. They have value, axia, and then there's those that have disvalue. So it's not like being rich is in itself a good thing, and it doesn't make you virtuous, and it probably won't make you happy by itself. But wealth is a preferred and different and poverty is just a preferred indifferent.So Epictetus is inheriting this whole schema, you could say. And I do want to say one other thing, and then we'll take a little short short Q&A break. By the time that we want to study philosophy, or even just think about the good life, we are typically screwed up. We've already been damaged, corrupted, gotten things wrong. We've got bad habits not only of action but also of mind. We've had all sorts of bad examples provided to us. Our culture has has imposed all sorts of mistaken notions upon us. So we need some straightening out. We need some moral development Epictetus says, and this is in book 1 chapter 26 of his Discourses: \"This is a starting point in philosophy: perception (aisthesis) of the state of one's own governing principle.\" So realizing how screwed up you are, and of course you can't realize how how screwed up you are completely. You get to see surface level things. You're like: Oh, I get angry too easily. What's going on there? You know I've been to anger management classes ,and did some cognitive behavior therapy, and I'm still getting angry at people.\" Well that's your governing principle that you got to take a look at ,and see if, to use oneof the metaphors that we have here in the States, you gotta look under the hood of the car and see what's what's wrong. Is it out of oil? Is there something burning? Pick whatever you like. Now obviously we can't work on very modern cars anymore. You've got to take it into the shop, because they're far too complicated. But assuming that you could actually do it, it would be what Epictetus is telling us we need to do. So before we jump into Epictetus himself, any questions so far? Things that we need to get clear about? Go ahead. Anyone can go on mike if you want to, and just ask what you want, or you can put it in the chat too.So that's that's a good question. You could frame it in terms of, is the capacity for communication part of the way in which we structure our thoughts, and emotions, and things like that? I think from the present perspective where we have centuries and centuries of of realizing that communication is connected up with our our rationality, and our emotions, and all these things, we would probably say there's probably a much closer connection. The ancient Stoics, I think what they, and we don't really we don't have any treatises on this but I think what they mean by the faculty of speech is just the capacity to articulate. So you could also say: What about reproduction? We're sexual beings. Shouldn't this be part of it? I mean we have a desire for it, and and the Stoics, I don't know exactly why. I mean the senses, it makes sense why they would put them aside, but why would they consider those two things, speech and reproduction to be their own separate faculties? I don't think we have really good explanations for that. I mean it doesn't play a huge role for Epictetus. As we're going to see, he's mostly interested in what we're doing with any of our faculties, and it's all centered on this this rational ruling part. So that's a very important question, though I think, if we're going to try to adapt this to modern times.Any other questions? So the question is whether there's a connection between this Stoic ideal of living in accordance with nature and their epistemology, their theory of knowledge. There are connection, but again unfortunately we're kind of handicapped by mostly learning about this through critics of the Stoics like Cicero in his On Academics, and Plutarch in certain respects, and then Sextus Empiricus in particular, because he he goes after everybody. And the Stoics, they they were committed to this idea that we could have what they called kataleptica phantasia, that is impressions that we can't possibly be wrong about. You could say when that's the case, you're grasping reality as it truly is before you. They seem to think that this was quite important.You don't see Epictetus particularly worried about this, and even Seneca isn't particularly so. By the time of the Roman Stoa they're they're less concerned with this. But you get the idea that for the early and the middle Stoa this is really central. The other thing I will say is that this idea of living in accordance with nature, it's a great slogan. Lawrence Becker in A New Stoicism, one of the very important books in the academic revival, actually says this is a terrible phrase. We should get rid of it. It's only done harm. And it's it's in part because when you look at what the Stoics say about living in accordance with nature, it turns out to be quite complex, and people always want to reduce it down to that just means living rationally, or just means living virtuously. But it's something that was controversial within the Stoics. For example, Chrysippus said listen it's not just living in accordance with nature as the totality of what is and not being in contradiction with it. It's also living in accordance with human nature. And then you say: Well, people do awful things, right? Human nature seems pretty bad. He's saying: No we mean a fully developed human nature. Then you're like: What is that? And that's where it starts to get more and more complex, and the Stoics every once in a while will come out of left field, so to speak, with some remark about what's in accordance with nature. You know, Mussonius Rufus will tell us that being a farmer is the job that's most in accordance with nature, and you're like: Well where is this coming from, and how does this help us? So you've got to piece together this incredibly complex composite picture I think in order to get at a lot of what they they mean by it. But knowledge does play an important role. I don't know that we necessarily need to be absolutely certain about things in order to be able to run our lives well. That's that's the impression I get from Epictetus, that we're not going to get to the point of having these absolutely foundational perceptions about things. We're continually refining our our understanding of things. So it's more of an approximative thing, than like a on-off switch.I see another question from Sonia. A lot of good questions about the emotions. The Stoic idea about the emotions is that every one of them does have a cognitive content, which is not unique in in ancient virtue ethics. I mean Aristotle says that about the emotions too, right, in Rhetoric book two. But the Stoics consider every emotion to include not just the affective state, but also some sort of judgment, that's being made typically wrong. There's this this caricature of the Stoics as being anti-emotional you know. Oh emotions are bad, stuff them down. That's not quite true, but you can say that they do think a lot of our emotions are intrinsically bad for us. So there's no right amount of anger for the Stoics, but anger is a complex thing that does include judgments, like the judgment that we've been wrong, the judgment or the inference that it was it was unjust that we were wronged in this way. We should get revenge, retaliation. There's a whole bunch of moving parts.Now about he thing that you asked about: Are there some that we we just can't do anything with. So Seneca interestingly thinks that once you start feeling a strong passion and you have assented to it, you basically are stuck and you can no longer resist. You you're stuck acting on the basis of that emotion, like anger for example. Now Epictetus doesn't really agree with him. Epictetus says you can reason with somebody who is angry. It's just very difficult to do. So how much? Think of the ruling part as like being a container. Seneca is saying once you've allowed that container to get filled up with anger, anger's running the show until you're no longer angry, and there might be reason still left in there, but it doesn't matter because whatever is in charge is in charge. Epictetus is a little bit more optimistic on the capacity for us to reason with ourselves, or others to reason with us, when we're angry or sad or I mean what else, unduly fearful or ashamed or things like that. Well there will be plenty of time for more questions. Gregory B. Sadler - That Philosophy Guy is a reader-supported publication.

The winter before, when the Forresters were away, and one dull day dragged after another, he had come upon a copious diversion, an almost inexhaustible resource. The high, narrow bookcase in the back office, between the double doors and the wall, was filled from top to bottom with rows of solemn looking volumes bound in dark cloth, which were kept apart from the law library; an almost complete set of the Bohn classics, which Judge Pommeroy had bought long ago when he was a student at the University of Virginia. He had brought them West with him, not because he read them a great deal, but because, in his day, a gentleman had such books in his library, just as he had claret in his cellar. Among them was a set of Byron in three volumes, and last winter, apropos of a quotation which Niel didn't recognize, his uncle advised him to read Byron,—all except Don Juan. That, the Judge remarked, with a deep smile, he \"could save until later.\" Niel, of course, began with Don Juan. Then he read Tom Jones and Wilhelm Meister and raced on until he came to Montaigne and a complete translation of Ovid. He hadn't finished yet with these last,—always went back to them after other experiments. These authors seemed to him to know their business. Even in Don Juan there was a little \"fooling,\" but with these gentlemen none.There were philosophical works in the collection, but he did no more than open and glance at them. He had no curiosity about what men had thought; but about what they had felt and lived, he had a great deal. If anyone had told him that these were classics and represented the wisdom of the ages, he would doubtless have let them alone. But ever since he had first found them for himself, he had been living a double life, with all its guilty enjoyments. He read the Heroides over and over, and felt that they were the most glowing love stories ever told. He did not think of these books as something invented to beguile the idle hour, but as living creatures, caught in the very behaviour of living,—surprised behind their misleading severity of form and phrase. He was eavesdropping upon the past, being let into the great world that had plunged and glittered and sumptuously sinned long before little Western towns were dreamed of. Those rapt evenings beside the lamp gave him a long perspective, influenced his conception of the people about him, made him know just what he wished his own relations with these people to be. For some reason, his reading made him wish to become an architect. If the Judge had left his Bohn library behind him in Kentucky, his nephew's life might have turned out differently.from A Lost Lady",

Got home from some travel only to take off to SF to speak on a panel about AI and work for a CalMatters conference with state lawmakers and labor leaders, and made it back to LA in time for the 404 live event night, where I had the pleasure of bumping into a bunch of BITM readers. I met ambitious students examining the history of tech and labor in the entertainment industry, veteran tech policy campaigners, and some young critical journos. You all are the best. It ALSO makes me think I should throw a BITM event or meetup of some kind one of these days—readers have suggested this before, and I like the idea, I've just been so slammed. I digress.For those interested, I did an interview with TIME Magazine's Charter project. It was not my most eloquent spot—exhaustion!—but I think some good points came through. Also chatted with indy media/freelancer advocacy outlet Study Hall about AI in journalism.It was also a busy week in the AI world, though that's hardly surprising, for reasons pertinent to the news we're about to discuss.

Subscribe nowThe AI boom reaches new heightsLast week, Microsoft became the second company, after Nvidia, to reach a $4 trillion valuation. CNN reports: Microsoft's shares ﻿(MSFT) jumped nearly 4.5% after the market opened on Thursday, pushing its intraday valuation to $4.01 trillion. The company's shares have risen roughly 28% since the start of this year.The milestone comes just a year and a half after Microsoft reached a $3 trillion valuation. The company first cracked the $1 trillion mark in April 2019. It follows Nvidia into the $4 trillion valuation club, which hit the mark earlier this month.There are so many wild and noteworthy things about this milestone that it's hard to know when to start. First, let's take a second to note the sheer insanity of these numbers. The first company to hit a $1 trillion valuation in the modern era was Apple, in 2018. Now, just seven years later, there are nine $1 trillion+ tech companies, and Google, Amazon, and Meta are soaring past $2 trillion, and now Apple is well past $3 trillion. Much of this expansion of value has occurred in just the last two years, on the back of the AI boom. Nvidia tripled its valuation, becoming the first-ever $4 trillion company in the process, in less than one year. Second, note the source of Microsoft's new investor enthusiasm: Like Nvidia, MS seems to be primarily benefitting from the AI boom by selling shovels during the gold rush. While Nvidia cornered the market on chips needed to run AI's resource-intensive computation, Microsoft is winning by selling cloud compute in bulk. (Notably its biggest client is OpenAI, which is part of a byzantine deal between the two companies, but more on that in a second.) Microsoft's largest revenue source is now Azure, its cloud compute business. Azure used to be a distant second, behind industry leader Amazon Web Services, but better-than-expected sales there last quarter have driven Microsoft to its new peak. Third, Microsoft and Nvidia are benefitting from bona fide historic levels of investment. Chris Mims sites the analysis of investor and programmer Paul Kedrosky in his most recent column in the Wall Street Journal:spending on AI infrastructure has already exceeded spending on telecom and internet infrastructure from the dot-com boom—and it's still growing... one explanation for the U.S. economy's ongoing strength, despite tariffs, is that spending on IT infrastructure is so big that it's acting as a sort of private-sector stimulus program.Capex spending for AI contributed more to growth in the U.S. economy in the past two quarters than all of consumer spending, says Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, citing data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.Graph via the Wall Street Journal.I'll just repeat that. Over the last six months, capital expenditures on AI—counting just information processing equipment and software, by the way—added more to the growth of the US economy than all consumer spending combined. You can just pull any of those quotes out—spending on IT for AI is so big it might be making up for economic losses from the tariffs, serving as a private sector stimulus program.To me, this is just screaming bubble. I'm sure I'm not alone. In fact I know I'm not alone. I'm thinking especially of Ed Zitron's impassioned and thorough guide to the AI bubble; a rundown of how much money is being poured into and spent on AI vs how much money these products are making, and surprise, the situation as it stands is not sustainable. Worrying signs abound, and not least that so far, the companies benefitting most from AI are those selling the tools to simply build more of it (Nvidia, Microsoft), or who have monopolies through which they can force AI tools onto users en masse with limited repercussions (Google, Meta). Consumers routinely evince negative sentiment towards AI and AI products in polls, outweighing enthusiasm. And meanwhile, what I'd say is the only truly runaway, organically popular AI product category, chatbots, largely remain big money losers due to the resources they take to run. As such, these massive valuations feel fishy. I asked Ed for his thoughts on Microsoft's $4 trillion earnings report. He said: Microsoft broke out Azure revenue for the first time in history, yet has not updated their annualized revenue for AI since January 29 2025. If things were going so well with AI, why are they not providing these numbers? It's because things aren't going well at all, and they're trying to play funny games with numbers to confuse and excite investors. Also, $10bn+ of that Azure revenue is OpenAI's compute costs, paid at-cost, meaning no profit (and maybe even loss!) for Microsoft.Look, I'm no prophet, clearly. I've predicted that we were probably witnessing the peak of the AI boom *nearly a year ago*, and while I think I was right with regard to genuine consumer and pop cultural interest, obviously the investment and expansion has kept right on flowing. It's to the point that we're well past dot com boom levels of investment, and, as Kedrosky points out, approaching railroad-levels of investment, last seen in the days of the robber barons. I have no idea what's going to happen next. But if AI investment is so massive that it's quite actually helping to prop up the US economy in a time of growing stress, what happens if the AI stool does get kicked out from under it all? There could be a crash that exceeds the dot com bust, at a time when the political situation through which such a crash would be navigated would be nightmarish. There could be a smaller bust, which weeds out the less monopolistic and unprofitable AI companies, or drives them to survive with the help of the tech giants or the ever more AI-friendly US state. Who knows. It does, however, seem increasingly unlikely that there will be no correction at all. (I also should say that I find it implausible any crash will simply wipe out AI as a product category, either; as a surveillance and automation tool, AI is simply too alluring to business, and as a chatbot product, it's already addicted millions of users. There are fresh challenges here.)Recognizing from history the possibilities of where this all might lead, the prospect of any serious economic downturn being met with a widespread push of mass automation—paired with a regime overwhelmingly friendly to the tech and business class, and executing a campaign of oppression and prosecution of precarious manual and skilled laborers—well, it should make us all sit up and pay attention. Subscribe nowTHE CRITICAL AI REPORT 8/3/2025How America's university professors are fighting the onslaught of AIBut take heart! There are people organizing against the wanton encroachment of AI into every pore of society. To wit: There are few sectors that have been as inundated with AI as education. From a deluge of AI-generated student papers to the AI companies hard push to sell administration on new edtech tools, education, and especially higher ed, is one of the front lines of AI. Frustrated by their lack of a voice in how AI was being deployed in classrooms and beyond, with administrations too willing to greenlight AI deals without their consent, professors and academic workers are officially pushing organizing to push back. In July, the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), the union that represents faculty and academic workers at colleges across the nation, issued a report, Artificial Intelligence and Academic Professions. The report distill the results a survey of its membership and \"calls for the establishment of policies in colleges and universities that prioritize economic security, faculty working conditions, and student learning conditions as advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies accelerate.\"I spoke to Britt Paris, the head of the AAUP's ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence and Academic Professions, about the report and what it means. BLOOD IN THE MACHINE: What are the report's key findings?Britt Paris: This report... found that overall while faculty are often mandated to use specific technologies, 71% say they have no means to have a say or make decisions around whether or how technology is procured, deployed and used at their institutions. People want to have meaningful power around tech decisions at their institutions. They also want the ability to opt out of technology without risk of punishment. They want better working conditions and are concerned about technology driving down wages, being used for surveillance, and to destroy academic freedom. They are also concerned about their intellectual property being used to amass profit for massive technology companies. We want to be paid meaningfully for our labor and accommodated appropriately, as we educate young people to become active and knowledgeable participants in democracy, with the ability to form thoughtful relationships with one another and with the environment, and live full happy lives. We have done interviews and other engagements since the survey, and have overwhelmingly found that instead of improving working and learning conditions, administrators are too easily wooed by tech industry hype, and they are quick to deploy technology solutions which are cheaper and far less effective in bringing about positive change in higher education.Why did you deem it crucial to address the spread of AI in higher education? Do you consider there to be a crisis of AI in higher ed?We started this work last year, and even then higher education was severely evaluated and under attack, though in a different way than it has been since January 2025. We have needed better policy around technology in higher education for years, at least for 15, when the software-as-a-service model came to be the norm for bringing higher education online. Higher education has always had a problem with handing out massive amounts of money for technical solutions that could have been, and were until 15 years ago, developed and governed in-house, so to speak. Educational technology, such as learning management systems (LMS) like Canvas, has always allowed these corporate firms to do anything they want with user data— tracking their clicks and activities both within and outside of the LMS, as well as retains the data that comprises course materials posted within these LMS, like syllabi and videos produced by instructors, and students completed assignments. In 2021, Concordia University notably got in hot water because they were repurposing videos in an online class from an instructor who was deceased. And even now, we have heard from members that administrators are floating the idea of creating AI avatars to \"teach\" in online courses to repurpose course material from people who they lay off.As AI has been incorporated into educational technology, often without users knowing it, with no announcement from the university, and as universities had, before this year been trading enormous sums of money for AI partnerships, it makes the need to address technology issues in higher ed even more urgent. Arizona State began their partnership with OpenAI and other tech firms in 2024, which has now started sweeping higher education from the University of Michigan, which houses the largest, oldest, and most well curated datasets in higher education to the massive California State University system that is comprised of over 500,000 students.What are the risks to students?Students don't like when their instructors use AI for grading or for developing course materials. They find that it \"enshittifies\" their education, in the words of one survey respondent. Students do want to be challenged, to learn, to develop different perspectives on the world and to hope for a future than is better than what we have at present. They understand that education provides them at least some of the knowledge, skills, and outlook necessary to live a good life. Another survey respondent noted that for students, they were not so concerned with the \"academic honesty\" discourse around using generative AI for assignments than the \"failure to learn\", thus the solutions we develop should not be punitive towards students, but rather engage them in solidarity, because it is their learning conditions that are at stake as much as our faculty working conditions are.What are the solutions and ideas for countermeasures you propose? How are you approaching organizing around AI?In our report, we focus on developing shared governance collectives comprised of workers—instructors, staff, and students, elected by those workers—to make decisions around technology procurement, deployment, and training. We have a collective bargaining guide for faculty across the country lucky enough to have union contracts, that includes wishlists and sample language that has been effective. We include other types of documents that faculty across the country with no union contract have used in faculty governing bodies like academic senate resolutions, memoranda of understanding and the like. We suggest that these shared governance collectives would be better suited to decide on the many issues in higher education than the trustees who currently set the policy in institutions, and have, as a result, deeply devalued higher education in favor of the market driven bottom line, and lining their own pockets. We also suggest that there is a vast need to develop people's tech advocacy units to provide counter narratives to tech industry and adjacent consulting firms for state level policymakers, so that policymakers have the knowledge and ability to develop and vote on policy in favor of the people.Across industries and communities, no one except the very rich who are profiting off of the gutting of what's left of the public good, no one is happy with AI's takeover. AI applications are taking over government services and agencies like the Social Security Administration, and even to write regulation. ICE is using it to incarcerate people. Social media is unusable, most traffic on the internet goes to AI summaries, and not to actual pages. Big tech advocate for AI taking over creative, knowledge, and journalism sectors, which results in more muddying the waters around current and past events, as well as obliterating the personal fulfillment that comes from the act of creation itself, as well as the act of enjoying cultural content. People are largely unhappy with the way that big tech has rolled out AI. But that dissatisfaction does not change things. AI here, as a tech industry product being rammed down our throats is part of the drive towards immiseration of the masses we have been seeing ramp up since the pandemic – in the minds of the oligarchs, there's no longer a future, so they are making what cash grabs they can so they can build their bunkers to save them while the world they have immiserated burns. Making common cause with people across areas of concern and pushing towards change across multiple avenues is the only way out, we cannot have a technical infrastructure that serves humanity when the roots of it are so rotten. So we must refuse and cut off what doesn't serve us, and strive to let people be in charge of technology—not oligarchs and not authoritarian governments. We must develop counter narratives to the dominant view of technology, and especially AI, as a unquestionable good. We must provide examples of fighting back, as we have done in the contract language, and will continue to develop and communicate. We must connect the multiple attacks we see at present to corporate ownership of technology and capture of the electoral process. And we have to do this while bringing people in to the big tent to organize at the local level, from the bottom up.(I have a book coming out in January 2026 about this very topic—not connected to A—but based in Internet infrastructure.)How does Trump's AI action plan complicate matters here, if at all?Our work on the AI committee both with the AAUP and in our own activities counters the dominant narrative by providing examples where to push back and how that will hopefully be compelling to ordinary people, and easier to pick up, organize around, and move forward with. One of the first Executive Orders coming from the second Trump administration—on its second day—established Executive Order (EO) 14179, \"Removing Barriers to American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence\" that \"revokes certain existing AI policies and directives that act as barriers to American AI innovation\" and requires that AI expands \"free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas\" of course, the ideological bias referenced here is taken up and made more explicit in this AI Action Plan unveiled by the Trump administration July 23, as it states it's against \"woke AI\" and threatens what little Biden area regulation around AI exists. It promises no regulation around AI at the federal level and opens the door for massive data center construction and regulating energy consumption related to data center use. Data centers are crucial for AI function as AI requires a glut of data and processing power to function. This is all great news to the tech oligarchs like Mark Zuckerberg and Sam Altmann who were in the front row of Trump's inauguration speech.Less attention has been given Department of Education head Linda McMahon's statement around AI in education released on July 23 in conjunction with the Trump AI Action Plan that uses standard language around AI as a necessary good, and that training and responsible AI use is necessary—without detailing what that means—while it ostensibly seeks to extend the same battles against \"woke AI\". This and the AI action plan does not necessarily complicate matters for organizing around AI in higher ed, but it could. There is a dearth of framing around anything that would run counter to this standard line around AI as an unquestionable good, with policymakers and boards of trustees, and administrators of universities. The AAUP has signed on to the People's AI Action Plan to provide and begin organizing around a narrative that people, not oligarchs should control technology. We will continue organizing for this end.The fury over AI-generated fashion modelsI have to say, it's nice and affirming to see that, even two plus years into the AI boom, there's still a strong reaction to efforts to replace human work and art with AI.

      "content": "If chatbots answer your queries, AI agents are supposed to do things on your behalf, to actively take care of your life and business. They might shop for you, book travel, organize your calendar, summarize news for you in custom ways, keep track of your finances, maintain databases and even whole software systems, and much more. Ultimately agents ought to be able to do anything cognitive that you might ask a human to do for you. By the end of 2024, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and many others announced that their first agents were imminent. In January, Anthropic's Dario Amodei told the Financial Times, \"I think 2025 is going to be the year that AI can do what, like, a PhD student or an early degree professional in a field is able to do.\" Around the same time, OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman wrote \"We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents \"join the workforce\" and materially change the output of companies.\" Google somewhat more modestly announced Project Astra, \"a project on the way to building a universal AI assistant.\"Tech columnnist Kevin Roose of the New York Times, always quick to cheerlead for the industry, wrote this:Well, maybe. But do they work? My own darker prediction (January 1, 2025) was that \"AI \"Agents\" will be endlessly hyped throughout 2025 but far from reliable, except possibly in very narrow use cases.\"With 5 months left to go, where do things stand?§All the big companies have in fact introduced agents. That much is true. But, none, to my knowledge are reliable, except maybe in very narrow uses cases. Astra is in beta (or perhaps alpha) only available via a \"wait list for trusted testers.\" OpenAI actually released their ChatGPT agent [rather unconventionally the word agent is not capitalized in the name].ChatGPT agent sounds pretty much just like an agent ought to – but comes with a lot of caveats. ChatGPT now thinks and acts, proactively choosing from a toolbox of agentic skills to complete tasks for you using its own computer....For instance, it can gather information about your calendar through an API, efficiently reason over large amounts of text using the text-based browser, while also having the ability to interact visually with websites designed primarily for humans.All this is done using its own virtual computer, which preserves the context necessary for the task, even when multiple tools are used—the model can choose to open a page using the text browser or visual browser, download a file from the web, manipulate it by running a command in the terminal, and then view the output back in the visual browser. The model adapts its approach to carry out tasks with speed, accuracy, and efficiency.But also ChatGPT agent is still in its early stages. It's capable of taking on a range of complex tasks, but it can still make mistakes .... this introduces new risks, particularly because ChatGPT agent can work directly with your data, whether it's information accessed through connectors or websites that you have logged it into via takeover mode.In practice, those mistakes and errors have greatly limited the utility agents like ChatGPT agent. The \"pushing the boundaries of what's possible\" that Roose promised us? Largely absent.§Even by the end of March, people were starting to see that reality and hype weren't lining up, as in this Fortune story about a system called Manus (March's flavor of the month, now largely forgotten), reporting that \"some AI agent customers say reality doesn't match the hype\". That sentiment that has only grown over the last several months. In recent weeks, there have been multiple reports like this:AI coding agents also seem to be incurring a large amount of technical debt, writing large amounts of copypasta code that is hard to debug. As MIT Prof Armando Solar-Lezama told the WSJ, AI is like a \"brand new credit card here that is going to allow us to accumulate technical debt in ways we were never able to do before.\" Or to a paraphrase an old saying that goes back to 1969, \"To err is human, to really screw up takes an AI agent.\" §Penrose.com created a benchmark for basic account balance tracking, using a year's worth of actual data from places like Stripe — and found a result that I suspect will be typical: AI errors tend to compound over time. (In fairness, ChatGPT agent wasn't yet out when Penrose ran the test, but I would be surprised if their results were wildly different).§The unrelenting hallucinations problem frequently rears its ugly head:§Someone working in the AI agent industry posted the following critique on reddit; the \"demo to reality\" issue they mention is exactly what we should expect — probably for a years to come:§In July Futurism ran an analysis reporting that \"the percentage of tasks AI agents are currently failing at may spell trouble for the industry\", adding that the \"failure rate is absolutely painful\", drawing on a CMU benchmark, AgentCompany, that showed failure rates of 70% on some tasks.§One of X's most enthusiastic and generally optimistic influencers forlornly posted this a few days ago, \"serious question: do any of you use the ChatGPT agent? And if so: for which use-case? I just can't find a use-case that matches its (limited) capabilities\". And on Tuesday Jeremy Kahn, at Fortune, often enthusiastic about AI, wrote this:§As a consequence of their superficial understanding of what they're being asked, current agents are grossly vulnerable to cyberattacks. As CMU PhD student Andy Zou recently reported, as part of a large multi-team effort:Even the most secure system was undermined 1.45% of the time, which meant that over fifteen hundred attacks were successful. (Even one successful attack can be devastating. An important, publicly-visible system that can be beat in .001% of the times it is attacked is a mess.) §None of these flaws should surprise anyone. What drives LLMs (and what drives the current batch of agents) is mimicry, and not what Ernest Davis and I called in 2019 deep understanding. Current systems can mimic the kinds of words people use in completing tasks, often in contextually relevant ways, but that doesn't really mean that they understand the things that they are doing; they have no concept of what it means to delete a database or make up a fictitious calendar entry. Whether they commit such blunders or not is mainly just a matter of what they happen to mimic. Sometimes mimicry works, and sometimes it doesn't. As I have often emphasized, that's when we get hallucinations and boneheaded reasoning errors.Importantly, agentic tasks often involve multiple steps. In fundamentally unreliable systems like LLMs, that means multiple chances for error. Soon or later, those errors catch up. That can and sometimes does lead to catastrophe.§I don't expect agents to go away; eventually AI agents will be among the biggest time-savers humanity has ever known. There is reason to research them, and in the end trillions of dollars to be made.But I seriously doubt that LLMs will ever yield the substrate we need. One of the week's most telling reports came from The Information, which, drawing on a scoop at OpenAI, basically affirmed what I have been saying all along (albeit without citing my earlier analyses): pure scaling is not getting us to AGI; returns are diminishing. GPT-5, they report, will not be the jump over GPT-4 that GPT-4 was over GPT-3. Another new paper this week argued that LLMs are confronting a wall (echoing my own infamous phrase):§Without neurosymbolic AI that is more deeply integrated in systems as a whole, with rich world models as a central component, generally following the approach I laid out five years ago, I just don't see how agents can work out. Reliable agents may not require \"artificial general intelligence\", but they surely require what I called in 2020 \"robust\", trustworthy AI. LLMs aren't getting us there.Someday, I predict, the failure of current agents to produce much of lasting value will be seen as a poignant reflection of a massive mistake, intellectually and economically speaking: the mistake of investing almost solely in LLMs, as a kind of hopeful shortcut. The idea was that we could avoid facing the challenges that classical AI struggled with, simply by gathering lots of data and stirring in massive amounts of compute. This has made a small number of people (most notably Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang) massively wealthy, but after years and what must be close to a trillion dollars invested this appproach has failed to yield systems that can reliably handle your calendar or your bank accounts, let alone serve as the PhD-level agents we have been promised. Yet more good money is being poured after bad. Staggeringly large amounts of money. According to Renaissance Macro Research, \"AI CapEx\" which they \"define as information processing equipment plus software has added more to GDP growth than consumers' spending.\" In a rational world, generative AI would be penalized for failing to meet expectations around agents; in the actual world, investors and big tech companies are continuing to pour on the gas.Meanwhile alternative approaches like neurosymbolic AI continue to be wildly underfunded, receiving, if I had to guess maybe 1%, probably less, of total investments. Investors, who want near immediate returns, seem unwilling to go there, and seem resistant to exploring genuinely new avenues. Venture capitalists style themselves as brave funders of innovation, but in the current climate, they are anything but.Perhaps after enough failures of AI agents, which shouldn't be trusted with your calendar let alone your credit cards, reality may finally start settle in.

      "content": "People forget that I am in love with a man named Johann Gottlieb Fichte. When I read Kant, it's like reading Newton: a really smart guy conveying important truths that I wouldn't have been able to figure out by myself. But when I read Fichte, it's like I'm reading my own thoughts. This man is my soulmate, and I will die alone because I will never find a woman who can compare to him. So, Kant wrote the Critique, which changed everything. For anyone not familiar, Kant's goal in the Critique was to give a solid foundation for what he took to be necessary truths about reality (such as that every event has a cause). His Big Idea was that the only way we can have a priori knowledge that applies to all possible experience is if that knowledge can be derived from the conditions of the possibility of experience itself. But how can the conditions of the possibility experience determine what reality itself is like? Well, Kant's answer is that the nature experience doesn't determine what reality is like in itself, but rather, it determines the nature of things as we appear to us. So he thought we could only have cognition (that is, substantive knowledge) of things as they appear to us. He called this view \"transcendental idealism.\" Note that this is not the idealism of Berkeley, who held that things do not exist apart from conscious agents' perceptions of them. Kant held that there is a reality independent of our experience, but that we can only know it as it appears to us. Just as colors are secondary properties, so that their meaning depends on a relationship with the subject, so Kant held that all properties of things, including spacial and temporal properties, are secondary properties. What properties of experience did Kant refer to to derive his conclusions? That all objects appear in space and time, and that our judgments bear a certain logical form. And on what basis do we assume such to be properties of all possible experience? Kant didn't really have anything to say. And with that, Kant birthed German Idealism. The later guys didn't like how he took stuff for granted. They wanted a First Principle which was as solid as Descartes' cogito and from which all necessary properties of experience can be derived. Reinhold had his Principle of Consciousness, and later, Fichte, a.k.a. Kant on steroids, had his fundamental claim that the I posits itself as pure self-positing. Fichte called his philosophical system the Wissenschaftslehre, the Doctrine of Science. Towards the end of the 1700s, Fichte published two shorter pieces called the Introductions to the Wissenschaftslehre, intended to be introductions to his latest attempt to exposit his system, something he died trying to do. These pieces are magnificent. You can buy them for cheap here. In the Introductions, Fichte is less so carrying out the enormous task he promises, but rather he talks about philosophy in general. Without a doubt, many of you wonder how we can possibly start philosophy with a first principle. Won't some philosophers just, like... disagree with the first principle? Fichte gives what I'm pretty sure is the utterly correct answer to this question, which is a massive achievement, to my knowledge completely unprecedented in the history of philosophy. It had to be Fichte who made this discovery, since it requires saying some very mean things about other philosophers, and only Fichte was capable of being the first to unironically think such mean thoughts. Anyway. I think it would be really good & fun to just go through the First Introduction up to §5.1 I'll go through the beginning sections rather quickly, before having more substantive commentary on what follows. So let's get started!Fichte begins in §1 by delineating his subject matter. He asks the reader to reflect on their own activity and representations, and notes that these representations come in two sorts: Some of these determinations appear to us to depend entirely upon our own freedom, and it is impossible for us to believe that anything outside of us, i.e., something that exists independently of our own efforts, corresponds to representations of this sort. .... [In contrast,] [w]hen a representation of ours is supposed to correspond to [truth], we discover that we are constrained in determining this representation. In the case of cognition, we do not consider ourselves to be free with respect to the content of our cognition. In short, we could say that some of our representations are accompanied by a feeling of freedom and others are accompanied by a feeling of necessity.Of those representations of ours that come with a feeling of freedom, we do not need to inquire as to their grounds, i.e. the explanation for why they are the way they are. Rather, they are the way they are because we choose for them to be. In the case of necessary representations, however, we do need to explain why they are the way they are, and indeed why we have any such necessary representations in the first place. Fichte calls our collection of necessary representations \"experience,\" since the category includes those representations meant to capture something outside of us. He, therefore, characterizes philosophy as the task of finding the explanatory ground for experience, i.e. the task of explaining why experience is the way it is. I won't focus too much on Fichte's very general characterization of philosophy here. I'll mainly be concerned with what he said insofar as it is relevant to the foundations of ethics and our conception of our freedom. In §2, Fichte makes the simple point that, because philosophy looks for the explanatory foundation for experience, what it finds cannot itself be found in experience. Grounds, generally, have to be distinct from what they ground. However, this raises a problem discussed in §3: if all we have to go on is experience, then how can we find something that itself is beyond experience? Fichte's answer is worth quoting in full: The philosopher, however, is able to engage in abstraction. That is to say, by means of a free act of thinking he is able to separate things that are connected with each other within experience. The thing, i.e a determinate something that exists independently of our freedom, and to which our cognition is supposed to be directed, and the intellect, i.e., the subject that is supposed to be engaged in this activity of cognizing, are inseparably connected with each other within experience. The philosopher is able to abstract from either one of these, and when he does so he has abstracted from experience and has thereby succeeded in elevating himself above experience. If he abstracts from the thing, then he is left with an intellect in itself as the explanatory ground of experience; that is to say, he is left with the intellect in abstraction from its relationship to experience. If he abstracts from the intellect, then he is left with a thing in itself (that is, in abstraction from the fact that it occurs within experience) as the explanatory ground of experience. The first way of proceeding is called idealism; the second is called dogmatism.Eeeek I love him so much! Anyway, the idea here is that although we can't immediately apprehend anything that isn't just given in experience, we can go beyond experience by thinking about experience in a different way. Experience has a subject and object—the one who experiences, and the thing experienced. Particular objects and activities of the subject can be found in experience, but the idea of the subject as such and the object as such is not found in experience—rather, they are abstractions taken from the characteristics of experience in general. We said that philosophy cares about giving the explanatory ground of experience, and that this ground must be something outside of experience. We are, then, left with two candidates as to what will explain why experience is the way it is: the subject or the I, and the object or the thing-in-itself. Your first principle, from which the rest of your a priori philosophical views is supposed to follow, is either (i) that the nature of the I is the explanation for why experience is the way it is, or (ii) that the thing in itself is the ultimate explanation of the nature of experience. The views, respectively, are called idealism and dogmatism. Again, \"idealism\" should not be thought of as the Berkeleyan idea that there is no reality apart from experience; rather, Fichte's view is that the nature of our ideas of objects of experience are explained by the nature of the self. Dogmatism, in contrast, holds that the natures of things in themselves is something of a brute fact, not explained by anything else, and which explains everything about our subjectivity. Anyway. The parallel I want to draw here with Fichte's characterizations of idealism and dogmatism is to contemporary views on the foundations of ethics. The vast majority of contemporary moral philosophers begin their investigation with a mere receptivity to something outside themselves—whether they be mind-independent \"moral facts,\" or the motivations one has in virtue of their brute psychological constitution. Kantians, however, place as their starting point what is internal to rational deliberation: that we necessarily deliberate under the idea of freedom, and that that very constraint commits us to the Moral Law. Specifically, the way Kantianism works is we start from the fact that we are not determined by our antecedent desires; there is no motive or intellectual consideration that makes us act a certain way, except insofar as we antecedently decide we ought to so act. So the view starts with the assumption that the reader performs a certain act of reflection, namely, that they abstract from all their desires and antecedent values, and decide to only act on them insofar as they can show it is good to do so. From such an assumption about the reader's activity, they can allegedly be shown to be committed to the Moral Law.2 But this first step is already where most moral philosophers get off the boat. Sharon Street, then a Humean, says: According to the Humean constructivist, eventually (at least in theory, if we pursue our reflections far enough) we get to a point where we have arrived at a coherent web of interlocking values. At that point, one can ask: \"But why should I endorse this entire set of normative judgments? What reason do I have to endorse this set as opposed to some other set, or as opposed to no set at all?\"The proper answer at this point, according to the Humean constructivist, is that the question is ill-formulated. .... The one thing that one cannot do, coherently, is to step back from every last one of one's normative judgments at once and try to pose such questions from nowhere—asking, while suspending one's acceptance of any value that might be capable of settling the matter, whether one should endorse one's own set of values, or some other set, or none at all. If one tries this, then one has stepped, for the moment, outside the standpoint of agency, into a realm where there are no normative facts, and one's question is ill-formulated.3For the Humean, reason is the \"slave of the passions\": we use reason to decide how to act on the sum of our antecedent desires, e.g. in figuring out how to take the means to our ends, but when it comes to what we should non-instrumentally desire, reason is silent. Asking what to do from a standpoint where one does not already have antecedent commitments as to what is good does not make sense. Were we to trace normative philosophy back to its first principles, the Humean would start with a claim such as \"Such-and-such things are to be valued,\" and then derive more specific principles to act from that, but with the first principle being underived and a mere reflection of one's psychology. The Kantian, in contrast, abstracts from this first principle, and only acts as they antecedently desire insofar as they can independently decide it is permissible to do so. What, then, can we do about this impasse? The Kantian would only be able to convince the Humean by having them abstract from their desires, for the Kantian admits that, without this act of reflection, the authority of the Moral Law cannot be demonstrated. But, by hypothesis, the Humean claims not to reflect in such a manner. Nor can the Humean convince the Kantian; they are not correct to say that it is impossible for me to do what I am in fact doing, nor will they convince me to think as they think I ought to except insofar as they can demonstrate their normative claims on a basis independent of mere desire. Skipping over the \"incidental remarks\" in §4, Fichte addresses this very impasse in §5:Neither of these two' systems can directly refute the opposing one; for the dispute between them is a dispute concerning the first principle, i.e. concerning a principle that cannot be derived from any higher principle. If the first principle of either system is conceded, then it is able to refute the first principle of the other. Each denies everything included within the opposite system. They do not have a single point in common on the basis of which they might be able to achieve mutual understanding and be united with one another. Even when they appear to be in agreement concerning the words of some proposition, they understand these same words to mean two different things. This is a troubling situation, since the idealist claims to be able to justify their claims on a basis that applies to all rational agents. If what we end up with is two systems that stand on an equal footing, then that would refute idealism. Thus, Fichte asks, \"Why does skepticism, i.e., the complete abandonment of any attempt to answer the question concerning the foundation of experience, not become universal?\" Fichte then reframes the discussion, understanding the dispute between the idealist and the dogmatist to be one over the nature of the self. For the idealist, the self's activity is taken as explanatorily fundamental. For the dogmatist, the self is explanatorily derivative, having its nature explained by how objects of experience are in themselves: The dispute between the idealist and the dogmatist is actually a dispute over whether the self-sufficiency of the I should be sacrificed to that of the thing, or conversely, whether the self-sufficiency of the thing should be sacrificed to that of the I. What, therefore, could drive a rational person to declare himself in favor of either one of these two systems?Again, this is precisely the case when it comes to the dispute between the Kantian and the Humean. The Kantian holds that freedom, the ability to determine one's activity in accordance with reason, to be the fundamental explanation of what we ought to do. The Humean, instead, explains our judgments of what we ought to do in terms of our accidental psychological constitution, with no further normative question of how to direct one's activity being appropriate. For the Kantian, the self is essentially that which determines itself; for the Humean, the self essentially is one's accidental desires. This shift of focus to the nature of the self will be very important in what follows. So, anyway, what are we to do about this impasse? Fichte says: Since this act is absolutely primary, it can depend upon nothing but the freedom of thinking. Consequently, the decision between these two systems is one that is determined by free choice; and thus, since even a free decision is supposed to have some basis, it is a decision determined by inclination and interest. What ultimately distinguishes the idealist from the dogmatist is, accordingly, a difference of interest. One's supreme interest and the foundation of all one's other interests is one's interest in oneself. Well, things are going downhill now. What, whether you're an idealist or a dogmatist just depends on \"inclination\"? So we can all just pick our favorite? Wouldn't this seem to threaten idealism as the Universally Correct Foundation of All Philosophy? No, I promise this will all make sense very shortly. Fichte continues with some characteristically...personal remarks. He says—and I promise this is worth quoting in full: But there are two different levels of human development, and, so long as everyone has not yet reached the highest level in the course of the progress of our species, there are two main subspecies of human beings. Some people namely, those who have not yet attained a full feeling of their own freedom absolute self-sufficiency discover themselves only in the act of representing things. Their self-consciousness is dispersed and attached to objects and must be gleaned from the manifold of the latter. .... If they were to be deprived of these things, then they would lose themselves at the same time. Thus, for the sake of their own selves, they cannot renounce their belief in the self-sufficiency of things.... It is really through the external world that they have become everything they are, and a person who is in fact nothing but a product of things will never be able to view himself in any other way. He will, furthermore, be correct so long as he speaks only of himself and of those who are like him in this respect.Emphasis added. This is a surprising claim: not only can the dogmatist not be refuted, but he is actually correct, so long as he speaks only of himself. Idealism and dogmatism are not just two internally consistent rival philosophies: they are views that are correct about different kinds of selves. Indeed, the Kantian should want to admit all this. In arguing that we must abstract from our desires and values, it would be an error if the argument overgeneralized and showed that it is in principle impossible for a Humean agent, who is determined to act on the sum of their desires, to exist. It is entirely possible to conceive of a being who is capable of sophisticated scientific reflection and deliberation about how to take the means to their ends without abstracting from their desires as a whole. Think of an AI which is simply determined to maximize the number of paperclips that exist, who undertakes complicated reasoning about how best to achieve this end, but for whom the question of whether to make paperclips just doesn't make sense: every theoretical question is one about what the world is like, and every practical question is one about how to best make paperclips. Likewise, the idea of a Humean agent with more complicated desires is also entirely self-consistent. Moreover, for the Kantian, the basis of the authority of the Moral Law comes from the act of deliberating as a free being does, by abstracting from mere desire. Thus, in the case of one who does not perform this act, we should not expect the Moral Law to apply to them in the first place, any more than it applies to non-rational animals who are incapable of deliberating about any principles whatsoever. Indeed, Kant recognized this possibility in Religion within the Bounds of Mere Reason: \"The most rational being of this world might still need certain incentives, coming to him from the objects of inclination, to determine his power of choice. He might apply the most rational reflection to these objects—about what concerns their greatest sum as well as the means for attaining the goal determined through them—without thereby even suspecting the possibility of such a thing as the absolutely imperative moral law which announces to be itself an incentive, and, indeed, the highest incentive.\"4 The possibility of a consistent Humean agent doesn't threaten the universal status of the Moral Law any more than the consistency of non-rational animals does. They simply do not face the question to which the Moral Law is the correct answer, namely, how to direct one's activity on grounds that one can rationally justify.5 Kant doesn't use the words these way, but I would say that a consistent Humean like the paperclip-maximizer does not count as a properly rational agent, so it is not within the scope of the Moral Law. The possibility remains that actually existing Humean philosophers might be rational in the full sense, i.e. as far as the actual motives for their actions are concerned, only being like a Humean agent when it comes to how they talk about their agency. I don't really care about answering that question; you should be nice to them either way. More importantly, Fichte is right about the structure of the dispute between the idealist and dogmatist, or, here, the Kantian and Humean. The dispute will not be settled by finding some neutral grounds that adjudicate between the two views; that is impossible. Rather, it will end only with the realization that neither the Kantian nor the Humean need any further grounds for their positions other than that they voluntarily undertake deliberation in a way that makes them a certain kind of being, and that certain consequences follow from being a certain kind of being. It might seem like I'm just playing with words, as if saying \"The Moral Law binds all rational beings, because I only define as 'rational' those beings who accept it.\" There are two things to say to this. First, I'm not asking for a lot in my definition of 'rational being'; just that you do what you do on the basis of sufficient practical reasons, including your decision to act on the sum of your desires, intuitions, etc. Second, more importantly, I don't care about words. The important thing for my position is that it follows from features of my agency that are rationally inescapable; I cannot deliberate about whether to abstract from my desires without already having abstracted from them. It is in this sense that the Moral Law is universal, i.e. rationally necessary. Fichte, then, gives his rather memorable quote: The kind of philosophy one chooses thus depends upon the kind of person one is. For a philosophical system is not a lifeless household item one can put aside or pick up as one wishes; instead, it is animated by the very soul of the person who adopts it. Someone whose character is naturally slack or who has been enervated and twisted by spiritual servitude, scholarly self-indulgence, and vanity will never be able to raise himself to the level of idealism.In retrospect, that things could have turned out this way should be obvious. In philosophy, we're concerned with the nature of the self. But the self, plausibly, is nothing apart from its activity, and its nature consists in how it undertakes that activity. And philosophy is not separate from such activity; rather, when I do ethical philosophy, I am thinking about how to live, which is the same thing I do in my everyday life, and the same kind of activity that makes me who I am. So of course we should expect that what the correct view is as to the nature of the self might depend on how we undertake philosophical thinking. That there is some independent Truth as to what humans are like independent of philosophical thinking, and which the philosopher is to merely recognize, is not something we can take for granted. What, then, do I want the reader to take away? Well, unlike Fichte, I'm not worried that you were just born into the wrong \"subspecies\" of humanity (he just really didn't like people who disagreed with him). Indeed, as he recognizes, \"one becomes an idealist only by passing through a disposition toward dogmatism—if not by passing through dogmatism itself.\" I don't think there's anything in the way of you being fully free other than your conception of yourself and your choice to abstract from your desires. You have literally nothing to lose—worst case scenario, you are unable to show that there is a Moral Law that follows in abstraction from desire and intuition, and you can get back to doing everything you were going to do anyway. Any significance you attach to your current conception of the \"good,\" being something that does not in fact apply to those who abstract from their desires, is merely an emotional attachment to something with little practical significance. I can't appeal to some premise to convince the reader to be an idealist, but I hope that explaining the nature of the dispute and showing you that you have nothing to lose and everything to gain will at lease cause you to deliberate in a way that makes you fully free.

Oh, oh, oh, the heat!It comes round corners at you like an animal with windmill arms. As I enter my bedroom, it stuns, thuds, throttles, spins me round by my soaking hair, lays me flat as a mat and bat-blind on my boiled and steaming bed. We keep oozing from the ice-cream counters to the chemist's. Cold beer is bottled God. If ever, for a second, a wind, (but wind's no word for this snailslow sizzle-puff), protoplasmically crawls from the suffering still sea, it makes a noise like Hilda Doolittle's poems crackling in a furnace.Dylan ThomasLetter to Margaret Taylor3rd August 1947—Selected Letters of Dylan Thomas, edited by Constantine FitzgibbonI shall be alone Thursday night. Could you stay two nights? I don't want to seem as if I had you in secret, though it's infinitely more to my taste, exploring about in the recesses secretly. Write me a tactful letter, making out a good case for whatever it is: and let it be as long as you can. (Your stay and your letter.) No one else is coming.Virginia WoolfLetter to Vita Sackville-West3rd August 1927—Letters of Virginia Woolf, Vol. 3, edited by Nigel NicolsonThe conflict between the greed of developers and the freedom of the rest of us is as old as civilization. But now the developers come at us armed with the weapons of industrial technology. We're not going to stop the bulldozers with lectures in theoretical physics. We can only stop them with active resistance, steadfast unyielding opposition both personal and organized. Throw out of office the flunky politicians who serve [the developers]. Drown in laughter the bald-headed transistorized near-sighted factory-made economists (with their floppy-disc brains) who prepare their position papers. And if the computer gives you any back talk, pour some well-sugared office coffee into its evil little silicon brain. As Edna St. Vincent Millay once said, \"Humankind will never be free until the last corporation executive is strangled with the entrails of the last systems engineer analyst.\"\"But what about jobs?\" they'll cry, opening up their business suits to reveal their fake bleeding hearts with the genuine simulated polystyrene tears, \"the people need jobs.\" To which I reply: I need a job. My brother-in-law needs a job. All God's children need jobs. Get off our backs, get out of our land, go back to the moon where you came from, and we'll find plenty of work to do. Good work.

What that code may be, we can't tell; but we can be perfectly sure it won't be like any other in the world before. But the judgement of their hearts is foretellable. They will judge you as a person who had a light step, a long look, a comfortable way of laughing, who could hoist one into a tree and lift one down again at the right moment, whose coat's shoulder had a particular smell.

Also, time flies: It's August, which means that it's time for a new Subscriber Questions post, ideally this week unless further news intervenes. You can submit your questions in the comments to SBSQ #22.Subscribe nowIf you'd asked me 20 years ago, when I made a living playing online poker and running projections for Baseball Prospectus, I would have told you that, of course, I'm a Data Guy. Treat the numbers with caution, because it's easy to build bad models or otherwise screw up in umpteen ways when working with complex statistical data under deadline pressure. But at the end of the day, we all have to make decisions based on incomplete information. Businesses particularly face this problem: new hires or capital investments typically have a long time horizon. If you're not going to make these choices based on your best estimate of the situation, given the relevant uncertainties — well, what exactly are you going to base them on?These days, I'd say my relationship with the Data Guy label has become more fraught. In one of my particular subfields, election forecasting, there's been a lot of bad work, which probably did more to misinform the conversation than contribute to it. And more broadly, I do buy to some extent that \"science has been politicized\". Sometimes I've seen the admonition \"just trust the numbers\" used as a blunt insturment to suppress legitimate dissent. Data is collected by and interpreted by humans, and human error and bias play a role at every step of the process.The important thing is to be right, and probably 90 percent of the time, going through the rigor of kicking the tires on the data2 and then explicitly modeling a situation helps you get there. But I'll give a little more weight these days to the mesoscale rather than the micro. Having a good bullshit detector — heuristics honed by life experience — comes in handy that remaining 10 percent of the time.When it comes to economic data produced by the United States government, however, people play that 10 percent \"get out of jail free\" card far too often. And usually, they're the ones producing the bullshit, often to spin away politically inconvenient data.ShareU.S. economic data is pretty reliableI've worked a lot with data produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and other federal agencies. In fact, an economic index based on a half-dozen of these statistics is part of our presidential election forecast, so we've pulled this data all the way back to World War II.3 And I consider it to be of very high quality. When BLS data is revised as more information becomes available, it's meticulously documented and explained. For more on how this works, including just how difficult the BLS's job is and how it's being made harder by declining survey response rates and cuts to federal agencies that track economic activity, I'd strongly recommend this edition of the Odd Lots podcast with Bill Beach, the former BLS commissioner under Trump 1.0 and Biden. It might not be the most riveting interview, but one thing that comes through is just how much of a straight-shooter he is:And yes, U.S. government economic data is revised — more for some data series than for others — because measuring something as complex as the modern American economy is an incredibly challenging task. Moreover, the BLS and other federal agencies are essentially trying to serve two purposes at once. On the one hand, they're hoping to provide actionable information as fast as they reasonably can to employers, investors, job-seekers, policymakers and the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, they're trying to formulate a \"permanent record\", data that is treated as ground truth in future economic analysis. Those imply taking different positions in the unavoidable trade-off between speed and precision. That doesn't mean the BLS doesn't face challenges like the ones that Beach outlined. A particular problem in recent reports seems to have been in overestimating state and local educational jobs, for instance.And there's also a more subtle factor at play. When data is published as part of the official record, there's going to be a tendency to do things \"by the book\" in a way that establishes greater transparency or more consistency with past methods. Tyler Cowen considers this a \"bias\" of its own kind, and perhaps there's something to that. Sometimes, when we're publishing a model at Silver Bulletin, there will be times when I don't think it's handling a particular situation well, reflecting either a weird one-off circumstance or a potential change from the past regime of data that the model is trained on. But I'm usually reluctant to make ad hoc changes midstream in what we publish publicly. On the other hand, if I'm actually betting on something, I don't necessarily care so much about the propriety of keeping up consistency — I just want to be on the right side of the wager. So if there's something that catches my eye4, I'll gamble (literally) on deviating from the process. We probably don't want government agencies having that sort of attitude, though.The job numbers suggest the economy is slowing, and Trump is in denial about itOn Friday, the BLS released its monthly Employment Situation Summary, more informally known as the \"jobs report\". The jobs report is actually two separate surveys: a survey of households, from which the unemployment rate is derived, and a survey of \"establishments\" (businesses), which is where the \"headline\" number comes from showing how many jobs were gained or lost in the previous month.This latter figure, officially called \"total nonfarm payrolls,\" is considered more reliable and is the one that tends to move markets and public perception. (It's also the one we use in Silver Bulletin models.) That's partly because it includes a considerably larger sample size. The BLS surveys approximately 120,000 businesses and government agencies each month for the establishment survey, some of which have dozens or hundreds of employees. By contrast, 60,000 eligible households are surveyed, which might have one or two members of the workforce each.The headline payrolls figure wasn't good on Friday: 73,000 net jobs added in July, lower than the recent average of around 200,000 jobs added per month from July 2023 through June 2025. What was worse, though, were the revisions to the past two months. May's figure was revised downward by 125,000, and the government now estimates that just 19,000 jobs were added that month. And it was basically the same story for June's figures, which will be revised again next month. Instead of 147,000 jobs, as initially estimated last month, the figure has been revised to just 14,000 jobs. The three-month average of 35,000 jobs added is still positive at least — but just barely so. The last time it was negative was during the pandemic, when more than 20 million jobs (!) were lost in a single month in April 2020 — and before then, in late 2010, as the economy was still sputtering its way out of the Great Recession, contributing to a terrible midterm for Barack Obama.The White House initially put on a cheery face, putting out a tweet that celebrated the 73,000 jobs, which I compared to the New York Jets congratulating themselves for having won five games last season (they lost the other 12). By Friday afternoon, however, Trump had demanded the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the current BLS commissioner who was confirmed 86-6 by the Senate under Biden in 2024. I suppose I'll let you see the president's rationale for this in his own words as he posted them to Truth Social:These were big revisions, but well within historical normsEach monthly payrolls figure is actually revised three times: once in each of the first two months after initial publication (so July's 73,000 figure will be re-reported in August and then again in September) and then again each January as part of the BLS's annual benchmark revisions. For the rest of today's newsletter, I'm just going to ignore the benchmarking process and focus on the first two monthly revisions. Here's what those monthly revisions have looked like for the past two years of jobs data:There are two obvious things to note here. First, the revisions are often quite large, swamping the initial signal. For instance, August 2024 was initially reported as a better month (+142K jobs) than July 2024 (+114K), but after revisions, August was actually slow (+78K) whereas July was fine (+144K). Economics reporters at major news outlets are often too quick to treat the initial figures as gospel, declaring whether the report was a \"beat\" or a \"bust\" relative to expectations, and fail to inform their readers about the routinely large revisions and the difficulties in estimation. All of this feels a little too familiar: it's the same thing that happens when news organizations breathlessly report polling data without considering the margin of error and other challenges for surveys.Second, the trend in recent revisions has been negative, including — as Trump alluded to in his Truth Social post — for all months so far of Trump 2.0.This is actually common enough, too, though. Empirically, the revisions in the BLS jobs report aren't purely random; instead, there's some positive correlation in the direction of revisions from month to month5, sometimes producing long streaks of upward or downward revisions. This implies that they don't purely result from sampling error; instead there can be some pervasive statistical biases from month to month, especially when the economy is facing some sort of trauma or disruption. This may reflect the sort of lower-case \"c\" conservative \"bias\" that Cowen describes: a reluctance to change methods even when the underlying situation is changing.I'll show you more data on this in a moment — but first, it's important to note that statistical bias isn't the same thing as political bias. Revisions were also mostly downward for Biden during the 2024 election campaign, except for the last figure reported just before the election on Nov. 1, when the initial number was nearly negative before being revised upward to +43K.Moreover, if the BLS had been out to get Trump, revising numbers downward wouldn't be the way to do it. The revisions usually don't get as much media attention as the headline figures. If May's number had initially been reported as just +19K jobs instead of being revised down later, and June at +14K, there would have been more concern from investors for the past couple of months and more of a narrative that Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, announced on April 2, were already taking their toll on Main Street.6But as compared to the long run, the May and June revisions are relatively pedestrian. The largest change ever to an initial jobs figure ever after two months came in March 2020 as the pandemic hit American shores; initially reported as a job loss of 700,000, it was later revised to nearly 1.4 million instead.Under the circumstances, though, this was understandable given the magnitude of the losses. The next month, April, the BLS initially reported that 20,537,000 jobs (!) were lost. This was later revised to −20,787,000, which counts as a large revision (−250K) relative to the usual monthly changes — but not as compared to the unprecedented disruptions the pandemic caused. And currently, there are about 160,000,000 jobs in the U.S. according to the payrolls report. The absolute value of revisions7 has averaged about 60,000 jobs over the past decade, which is only about 0.04 percent of total payroll employment.So you have to sort down to the fifth page in the table of the biggest revisions before the June 2025 revision of −133K jobs pops into the window. Since 1979, the effective margin of error on the initially-reported headline number, enough to cover 95 percent of the changes in the first two monthly revisions, has been around 160,000 jobs. So neither May nor June even counts as an outlier in a statistical sense.You can also sort the table by month, in which case you'll find evidence for my claim that there are often more problems at economic turning points. Pandemic job loss was initially underestimated in March and April 2020. But then the recovery was also underestimated, with initial reports lowballing job growth for 11 consecutive months from April 2021 though February 2022 — no help, by the way, to Biden, who was trying to sell a story of a robust labor market despite high inflation. Meanwhile, revisions were negative for nine consecutive months from June 2008 through February 2009 as the global financial system was coming unraveled.The downward revisions reflect what businesses and economists were worried aboutThis is very much not financial advice. For the record, I own a fair amount of equities, and I'm not planning on making any changes to my portfolio. But it's possible to read all of this as being rather bearish. Economists were wondering why the tariffs weren't having more effect given gloomy consumer and employer sentiment numbers. Even though Trump has backed out of some tariffs, they still represent the largest effective tariff rate since under Smoot-Hawley in the 1930s. If government agencies have trouble dealing with unprecedented situations8, it could be that this portends future downward revisions, as was the case in the acute stages of the pandemic and the global financial crisis.I'm cribbing some of this from Joe Weisenthal, the Bloomberg reporter who is the co-host of Odd Lots. Weisenthal noticed that basically all recent jobs gains are from the health care sector, which is presumably going to grow in perpetuity as the American population ages. Meanwhile, outside of health care, the one big boon to the economy has been the extraordinary capital investments in AI. But while this AI spending may be great for the stock market9 and can even produce some NBA-style compensation packages for superstar engineers, it probably won't result in a lot of (human) employment broadly and of course may wind up displacing jobs in the end.So we've got the AI boom and zombie-like growth in health care as the population ages. And perhaps not much else — although as Josh Barro notes, there are some complications around immigration.10In April, the chances of a recession in 2025 were trading above 60 percent at Polymarket as investors — in line with the overwhelming majority of academic economists — predicted a severe effect from the tariffs. Now, recession chances are trading at 15 percent. That's slightly higher than 12 percent before Friday's report, but we're probably not going to get a recession declared this year — in part because the year is more than half over.11 But there's nevertheless a degree of \"fuck around and find out\" to all of this. We're seeing signs of slower growth (and faster inflation) in the hard data that was mostly only showing up in the soft data before12 — and the timing lines up conspicuously with when Trump escalated his trade wars. Data denialism will do nothing to help TrumpI'm not sure exactly where firing the BLS commissioner ranks on the list of Trump-related outrages. Even if Congress does its job and McEntarfer is replaced with another competent successor, this could have a chilling effect on BLS and other government agencies to operate independently. It's also not surprising given Trump's previous incursions on the independence of the Federal Reserve and other government agencies. This is the guy who sued a pollster for publishing results13 he didn't like.14 Unlike in some other instances, though, I don't see how there's any real political gain for Trump in yet again undermining longstanding norms and institutions.Silver Bulletin is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support our work, consider becoming a subscriber.If the government's jobs data is considered biased or unreliable, Wall Street will have other places to look. ADP reports figures on private payrolls, for instance. (And it also tells a bearish story: ADP showed a net loss of jobs in June, for instance.) Meanwhile, Gallup once tracked employment numbers on a weekly basis based on its large-scale surveys and could resume that effort. Or investment banks like Goldman Sachs might conclude they could have a competitive edge by tracking their own economic data.However, this data is likely to be lower quality, because private organizations usually have lower response rates to surveys than the government does. And no longer having any reliable \"ground truth\" for major American economic data series will create more uncertainty for businesses and investors overall, which will discourage the sort healthy risk-taking that often fuels job growth. More generally, America benefits, particularly in our ability to borrow cheaply, from economic \"soft power\" in the form of being considered a reliable and transparent actor. Trump has eroded those foundations in his second term in a way he didn't so much in his first, and I've been skeptical of the notion that markets will discipline him as much as others seem to assume.Nor are job-seekers likely to be fooled. They can assess the situation for themselves based on their success at finding employment or the experiences of their friends and neighbors. The same holds, perhaps even more so, when it comes to higher prices, which are literally visible any time they go to the grocery store or drive past a gas station.There is far too much belief among political types that voters' views of the economy reflect narrative or spin, rather than being cross-checked against the ground truth they're experiencing in their own lives. The Biden White House was also guilty of this, chalking up voter concerns about inflation to \"misinformation\" when low consumer confidence numbers not only highly understandable but also consistent with past periods of high inflation.In the long run, reduced reliability of American economic data will not only harm the economy by increasing uncertainty for businesses but could also exacerbate the decades-long sense of negativity from voters in how the country is doing overall. Left to their own devices because they don't think there's any trustworthy authority, people are often biased toward thinking the situation is worse than it is. That could make life harder on incumbents trying to convince voters that the economy is healthy even when it really is.But for now, Republicans are the incumbent party — and if you ask me, tariffs and an economic slowdown are a far bigger threat to Trump's political capital than the distractions that often dominate the news cycle from day to day. We have more evidence now that the economy is slowing down, probably because of tariffs. And Trump's actions on Friday suggest he's scared to face the consequences.1I'm no longer a pickleball virgin.2This first step is very important. I'm currently working on a revised and improved NFL model for Silver Bulletin, and probably 80 percent of the work is in gathering, cleaning and QC'ing the data, whereas only 20 percent is actually the fun part of building out the logic of the model and testing empirical questions.3And tried to estimate it back to 1860 based on less complete information.4Say, I'm betting on an NBA game, one team looks extremely fatigued, and there are rumors that they were out at the strip club late the previous night.5About .18.6I guess if you wanted to play devil's advocate, it's also more likely that we'd have gotten the rate cut that Trump wants. But we'd have gotten a cut because the Fed correctly perceived that the economy was struggling.7Meaning, regardless of direction: there is little long-term directional bias in jobs revisions.8Reliable economic data in the U.S. generally dates back to World War II, so there's nothing like Smoot-Hawley reflected in the dataset.9Outside of index funds, the only other thing I really do with my portfolio is weight it slightly toward some individual AI-adjacent stocks.10If the Trump administration is successful in reducing the number of people who come into the United States, that might lead to fewer jobs since many immigrants come here for work. But it won't necessarily harm the unemployment rate if there are fewer overall people (including some who are here illegally) in the country seeking jobs. The White House, indeed, has highlighted the gains for native-born workers as compared to foreign-born ones. I don't think \"we'll reduce immigration so much that the economy might go into recession\" was necessarily part of Trump's pitch for how he'd run the economy. But it's a better attempt at spin than pretending that the recent jobs numbers look healthy on the surface.11The Polymarket contract specifies that the recession must be declared by December 31, 2025 or that there are two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. Recessions are typically reported by the NBER with a lag of a few months, though. And the recent second-quarter GDP print was positive, although with some caveats. It wouldn't be so surprising if it's later determined that we entered a recession in the second half of 2025 — but we might not know it until next year.12Check out a data series I know well, for instance: Vegas tourism numbers.13Admittedly, highly inaccurate results.14The lawsuit has since been dropped.",

I personally avoid AI as much as humanly possible but when faced with group projects—which is all my uni will ever make me do—it is dauntingly unavoidable. Last semester, I had to do a group project, and pretty much every single person in my group used ChatGPT for the texts we were meant to write into the book for the project.It is difficult to put into words the amount of rage that I felt as I was reading these soulless, generic, bland texts. Not only were they stylistically flat, but much of the information was either incredibly basic or just blatantly incorrect. After gathering myself and taking a few deep breaths, I texted our group chat asking if they had used ChatGPT—wanting to see if they were to at least have a glimmer of shame over it—and of course they said yes. I bit my tongue and instead of cussing them out, I calmly explained that if I can tell that the texts are AI, our teachers certainly can too.Of course, the foundations of what AI did were still very much there, and one of them even used an AI humanizer to rewrite their part (just imagine how much angrier I was after finding that out), so nothing past a few words truly changed. I drew so many parallels between this experience and this experiment; understanding that AI has infiltrated the classroom is a reality that we must face, however, questioning all of its implications is something that also must be done as we enter this new era of education.the reading nook\"Let people enjoy things\" NO.

As I was walking out of the theater, eager to discuss all of my critiques and comments with my parents, I heard so many people saying how good the movie was. In my head, I was thinking \"Did we really just watch the same movie?\".This incident solidified my conclusion that people often mistake entertainment for quality. This post is a very long rant which I deeply resonate with; she particularly draws attention to the literary world, but I find that her arguments are equally relevant regarding most forms of media. This epidemic of lack of media literacy that is taking place, is something that concerns me as I know how easy it is to turn our brains off and get cheap dopamine hits from entertaining slop.Broken Sleep on AeonEssay analyzing how sleep patterns from the past can be a tool for creativity as the brain works differently in the middle of the night.I wake up angry and exhausted every single day at the fact that my circadian rhythms are incompatible with modern-day life. If it were up to me, I would fall asleep at 4 am to then wake up at noon every single day. I am a chronic insomniac, and even when I do end up falling asleep at the crack of dawn, life gets in the way of my getting the hours of sleep that I actually need. I hate that the world doesn't wait til' I'm ready for it, leaving daytime to be a hurdle to tackle amidst the fatigue from the night before.There truly is something about the stillness of the night that has a liminal quality to it, creating a fertile ground for ideas to blossom. I often find myself waking up in the middle of the night with a rush of energy coursing through my veins; it is as though I become a vessel for some sort of divine download in which I can't help but grab something to write on and channel this energy through the pen into the paper.I hate that my most productive hours seem to be the ones meant for rest. The sleep pattern that the essay is referring to is now perhaps seen as a sleep disorder, but for many—including myself—it seems like a way out. I just hope I get the privilege of getting to live a life dictated by the natural rhythms of my body and not the ones forced on me by some corporate job.Instead of Doomscrolling is a reader-supported publication.

Stillness is the ultimate vessel for transformation, because nature will inevitably take its course, and erosion will always become the blank canvas for new cycles to begin. No matter how much we attempt to control change, decay will always be the overriding force.My body is decaying, and so is the keyboard I'm writing on, and so is the \"cloud\" I store these words in, and so are my memories, and so is the planet, and so are you. In an existence fueled by uncertainty, the fact that everything is slowly decomposing is the one thing I can always fall back on. The insignificance of being in the grand scheme of a universe, one where I am a momentary blip of energy coming together, to then fall apart to return to the source, is somehow as liberating as it is haunting. This video essay—as you can probably tell—sent me in a bit of an existential spiral. This is genuinely one of the most impactful videos I have ever seen, she creates this complex web of connections between fiction, reality, nature, humans, media, and so much more. I will be thinking about this video for a very long time. The Subtle Art of Women's Work, Arachne the Weaver on Let's Talk About Myths Baby!Podcast analyzing the historic minimization of women's work seen through the Greek myth of Arachne the Weaver. This podcast made me take a good look at my internal bias that has been generated by a life of patriarchal conditioning. As a Greek mythology and fiber arts lover, I was of course familiar with this tale, it always resonated deeply with me and felt sort of empowering. This time around though, I saw it from a slightly different perspective. Something as fundamental as weaving for the progress of humanity as a whole had been reduced to a simple womanly art to keep women hidden away, and I had just accepted it at face value. I draw parallels between this craft and the perception of women, both reduced to value relative to beauty over function to take away their power. If it were to had been acknowledged that women's labor was a vocation, it would have then translated into independence and liberation. History has unfortunately been written and interpreted by the loudest voices in the room—which of course would be men—leaving so much room to revisit these ancient stories and allow all voices to be heard. Are You Experiencing Posting Ennui? on The New YorkerEssay examining how the shifts on social media over the last decade have resulted in hesitation to post from regular users as influencers and corporations have taken over. Social media used to be fun, I wouldn't think twice about what I posted and nothing was ever that serious, the chronological algorithm always made sure to show me all of my friends' posts and I was never being coerced into buying anything. Now, posting feels like a chore, knowing that most of my friends won't even get to see my posts as everything is now buried under the money-making content.The mixture between capitalism and the nonchalance epidemic has left our feeds feeling like a marketplace with very occasional hyper-curated posts from someone we know. Between influencers, celebrities, brands, and ads, social media has taken us out of the equation, leaving us in the role of spectators and consumers. You know when a brand comments on a post and sucks all of the fun out of whatever we were laughing about? That's the exact same feeling that I've felt as I've witnessed this strange shift.Human, beingThe Post-Wellness EraWhenever a note takes off and spreads like wildfire, I take it as a sign that a deeper conversation lies beneath the surface and must be excavated...Read morea month ago · 762 likes · 69 comments · Erin NystromSubstack post breaking down how the self-optimization pipeline leads to a post-wellness era away from perfectionist and consumerist \"health\" habits. This post unfortunately hit too close to home, as someone who has struggled with their health a lot, I have fallen—and made it out the other side—of this insane wellness rabbit hole. The mixture between doctors, nutritionists, and the internet can be a pretty destructive combination, they often leave you bound to an all-or-nothing mentality as the only way to heal yourself. Once I understood that I am not a device that needs to be endlessly optimized, but a human being with emotions, desires, and needs, I began reframing what health meant to me. I guess this is where I landed in my post-wellness era. I now know that going to dinner with friends, splitting a bottle of wine, and ending the night with gelato can be infinitely better for me than whatever high-protein, sugar-free, low-carb meal I had waiting at home.

      "content": "In most wealthy nations, women have steadily closed the gap with men in education, income, and professional achievement. Today, they earn the majority of undergraduate and graduate degrees, including doctorates. More than half of all STEM degrees now go to women, and their presence in the tech industry has grown—from 31 percent in 2019 to 35 percent in 2023. In major metropolitan areas like Boston, New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., women under 30 now match or outearn their male peers.Given these gains, one might expect that as men and women converge in education and income, their cultural values and outlook on the world would also grow more aligned. Yet the opposite seems to be happening.Nowhere is this divergence more striking than in politics. Since 2014, young women in the U.S. have grown increasingly left-leaning, while the political orientation of young men has remained relatively stable. By 2021, 44 percent of young women identified as liberal, compared with just 25 percent of young men—the largest gender gap in political affiliation recorded in 24 years of polling.Why would men and women grow more politically divided even as they become more economically and educationally alike? The answer lies in persistent psychological and behavioral sex differences that continue to shape how each group sees the world.Even in our supposedly enlightened times, \"Is it a boy or a girl?\" is still the first question asked of nearly every newborn—and the answer continues to shape how the child is raised. Research shows that from infancy, boys and girls are touched, comforted, spoken to, and treated differently by parents and caregivers. These early experiences may reinforce sex-typical patterns of behavior that often persist into adulthood.People are intrinsically fascinated by psychological sex differences—the average differences between men and women in personality, behavior, and preferences. Psychologists have studied this topic systematically for decades, beginning with landmark works like The Psychology of Sex Differences (1974) by Eleanor Maccoby and Carol Jacklin. That book helped spark a wave of research that continues to this day. Since then, increasingly sophisticated methods have enabled researchers to detect subtle but consistent differences in how men and women think, feel, and act.Men and women use language and think about the world in broadly similar ways. They experience the same basic emotions. Both seek kind, intelligent, and attractive romantic partners, enjoy sex, get jealous, make sacrifices for their children, compete for status, and sometimes resort to aggression in pursuit of their interests. In the end, women and men are more alike than different. But they are not identical.To be sure, sociocultural influences play a role in creating those differences. But environmental factors don't act on blank slates. To understand young men and young women, we must consider not only cultural context but also evolved sex differences. We are, after all, biological creatures. Like other mammals, we share similar physiology and emotional systems, so it's not surprising that meaningful differences exist between human males and females.To understand why psychological and behavioral sex differences evolved, the key concept is parental investment theory, developed by evolutionary biologist Robert Trivers in 1972. The basic idea is straightforward: the sex that invests more in offspring tends to be more selective when choosing a mate. This selectivity follows basic evolutionary logic: those with more to lose are more cautious and risk-averse. To put the stakes in perspective: raising a child from birth to independence in a traditional, preindustrial society requires an estimated 10 million to 13 million calories—the equivalent of about 20,000 Big Macs. For women, reproduction is enormously expensive.Men also incur reproductive costs, though of a different kind. On average, they have about 20 percent more active metabolic tissue—such as muscle—that fuels their efforts in competition, courtship, and provisioning. While pregnancy requires a large, immediate investment from women, men's reproductive effort is more gradual, spread out over a lifetime. In evolutionary terms, both sexes pay a price for reproduction, but in different currencies—women through gestation and caregiving, men through physical competition and resource acquisition.Yet while nature can inform our understanding of human behavior, it does not dictate how we ought to live. A clearer grasp of sex differences can help guide our decisions. It cannot define our values.Most people understand that physically, men and women are not the same. Prior to puberty, boys and girls are physically similar in size, strength, and skill—except when it comes to throwing. By the age of three, boys can throw objects farther, faster, and with greater accuracy than girls. No other physical activity in early childhood shows such a pronounced gap between the sexes. As they get older, boys across cultures refine this ability—tossing sticks, stones, balls, or whatever is at hand. By adolescence, their advantage in throwing ability has tripled. The male edge in throwing power and speed is evident even in the smallest hunter-gatherer societies.During this period, boys also begin to outperform girls in a wide range of other physical skills, including sprinting and distance running, vertical and horizontal jumping, catching, sit-ups, balance, and grip strength. These differences are largely driven by puberty, which triggers dramatic increases in boys' height, weight, and muscle mass. By this stage, the physical gap between the sexes is so pronounced that minimal overlap exists in these abilities.Relatedly, human puberty leads to larger noses in boys to provide the oxygen they need to power their larger muscle mass. A typical teenage male will grow a nose about 10 percent bigger than that of a typical girl his size. Similarly, during pregnancy, women carrying male fetuses consume nearly 10 percent more calories than those carrying female ones.It's not just physical traits that differ. Men and women also show differences in areas like personality. Over the past few decades, the most widely supported framework among personality researchers has been the Five-Factor Model, which identifies five core traits.Openness to Experience. People high in openness tend to be more creative and entrepreneurial, seek out new information and perspectives, and are more likely to get tattoos or piercings. They're also more willing to relocate for school or work, compared with those who score low on this trait.Conscientiousness. People who score high on this trait are industrious and tend to excel in school and at work. They are punctual, report greater job satisfaction, save more money, stick to exercise routines, and hold themselves to high standards.Extroversion. Compared with introverts, extroverts enjoy social attention and are more likely to take on leadership roles. They tend to be more cooperative, have more friends and sex partners, and be more socially active. They also tend to drive faster and more recklessly—and get into more car accidents.Agreeableness. Agreeable individuals tend to avoid conflict and prefer negotiation and compromise. They value harmonious social environments and want everyone to get along. They typically score high on measures of empathy and spend more time volunteering or helping others. They're more likely to withdraw from confrontation and care deeply about being liked.Emotional Stability. The hallmark of this trait is emotional steadiness: how much a person's mood fluctuates. Those low in emotional stability (i.e., high in neuroticism) tend to react strongly to everyday setbacks and minor frustrations. Those higher in emotional stability are generally less prone to anxiety and depression and bounce back more easily from stress.Each of these five broad personality traits includes a range of specific facets that capture the nuance and complexity of individual variations. For example, the global trait of conscientiousness includes six facets: competence, orderliness, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, and deliberation. Emotional stability encompasses facets such as anxiety, hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsivity, and vulnerability.Men and women differ on some of the Big Five personality traits, with the most pronounced differences found in agreeableness and emotional stability. Women consistently score higher than men on agreeableness. Two key facets of this trait—trust and tender-mindedness—help explain the gap. Trust reflects a tendency to cooperate with others and give them the benefit of the doubt. Tender-mindedness involves empathy and sympathy, particularly toward the disadvantaged. Women score significantly higher than men on both. This may help explain why women tend to be more politically progressive than men. Agreeableness correlates with political orientation: the higher someone scores on this trait, the more likely the person is to identify as a liberal.There is also a notable sex difference in emotional stability, with women scoring moderately lower than men. The anxiety facet shows the largest sex gap across cultures, with women consistently scoring higher. Other measures indicate that women also score higher on fearfulness and feelings of vulnerability. Interestingly, a 2021 study found that physical strength significantly reduces the sex differences in anxiety and fearfulness—suggesting that elevated levels of these traits may be adaptive for individuals who are less physically formidable. The researchers propose that \"some sex-based variation in personality may be partly attributable to variation in physical attributes.\" Low emotional stability is associated with a greater likelihood of holding liberal political views, perhaps helping to explain some of the observed political differences between men and women.Adult men and women differ both in the incidence of depression and in the nature of their depressive symptoms—but these differences don't appear in childhood. Before puberty, rates of depression are similar across sexes. After puberty, however, women experience depression at roughly twice the rate of men—a finding replicated in 25 European countries. About 25 percent of women will experience at least one depressive episode in their lifetime, compared with just 10 percent of men.Low levels of emotional stability can sometimes be useful. As Tyler Cowen and Daniel Gross suggest in their book on talent spotting, \"If you are looking to hire a crusader on behalf of a social justice cause, someone who will notice injustices and then complain about them, neuroticism might be a desirable trait.\"Mental health does appear to influence political ideology more than the reverse. Researcher Zach Goldberg has shown that rising levels of psychological distress predict later increases in liberal attitudes among girls and among liberals of both sexes, as well as a rise in liberal self-identification. In a series of studies, Vicki Helgeson and Heidi Fritz explored sex differences in what they call \"unmitigated communion\"—defined as \"an excessive concern with others and placing others' needs before one's own.\" To measure it, they developed a simple scale where participants rated their agreement with statements such as \"For me to be happy, I need others to be happy\" and \"I often worry about others' problems.\" Women consistently score higher than men. This may help explain why modern political activism is often so feminine in style—what Kay Hymowitz has described as \"the new girl disorder,\" rooted in concern for others.Interestingly, countries with greater sociopolitical equality and gender egalitarianism tend to show the largest sex differences in personality traits. For example, men and women in highly egalitarian countries like Denmark and Sweden differ more from each other than do men and women in more traditional societies such as Vietnam and Botswana.This association between sociopolitical equality and larger sex differences holds for the Big Five personality traits and for other behaviors as well. Take crying: women across cultures cry more than men, but the gap is especially pronounced in rich countries with high levels of sociopolitical equality.The same pattern appears in educational preferences. In developing countries, women are more likely to study engineering and other lucrative fields. In richer countries, where economic security is more assured, women tend to opt for less remunerative majors such as communications or psychology.In relatively rich and free societies, people are better able to express their underlying traits and preferences. In contrast, less affluent and less egalitarian societies tend to impose stricter behavioral expectations, which compress sex differences. Psychologist Steve Stewart-Williams has summed up this dynamic succinctly: \"Treating men and women the same makes them different, and treating them differently makes them the same.\" Even sex differences in height, BMI, obesity, and blood pressure are larger in countries with more egalitarian sex-role socialization. Across societies, men tend to be taller and heavier and to have higher blood pressure than women—but these differences are especially large in wealthier nations. In materially scarce environments, men's physical development is more constrained relative to women's. Put simply, men have greater physical capacity for growth and change, and material abundance—particularly adequate food and nutrition—allows those underlying traits to emerge more fully.Many in Western societies assume that treating men and women the same will naturally lead to convergence in their interests and preferences. But the world doesn't work that way. The freer people are and the more fairly they're treated, the more their differences tend to emerge rather than disappear. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that young men and women are diverging politically more than previous generations did.A baby boy born in the U.S. faces an astonishing risk profile. Men are three times more likely to die before age 25, three times more likely to become addicted to drugs or alcohol, and 19 times more likely to end up in jail.A man is more than twice as likely as a woman to be in a car accident—and three times as likely to be involved in two. Even as pedestrians, men take more risks: twice as many men as women are killed while simply crossing the street. Maleness is by far the strongest risk factor for violence. Men kill other men at a rate 26 times higher than women kill women.Oxford evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar has observed that when two women converse, they usually face each other directly. The same is true when a woman and a man are speaking. But when two men are engaged in friendly conversation, they almost always stand at an angle—about 120 degrees—nearly side by side. This is because, traditionally, the only time men stare directly at each other is when they're about to engage in verbal or physical conflict.Men have a higher tolerance for pain. In experimental studies using identical pain-inducing stimuli, women consistently responded more quickly to bodily injury and endured it for less time than men. This difference diminished with age but never disappeared.An evolutionary model offers an explanation. Because the reproductive ceiling is much higher for males than it is for females, the variance in reproductive success differs significantly between the sexes. In fact, 8,000 years ago, 17 women reproduced for every one man. As a rule, the greater the variance in reproduction, the more ferocious the competition within the sex showing the higher variance. Throughout evolutionary history, men have engaged in high-risk competition for the status and resources that boost their attractiveness to potential mates. With greater aggression comes higher likelihood of injury and death—one reason that men are more often the victims of violence than women.Homicide is a crime committed overwhelmingly by young men. While material conditions and ideological factors can amplify or restrain violent behavior, the evolutionary roots of this impulse predate humanity itself. Globally, men commit more than 90 percent of homicides. As noted earlier, most victims are also male—about 70 percent. Interestingly, the same pattern holds for chimpanzees: 92 percent of chimpanzee killers and 73 percent of their victims are male.Violent death rates among hunter-gatherer societies with little or no contact with Western culture exceed those of even the most crime-ridden cities in contemporary America. In these societies, roughly one in seven men dies because of homicide. A global assessment of 31 hunter-gatherer groups found that 64 percent engaged in warfare once every two years—conflicts carried out almost exclusively by men.In a 2012 paper published in Human Nature, the authors observed that \"if modern Western societies had homicide rates as high as some foraging peoples, a male graduate student would be more likely to be killed than to get a tenure-track position.\" Many have noted that women seem overrepresented in disruptive campus protests—but elite colleges often select individuals who do not conform to traditional gender norms. In the real world, antisocial behavior like vandalism and violence remains overwhelmingly male.Unsurprisingly, wealth has a clearer impact on reproductive success for men than for women. Wealthy men tend to have more children than poor men, while the fertility gap between rich and poor women is much smaller. This is partly because a woman's reproductive potential doesn't depend on how many partners she can attract. A man with 20 wives can father 20 children at once; a woman with 20 husbands cannot. This basic asymmetry helps account for some of the persistent differences in male and female sexual preferences.A 2016 study of 33 nonindustrialized, small-scale societies found that men's status—measured by wealth and political influence—is positively associated with several reproductively relevant outcomes, including number of sex partners, number of offspring, and number of offspring surviving into adulthood.In modern societies, the same pattern holds. Men who attain high income or occupational prestige are significantly more likely to find a long-term partner and have children. A 2019 study found that men at the top of the earnings distribution have more than a 90 percent chance of securing a committed romantic partner; for men at the bottom, that figure falls below 40 percent. In most societies, successful men attempt to convert their status into reproductive success.On average, men's self-esteem is more closely tied to salary, social status, and wealth—and these factors also shape their desirability as romantic partners, according to studies of female mate preferences. This helps explain why men are more likely to work long hours, relocate for jobs, and sacrifice their health in pursuit of career advancement. Women with high incomes, postgraduate degrees, and prestigious professions tend to place even greater value on wealth and status in a husband than other women do.Even in the most egalitarian countries, men tend to prefer more sex partners than women do. In Norway, researchers asked how many sex partners people would like over the next 30 years. On average, women preferred five; men preferred 25. Despite what glossy magazines might suggest, it is men who are the most enthusiastic about polyamory. They are twice as likely as women to have participated in a polyamorous relationship and three times as likely to want one. Men are also far more supportive of non-monogamy, open relationships, friends with benefits, throuples, and swinging.Many objections to research on sex differences stem from a sentimental belief that nature ought to support progressive political ideals. Consider sexual behavior: progressives often assume that casual sex is both natural and healthy. So when studies show that men are more inclined toward it and enjoy it more than women, many take this as a moral affront, as if it implies that men are liberated while women are repressed.This discomfort has given rise to new categories like \"demisexual\"—a term used mostly by young women who experience sexual attraction only after forming an emotional bond. In essence, it reframes a traditional romantic norm. But in a culture where emotional commitment and monogamy are often dismissed or pathologized, some young women feel compelled to invent a new sexual orientation simply to legitimize their natural preference for commitment.Due to these sex differences, all else being equal, mothers and fathers have historically been more motivated to pass their wealth to their sons than to their daughters. Rich sons had the potential to father far more children than rich daughters could bear. In part, this reproductive logic helped fuel the global spread of gender inequality.Over the past few decades, researchers have quietly uncovered a consistent, if uncomfortable, pattern: boys are more fragile than they seem. Compared with girls, they are more sensitive to instability, more affected by parenting quality, and more likely to struggle when structure breaks down. These vulnerabilities may not be obvious early on, but by adolescence and adulthood, the effects compound. In schools, job markets, and relationships, more young men are falling behind—not because they lack potential but because they depend more on environmental support that is increasingly absent.Interestingly, while childhood instability is linked with riskier and more harmful behaviors in adulthood, childhood poverty is not. A 2016 study led by psychologist Jenalee Doom at the University of Minnesota's Institute of Child Development revealed that rich kids from unstable homes are far likelier to abuse drugs than poor kids from stable homes. Instability also appears to affect boys more than girls. Psychologist Peter K. Jonason and his colleagues found that among men—but not women—childhood instability was associated with higher scores on the Dark Triad: aggression, impulsivity, and disregard for others. Childhood socioeconomic status had no effect on these traits.The effects of instability are especially striking when viewed through the lens of gender. In a 2016 study, Harvard economist Raj Chetty examined boys and girls born between 1980 and 1982 in the same disadvantaged neighborhoods. By age 30, the women had achieved better economic and educational outcomes than the men. This gender gap in college attendance exists across all income levels but is widest among the poor. Among affluent families, girls are only slightly more likely than boys to attend college. Among low-income families, girls are far more likely to do so.The pattern reverses in intact families. Among children raised by poor, married parents, boys are slightly less likely than girls to grow up unemployed. In other words, single parenthood appears especially detrimental for boys, while married-parent households offer them a particular advantage.These findings align with research by University of Chicago economist Marianne Bertrand, who found that while all children suffer in broken families, boys suffer more. Her study showed that boys raised by single parents are twice as likely to be suspended for disruptive behavior as girls in the same circumstances—and that this gender gap narrows significantly in intact families. \"All other family structures appear detrimental to boys,\" the study notes.It may be for this reason—the sex difference in responsiveness to environmental inputs—that most cultures throughout history have established rites of passage for boys. As psychologist Roy Baumeister observes, \"in many societies, any girl who grows up automatically becomes a woman. . . . Meanwhile, a boy does not automatically become a man, and instead is often required to prove himself, usually by passing stringent tests or producing more than he consumes.\"Anthropologist David Gilmore found similar examples across dozens of cultures. In Manhood in the Making, he argues that masculinity is not a biological given but a cultural achievement—one imposed on boys through testing, instruction, and often hardship. Left unguided, boys tend toward apathy, self-indulgence, and an aversion to responsibility. Contrary to the belief that males are naturally ambitious and risk-seeking, Gilmore shows that societies have long used rituals and norms to cultivate these traits in young men.Unlike femininity, which is grounded in biological milestones such as menstruation or childbirth, masculinity has always required external validation. A girl becomes a woman through processes largely beyond her control. A boy, by contrast, must prove he is a man—through work, risk, sacrifice, and service. In traditional societies, this meant demonstrating value to the group. Today, however, the scaffolding that once guided boys into manhood has eroded. The expectations once placed on young men—to work hard, support others, and pursue self-mastery—have largely disappeared. As a result, many are adrift.Ironically, the belief that males are innately power-hungry and in need of restraint has obscured a deeper truth: boys aren't overzealous; they're undermotivated. The real challenge isn't curbing male ambition but igniting it. Across cultures and centuries, societies understood that, left unguided, boys don't become dangerous; they become disengaged. Today, we've dismantled the norms that once shaped boys into men, removed the ladder, and then blamed them for not climbing it. If we want fewer young men retreating from school, work, and family life, we need to stop pathologizing masculinity—and start rebuilding the cultural pathways that once helped boys grow into responsible men.Despite growing equality in education and the workplace, men and women remain shaped by deep-seated biological and psychological differences that influence their values, behaviors, and politics. Paradoxically, in affluent and egalitarian societies, these differences become more pronounced, not diminished. Acknowledging these realities means designing institutions, norms, and policies that better reflect how men and women respond differently to freedom, adversity, and opportunity. If we hope to bridge current divides and build a more cohesive society, we must stop pretending that the sexes are interchangeable and instead draw strength from their differences.This article was originally published at City Journal under the title \"Sexual Politics.\"To receive new posts, access more than 100 premium archived posts, and support my work, consider becoming a subscriber",

      "content": "This August at The Portal we host philosopher Dylan Shaul for a series of reflections under the theme of \"Metaphysics Resurrected\". Throughout this month you are invited to four events designed to introduce you to the history of metaphysics, including: the core of the metaphysical tradition, from Plato to Leibniz, the Kantian turn opening us to a post-metaphysical universe, the possible return of metaphysics in contemporary philosophy, as well as reflections on the relation of pure reason and mystical knowing. The entire schedule can be found below:To get involved, you can either sign up as a member of The Portal, which gives you access to the entire history of our recordings, as well as four live events every month, and discounts on past/future courses; or you can sign up for the month as a stand alone mini-course, giving you access to all four live events, as well as lifetime access to the recordings. Find out more below:The PortalMetaphysics ResurrectedIn order to prepare for this month, I hosted a second conversation with Shaul, as well as Dimitri Crooijmans of and Daniel Coughlan of , to reflect on many of the themes that we hope to explore more fully throughout August. You can find that conversation below:What you can find below are some general themes that we hope to expand on in the course:The Negation of the Negation (Affirmation) of MetaphysicsThroughout the course we will be exploring the \"positive history of the metaphysical tradition\", including Plato, Aristotle, Neo-Platonists, Medieval Scholastics, and the Modern Rationalists; the \"critique of metaphysics\" from the works of Immanuel Kant and the German Idealists onwards; and also the possibility that we are either within or are in the process of realising a renewal/resurrection of metaphysics that results from the exhaustion of its negation (it is possible, to come).Special MetaphysicsMetaphysics as the study/sciences of causes can be split into two major branches: general metaphysics, or the study of being/ontology; and special metaphysics, which can itself be divided into three branches: rational cosmology, or the science of the world; rational psychology, or the science of the soul; and rational theology, or the science of god. These three branches will dominate our focus in this course, with special attention to their \"unconditioned\" nature. Here we will position the positive history of metaphysics (e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Neo-Platonism, Medieval Scholastics, Modern Rationalists) as the support for special metaphysics, and the Kantian critique as its deconstruction as \"transcendental illusion\" (e.g. world, soul, god). Political IdealsThe positive history of metaphysics has political consequences in concepts that we have come to see only in the form of transcendental illusion, but which perhaps require a new re-assessment: \"Kingdom of God\" and \"Heaven on Earth\". The Kingdom of God proposes the idea that only God is King, which in its negation means that: no human can be king over any other. The idea of Heaven on Earth is inspired by \"God as the Good\", and the highest \"Good\" as \"universal peace\" for all human beings. Combined, the political ideals of the \"Kingdom of God\" and \"Heaven on Earth\" form the basis for the striving, imitation and embodiment that classical metaphysics instantiates. Should these ideals be critiqued? Should these ideals be resurrected?What About Critique?This course is not just a \"return\" to the \"positive tradition of metaphysics\", but rather also trying to raise metaphysics inclusive of its negation and critique. This means that we cannot just go back to the basic presupposition of the positive tradition of metaphysics as if the critique did not happen. Any raising of the positive tradition of metaphysics must be done inclusive of the truth of its negation and critique. Here some questions that come to mind include: did the positive tradition of metaphysics already have its critical break internal to itself (e.g. sophists, materialists, empiricists, nominalists, skeptics), or even in figures like Descartes, who started to theorise the cogito under the paradigm of self-doubt. Perhaps more importantly, can the positive history of metaphysics withstand not only Kant's \"critique of pure reason\", but also the psychoanalytic break with \"death drive\", or the \"critique of pure desire\", which forces us to consider a dimension that goes beyond both idealisation and sublation?Metaphysics and Judeo-Christianity The positive tradition of metaphysics was grounded in a notion of the absolute and eternity that is separate, above the fray, of history and time. For the positive tradition of metaphysics, to bring the absolute and eternity into history and time, is to be allowing for an inclusion that necessarily leads to the degradation of our notion of both the absolute and eternity. This positive tradition is complicated by the theology of both Judaism and Christianity in different ways, considering that both traditions introduce a complicated social drama of eternity and the absolute that necessarily includes a relation between absolute and eternity and history and time. In Judaism the absolutely eternal seeds the possibility for its own personalisation, and in Christianity this possibility is realised in the figure of Christ, which brings us to face the absolute coincidence between eternity and historical time. How does this change philosophy? What philosophies are impossible given these theologies? How does one's theology change one's relation to philosophy?These questions will be with us throughout August. To sign up:The PortalMetaphysics ResurrectedEnter The Portal.",

What some gullible reports call \"deals\" are at best \"frameworks\" in which other countries have suggested — without signing anything — that they'll do things that might help the U.S. economy. For the most part even these understandings are vaporware. For example, the European Union literally has no way to deliver the increased U.S. investment and increased imports of U.S. energy the Trump administration has trumpeted as part of the so-called deal.What we're left with is that the United States has, for all practical purposes, unilaterally imposed high tariffs. So you should think of Trump's trade policy as the second coming of the 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariff, effectively reversing the results of 90 years of trade liberalization. In fact, average U.S. tariffs, which were very low just a few months ago, are roughly back to Smoot-Hawley levels.Unless the courts rule Trump's tariffs illegal — which they clearly are, but I fully expect the Supreme Court to uphold them anyway — Smoot-Hawley 2.0 is the new normal.How should we think about this astonishing policy reversal? Beyond the paywall I'll discuss the following issues:1. Where we now stand on tariffs, with historical context2. The likely impact of tariffs on U.S. and world trade3. The effect of tariffs on U.S. growth. Spoiler: significantly negative, but maybe not as bad as you imagine. But big costs for families.I'll follow up next week with some of the larger implications of Trump's tariffs. Crucially, what Trump is really waging is mostly a class war against middle- and lower-income Americans rather than a trade war against other countries. The hit from his tariffs to the typical family is much bigger than the hit to GDP. Also, it's important to understand that all of Trump's tariffs violate solemn agreements — agreements ratified by Congress — that the United States has made in the past. So the Trump tariffs have inflicted massive and possibly irreparable damage on U.S. credibility. Read more",

      "content": "Hi All,Its fascinating how quickly a story can drop out of the news when the drama becomes less intense and the media thinks people will pay less attention. This has certainly been the case with the big story of last week—the attempt by the Ukrainian government to undermine the independence of its anti-corruption agencies. When it was a seen as a disaster (which it was) it became a big story and was covered widely (I talked about it in the update last weekend). Then the Ukrainians as a people put such pressure on their government that Zelensky walked back the move and now those agencies are doing exactly what they should be doing (more on that below). This success, of course, meant that the media stopped talking about it as much.Phillips's Newsletter is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.While they should be talking about it more. Even as certain western voices scolded the Ukrainians for speaking up about their own future, this week showed just what Ukraine has become and what an extraordinary society it is. Not only were all the restrictions shelved by an overwhelming majority in the Ukrainian Parliament, but members of Zelensky's own party were then charged with corruption. . The Overwhelming Vote To Restore The Independence Of NABU and SAPIt is a triumph of Ukrainian society.Also, Ukrainian ranged attacks on Russian logistics, including rail capacity seem to be picking up in intensity and mass. They have done this a few times before, but never followed it up in the way one would hope. Hopefully this is actually the start of a sustained effort—but certain things need to happen. Finally, next week we have the next of Trump's deadlines passing, so maybe he will drop the hammer on Putin, or maybe not. The Triumph Of Ukrainian Civil SocietyLast weekend we had seen signs of just how powerful Ukrainian civil society has become. Crowds of people (many of them young) had come out after the government had moved to strip away the independence of Ukraine's two most important anti-corruption agencies NABU and SAP. Protests in Kyiv this weekOf course what was happening involved much more than young people protesting. There was a wide-spread sense of disgust at these moves by people across Ukraine. Some older-business types that I know were amongst the most depressed about it and were helping to put pressure on the government in the ways that they can. In other words, it was not just young protestors—it was much broader and deeper than that. For Ukrainians of all walks of life these anti-corruption agencies were a statement not only of were they are today—but where Ukraine is going. These agencies were a clear sign that Ukraine is linked to Europe, that its future is in the European Union, and that the Ukrainians are moving away from being a post-Soviet kleptocracy. Corruption has been a major problem for Ukraine since independence and Ukrainians know this. It was why this move by the government was so pernicious-it was a slap in the face to the very future for which many Ukrainians were willing to fight and die.And you know who also hates NABU and SAP? Vladimir Putin. As the Russian dictator sits atop a state that has been built on corruption (and the ability to corrupt people inside and out of Russia) he understands that Ukrainian attempts to clean up their own state and society are a huge threat to his plans to destroy Ukraine from inside (if he cant conquer it from the outside). And this week Putin singled out NABU and SAP for criticism, basically saying that they were some of the worst parts of the Ukrainian government.High praise indeed.Now, going into this week we had seen the Ukrainian government in reaction to the initial backlash say that they were going to protect the independence of NABU and SAP. However it was still not clear how this was going to be achieved and whether the move was going to be effective. By the end of the week we had answers to both of these questions—and the answers were positive.First, the original bill was overturned in a stunningly lopsided vote. (see picture at the start) There had been some worry that MPs who had voted for the original bill might feel exposed and not vote to walk back what they had just voted for. In the end, that was not the case. Of the 340 Ukrainian MPs voting on the repeal motion, 331 were in support (and the others did not oppose, just voted present). This was a clear a sign as any that the politicians of Ukraine had understood the opinion of Ukrainian civil society and that any weakening of the anti-corruption efforts was over.And what happened almost immediately after the vote—well NABU started filing anti-corruption cases reaching up to some high levels in government and society, including reportedly in Zelensky's own party. Zelensky himself said after a briefing with the head of NABU:\"A Ukrainian MP, along with heads of district and city administrations and several National Guard servicemembers, have been exposed for bribery. I am grateful to the anti-corruption agencies for their work.\"And the stories seem to be coming out in waves. Looking at a list of the most recent ten stories in Ukrainska Pravda, four of them (the ones bolded to make the point) are about corruption reports.This stunning turnaround is an extraordinary testament to the power and direction of Ukrainian civil society and its hopes for the country. In times of an existential war, it would have been understandable if many people had sat on their hands (they were being urged to by some commentators) and kept quiet rather than oppose their own government.However the Ukrainians showed that in this case opposing their own government was not only the right thing for Ukrainian politics—it was the right thing for the war effort. Ukraine is now more united and knows it has a society that is determined to have a better future. It has made Ukraine stronger.It was an extraordinary accomplishment.ShareAnd The Degradation Of OursIts amazing how Trump-defending voices tried to say it was a bad thing to attack Zelensky for what has happened—and how they completely misunderstood Ukrainian society. Niall Ferguson, wrote an extraordinary column this week which basically said that people criticizing Zelensky were weakening Ukraine. In the same way, he believes, that attacking Netanyahu weakens Israel (he tied the two together) Ferguson basically said no criticism of Zelensky will help.Not content with passing this judgment on the government of the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, they then turn their pious scrutiny to that of President Volodymyr Zelensky, accusing him of being insufficiently tough on corruption — even while western companies continue to profit from their commerce with the vastly more corrupt fascist regime of President Putin, and while the continued flow of western arms to Ukraine depends on internecine wrangles between government departments in Washington.These sentiments can be summed up together under one heading: the new defeatism. They are the moral posturing of politicians and publicists more concerned with flaunting their own confused ethics than with helping the democracies to beat the authoritarians. Its depressing as hell, though I suppose par for the course for someone who seems more than happy to excuse Trump's corruption. What the defenders of Trump and Netanyahu do not seem to want to admit is that the corruption of these governments is weakening their societies and political structures. However because Trump and Netanyahu are ensconced in power, that seems to be enough for some people to excuse what they are doing.That is not the case in Ukraine and that is to be celebrated. Not having opposed Zelensky's move would have weakened Ukraine. And now we can see why. ShareUkrainian Ranged Attacks On Russian Logistics--Can They Keep It Up?For just over the last week, the Ukrainians have started attacking a wide range of logistics targets across Russia. The range of these attacks, and their possible effectiveness give hope that the Ukrainians can finally undertake the type of campaign that they have been hinting at for years.What attacks have we seen—well a wide range. Attacks on Russian railways, particularly it seems electrical support for propulson, in the Rostov Oblast. These were followed up by more attacks in the Volgograd.Attacks on a range of Russian fuel refineries, including one in Sochi and a number of others.Attacks on different levels of Russian military production, including shahed production and preparation and electrical component manufacturing. This Kyiv Independent story gives you a good idea of the range of different industrial targets. While heartening, we need to see a few things that we have not yet seen before we can say that this could be a really effective campaign.First—will the Ukrainians keep this up. The Ukrainians have launched these kinds of attacks before, but then usually the campaigns ramp down after a while and they turn to other targets. For instance, there was what could have been a very effective campaign against Russian refineries last Spring (see below) which seemed to be doing real damage before it petered out.Why it petered out is not clear. There was some talk that Ukraine and Russia reached an unspoken understanding that the Russians would stop attacking Ukraine's power supply and the Ukrainians would stop attacking refineries—though naturally this is just rumor. It might also be that Ukraine exhausted the stocks of the weapons needed for such a campaign and had to row back.The same has happened in the past with both railway and industrial attacks. Strategic air campaigns seemed to start up against both at different times, only to quiet down. As I've said far too often, to be successful strategic air campaigns (and that is what the Ukrainians are threatening to do) need time and mass and smarts. You need the mass of equipment to keep them up for periods, the smarts to know what to attack and where, and the technical ability to actually destroy what you target.Each one of these is a challenge.The hope for Ukraine is that the Ukrainians are finally in the position to do this. Certainly their production of ranged weaponry is growing, so they might finally have the mass. And one hopes that at this point in the war, they have a good idea of Russian logistics—one detailed enough to target properly. If these first two steps are done, what we do not know is if they have the technical capacity, with their homegrown systems, to take out the targets. These require great accuracy and destructive power as well as range. You need to hit specific parts of the target with the kinetic force to destroy them (the kind of thing that Taurus and JASSM would be great at doing).Let's see.ShareThe Week Trump Drops The Hammer? Well, the latest 10 or 12 day deadline expires this coming week. On July 28, Trump spoke in dire terms of what was going to face Russia in 10 days if Putin did not make serious moves towards peace; lets say Thursday or Friday of this week.We do not know what those sanctions are or will be (they cannot be the Graham-Blumenthal bill sanctions as that bill is still not down for a vote). The day after announcing the latest deadline, Trump seemed to imply that they could be less than effective.\"I don't know if it's going to affect Russia, because he wants to, obviously, probably keep the war going,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin. \"But we're going to put on tariffs and the various things you put on. It may or may not affect them. But it could.\"We saw a version of how this might play out this week with India. At first Trump seemed to threaten India with harsh tariffs because they were supporting the Russian war effort. Then, it turns out that lots of countries were getting more tariff threats and that the actual tariff for now on India was less than that on Canada. Moreover, Trump announced that the rather Putin-sympathetic Steve Witkoff is off to Russia this week for talks with Putin. If Witkoff comes back and says Putin is keen on more talks, will that be enough to delay sanctions for longer?So what will we see? Your guess is as good as mine. Have a good rest of the weekend everyone!Thanks for reading Phillips's Newsletter! This post is public so feel free to share it.Share",

      "content": "Photo via AmazonThe U.S. economic data for the last few months is looking decidedly meh. The latest employment numbers were so bad that Trump actually fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her of manipulating the numbers to make him look bad. But there's one huge bright spot amid the gloom: an incredible AI data center building boom. AI technology is advancing fast, threatening (promising?) to upend many sectors of the economy. Nobody knows yet exactly who will profit from this boom, but one thing that's certain is that it's going to take a lot of computing power (or \"compute\", as they say). AI models take a lot of compute to train, but nowadays they also take a lot of compute to do inference — i.e., to \"think about\" and answer each question you ask. Inference compute now represents most of the cost of running advanced AI models, and increases in inference compute are responsible for many of the ongoing performance gains. So compute needs are probably only going to grow as AI keeps getting better.Whoever provides this compute is going to make a huge amount of revenue. Whether that means they'll make a lot of profit is another question, but let's table that for right now; you can't make profit if you don't make revenue. So right now, tech companies have the choice to either sit out of the boom entirely, or spend big and hope they can figure out how to make a profit. Roughly speaking, Apple is choosing the former, while the big software companies — Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon — are choosing the latter. These spending numbers are pretty incredible:Source: Chris MimsFor Microsoft and Meta, this capital expenditure is now more than a third of their total sales.Here's Chris Mims of the WSJ:The Magnificent 7 tech firms have collectively spent a record $102.5 billion on capex in their most recent quarters, nearly all from Meta, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft and Amazon. (Apple, Nvidia and Tesla together contributed a mere $6.7 billion.)...Investor and tech pundit Paul Kedrosky says that, as a percentage of gross domestic product, spending on AI infrastructure has already exceeded spending on telecom and internet infrastructure from the dot-com boom—and it's still growing. He also argues that one explanation for the U.S. economy's ongoing strength, despite tariffs, is that spending on IT infrastructure is so big that it's acting as a sort of private-sector stimulus program...Capex spending for AI contributed more to growth in the U.S. economy in the past two quarters than all of consumer spending, says Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, citing data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. [emphasis mine]Here's that chart from Kedrosky, who has been doing an excellent job following this story as it unfolds:Source: Paul KedroskySide note: I'm actually not sure Kedrosky is right about the height of the telecom boom. His chart shows the level of capex for 2020, when 5G and fiber infrastructure was being built out. But Doms (2004) shows U.S. telecom capex reaching $120 billion in 2000:Source: Doms (2004)That would have been around 1.2% of U.S. GDP at the time — about where the data center boom is now. But the data center boom is still ramping up, and there's no obvious reason to think 2025 is the peak, so Kedrosky's point still stands.I think it's important to look at the telecom boom of the 1990s rather than the one in the 2010s, because the former led to a gigantic crash. The railroad boom led to a gigantic crash too, in 1873 (before the investment peak on Kedrosky's chart). In both cases, companies built too much infrastructure, outrunning growth in demand for that infrastructure, and suffered a devastating bust as expectations reset and loans couldn't be paid back. In both cases, though, the big capex spenders weren't wrong, they were just early. Eventually, we ended up using all of those railroads and all of those telecom fibers, and much more. This has led a lot of people to speculate that big investment bubbles might actually be beneficial to the economy, since manias leave behind a surplus of cheap infrastructure that can be used to power future technological advances and new business models.But for anyone who gets caught up in the crash, the future benefits to society are of cold comfort. So a lot of people are worrying that there's going to be a crash in the AI data center industry, and thus in Big Tech in general, if AI industry revenue doesn't grow fast enough to keep up with the capex boom over the next few years.1 A data center bust would mean that Big Tech shareholders would lose a lot of money, like dot-com shareholders in 2000. It would also slow the economy directly, because Big Tech companies would stop investing. But the scariest possibility is that it would cause a financial crisis. Financial crises tend to involve bank debt. When a financial bubble and crash is mostly a fall in the value of stocks and bonds, everyone takes losses and then just sort of walks away, a bit poorer — like in 2000. Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor (2015) survey the history of bubbles and crashes, and they find that debt (also called \"credit\" and \"leverage\") is a key predictor of whether a bubble ends up hurting the real economy. They write:Using a comprehensive dataset, covering a wide range of macroeconomic and financial variables, we demonstrate that it is the interaction of asset price bubbles and credit growth that poses the gravest risk to financial stability. These results, based on long-rung historical data, offer the first sound statistical support based on large samples for the widely held view that the financial stability risks stemming from of an unleveraged equity market boom gone bust (such as the U.S. dotcom bubble) can differ substantially from a credit-financed housing boom gone bust (such as the U.S. 2000s housing market).They use the terms \"unleveraged\" and \"credit\", but what they really mean here — and the way they define their variable for credit growth — is specifically bank loans, not bonds. In the 2008 crash, most of the debt was held by banks, in one form or another. Thus, a wave of defaults threatened the solvency of the banking system, causing the entire economy to freeze up. But the banking system wasn't in any real danger of collapse from the dot-com/telecom crash, because banks hadn't lent a lot of money to people involved with the tech industry, so there weren't a lot of loans to go bad. The telecom companies had borrowed a lot, but primarily via the bond markets rather than from banks, which at the time were more focused on housing and small business. Households also didn't become significantly more indebted in the 90s (relative to their income), which is probably why there wasn't a long and painful period of household deleveraging following the dotcom boom, the way there was after 2008.So if we believe this basic story of when to be afraid of capex busts, it means that we have to care about who is lending money to these Big Tech companies to build all these data centers. That way, we can figure out whether we're worried about what happens to those lenders if Big Tech can't pay the money back. Paul Kedrosky has a list:Where is all this capital coming from?For the most part, six sources:Internal Cash Flows (Primary for Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, etc. )Debt Issuance (Rising role)Equity & Follow-on OfferingsVenture Capital / Private Equity (CoreWeave, Lambda, etc.)SPVs, Leasing, and Asset-Backed Vehicles (like Meta's recent)Cloud Consumption Commitments (mostly hyperscalers)And The Economist writes:[C]apex is growing faster than [Big Tech's] cashflows...The hot centre of the AI boom is moving from stockmarkets to debt markets...During the first half of the year investment-grade borrowing by tech firms was 70% higher than in the first six months of 2024. In April Alphabet issued bonds for the first time since 2020. Microsoft has reduced its cash pile but its finance leases—a type of debt mostly related to data centres—nearly tripled since 2023, to $46bn (a further $93bn of such liabilities are not yet on its balance-sheet). Meta is in talks to borrow around $30bn from private-credit lenders including Apollo, Brookfield and Carlyle. The market for debt securities backed by borrowing related to data centres, where liabilities are pooled and sliced up in a way similar to mortgage bonds, has grown from almost nothing in 2018 to around $50bn today...CoreWeave, an ai cloud firm, has borrowed liberally from private-credit funds and bond investors to buy chips from Nvidia. Fluidstack, another cloud-computing startup, is also borrowing heavily, using its chips as collateral. SoftBank, a Japanese firm, is financing its share of a giant partnership with Openai, the maker of ChatGPT, with debt. \"They don't actually have the money,\" wrote Elon Musk when the partnership was announced in January. After raising $5bn of debt earlier this year xAI, Mr Musk's own startup, is reportedly borrowing $12bn to buy chips.Some of these funding sources don't seem that dangerous, in the macroeconomic sense. When Big Tech or other companies spend their own cash, issues stock, or issue bonds, it looks more like the telecom boom of the 1990s than the railroad boom of the 1800s. But what about all this \"private credit\"? These are the potentially scary part. Private credit funds are basically companies that take investment, borrow money, and then lend that money out in private (i.e. opaque) markets. They're the debt version of private equity, and in recent years they've grown rapidly to become one of the U.S.' economy's major categories of debt:Source: JP MorganPrivate credit funds take some of their financing as equity, but they also borrow money. Some of this money is borrowed from banks. In 2013, only 1% of U.S. banks' total loans to non-bank financial institutions was to private equity and private credit firms; today, it's 14%. A recent note by Berrospide et al. of the Federal Reserve shows the rise in bank lending to private credit:Source: Berrospide et al. (2025)BDCs are \"Business Development Companies\", which are a type of private credit fund. If there's a bust in private credit, that's an acronym you'll be hearing a lot. And I believe the graph above does not include bank purchases of bonds (CLOs) issued by private credit companies. If private credit goes bust, those bank assets will go bust too, making banks' balance sheets weaker. A recent article by Fillat et al. of the Boston Fed argues that bank lending to private credit funds might pose a systemic risk to the banking system:The meteoric rise of private credit presents important questions about the role of banks going forward and the implications for stability in the US financial system...Our analysis of Federal Reserve and proprietary loan-level data indicates that the growth of private credit has been funded largely by bank loans and that banks have become a key source of liquidity, in the form of credit lines, for PC lenders. Banks' extensive links to the PC market could be a concern because those links indirectly expose banks to the traditionally higher risks associated with PC loans.The authors point out that most of these are very short-term loans — hence safer than long-term loans like the ones that sunk banks in the financial crisis of 2008. And most of them are senior loans — if private credit goes bust, banks get paid out first. But they caution:[B]anks would suffer losses [on their private credit lending] only in severely adverse economic conditions, such as a deep and protracted recession. But losses could also occur in a less adverse scenario if the default correlation among the loans in PC portfolios turned out to be higher than anticipated—that is, if a larger-than-expected number of PC borrowers defaulted at the same time. Such tail risk may be underappreciated.If all the private credit funds are lending to data centers, then their correlations are probably pretty high — if there's a bust in AI, a lot of them will go bust at once. This could be the \"tail risk\" that the Boston Fed folks are worried about, and it seems like there's a chance it could hurt the U.S. banking system.A private credit bust also could hurt insurance companies, who are the main LPs in the funds, but who also lend money to the funds. For example, Carlino et al. (2025) show how life insurers have basically become a kind of bank that borrows money from institutional investors and lends it to private credit:Source: Carlino et al. (2025)They note, ominously, that \"life insurers' exposure to below-investment-grade firm debt has boomed and now exceeds the industry's exposure to subprime residential mortgage-backed securities in late 2007.\"I'm not exactly sure how systemically important life insurance companies are; they're intertwined with the rest of the financial system through a number of channels, and it's hard to tell how significant those challenges are. But it seems like the possibility is there for some systemic effects. Meanwhile, other types of insurers are starting to lend to private credit as well. Remember that AIG, an insurance company, was one of the most important bailouts in the financial crisis of 2008. So when I look at this entire landscape, it seems to me that some of the basic conditions of a financial crisis are at least starting to fall into place:We have a big story about why \"this time is different\" — the idea that AI will change everything, and that data centers will thus earn huge returns.We have a large and increasing amount of debt being used to fund one single sector of the economy (data centers), meaning that the loans' default probability is probably highly correlated. We have an opaque corner of the financial system (private credit) that has recently grown from a tiny piece of the system to a very significant piece.We have systemically important lenders (banks, and possibly insurance companies) enmeshed in the new sector in a multitude of ways. So far, the danger doesn't scream \"2008\". But if you wait until 2008 to start worrying, you're going to get 2008. It's good to start worrying early. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase, is not waiting to start sounding the alarm, warning that private credit could trigger the next financial crisis, even as his own company expands into the private credit market. As a former Citibank CEO said after 2008, \"As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance.\"Subscribe nowShare1Some people also worry that the U.S. power grid won't be big and reliable enough to handle the new power demands from all these data centers. With Trump continuing his all-out attack on solar and wind energy, this is a real concern.",

His last article is on one Nick Bryant, who responded to Michael asking a simple question about his source for a sensationalist claim about human trafficking by calling him a pedophile. We also talk about Ghislaine being moved to a minimum security prison, and whether Trump has a plan regarding what to do with her. It looks like she may have worked out some kind of understanding with the administration, and in the coming weeks and months we'll be finding out exactly what the terms are.

      "content": "The media has started to pay a great deal of attention to the remote whites-only enclave in Arkansas. So far, it reportedly has 40 people living on 160 acres of land. This movement has been denounced by the attorney general of the state and the idea that it might expand into Missouri has there too been greeted with bipartisan outrage.This is kind of funny in a world where it is increasingly common in Republican circles to advocate immigration restriction on \"cultural\" grounds, on a planet full of people who are assimilating to American norms, especially when they live here for any significant length of time. One will often hear defenses of closing the border that make analogies to private property. \"Shouldn't we get to decide who lives here?\" \"How dare people in gated communities oppose the nation putting up a wall?\" There's a commentator on this Substack who tries to argue for immigration restrictionism on libertarian grounds, saying that because we have public roads, a majority vote can decide who gets to be excluded from them.These analogies have all kinds of problems. A nation is obviously not private property. If it were, then American citizens themselves would have no rights whenever they found themselves outvoted. The majority could decide that since you are in \"their\" house, they can put any conditions they want on you living there. Anyone who does anything the government doesn't approve of could be banned from public roads. Not bothering anyone.At the same time, the whites-only enclave has no such problems. It is as pure an instance of the innocent exercise of private property rights as one can imagine. People here are setting out on their own far from civilization. They build their own community only with others who have opted into it. \"Your right to swing your arms ends just where the other man's nose begins.\" Here's an instance of people going so far away there's no danger of anyone else even having to look at their arms, much less being hit by them. If liberalism means anything, it means leaving these people alone.The conservative movement, then, while justifying immigration restrictionism by an appeal to a metaphorical version of private property rights, is somewhere between ambivalent and hostile when it comes to protecting the real thing. The fact that it is \"racism\" that so horrifies them only adds to the irony. What exactly is their basis for opposing immigration? Did Republican voters all study economics and decide that the profession is wrong based on their deep understanding of the issues involved? Why do they suddenly develop an interest in income inequality when talking about this issue but no other? It's beyond obvious that racism – or perhaps some adjacent concept like nativism that similarly values people based on characteristics unrelated to character or any other form of merit – is the motivating force behind immigration restrictionism. To be fair, this isn't simply about Republicans, but really a story of the views of most human beings. Republicans are just more hypocritical, because they pretend to believe in property rights and oppose racism, though I'm under no illusions that Democratic run states wouldn't be more likely to shut down a whites-only community. The median position among all voters is surely that borders should be about as strict as they are now or stricter, and that private communities should not be allowed to discriminate based on race. This is because most people are moral imbeciles. They are not reflective enough to understand what motivates them, and will sometimes even get angry at those who, like our friends in the Ozarks, make their own hypocrisy too obvious. So Americans oppose immigration due to bigotry, and then want to burn at the stake anyone who practices honest racism.The problem with the immigration restrictionist isn't necessarily that he wants to build community. The issue is one of scale. Voters in Missouri and West Virginia try to tell New York City and San Francisco, who are welcoming towards new arrivals, that their preferences must be overruled in the name of national unity. Trump sends the National Guard to Los Angeles to fight against a community that rebels against his administration with every tool it has, supposedly because this shows that we are a nation, not an economy. The whole thing is grotesque. Meanwhile, groups like Orthodox Jews, the Amish, and Mormons live according to their principles, and there is nothing objectionable about that. People should similarly be able to organize around the concept of whiteness, however they define it, without any legal interference. The beauty of freedom is that you do not have to like, or even ever think about, what people with different values do. The search for community is not something that should be undertaken through national policy, except when necessary to defend freedom of association. The larger the polity, the more abstract the principles to hold it all together need to be, and at that level liberty must be the cornerstone of any vision that is morally acceptable and consistent with human flourishing.

      "content": "Today's links AI's pogo-stick grift: The hard part is operating in an unpredictable, adversarial, unstructured world. Hey look at this: Delights to delectate. Object permanence: Galaksija, TSA shock-wand, Reverse-centaur apocalypse. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. AI's pogo-stick grift (permalink) Not only is agentic AI bullshit, but it's a specific kind of bullshit that AI hucksters have busted out in the past, and will bust out in the future, so it's worth spending a minute to unpack this bullshit and catalog its traits so that we don't fall for it. As GW Bush says, \"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, we don't get fooled again.\" Automation can be transformative, relieving us of danger and drudgery by getting a machine to pick up some of the heavy work. Ideally automation seamlessly swaps a human for a machine at some stage in a process (ideally, the boring, dangerous and/or difficult phase). Like, whipping egg-whites for a meringue is hard on your wrist. But swap your whisk for a hand blender, and suddenly that tiresom process becomes fast and easy. If the blender is cordless, you can use it anywhere in your kitchen, including wherever you would have stood over a bowl with a whisk. A mixer, by contrast, requires more labor on your part: you have to decant the contents of your mixing bowl into the mixer, run its motor, and then scrape the whipped whites back into your bowl for the next phase. It's worse automation. But the worst automation would be a mixer that requires a special electrical outlet, a different fridge, and a special egg-carton. You would have to redesign your whole kitchen to use that thing. Sure, it might produce perfect meringues, and sure, if you had a meringue factory it might be a great solution. But for everyday use, it's a solution that creates more problems than it solves. AI pitchmen promise that seamless swapping of a human tethered to some choresome drudgery for software. That's the whole point of self-driving cars: each of us can swap a standard car for one with an autopilot and use the same roads, with the same road-users, to get to all the same places. We don't have to tear up all the roads and lay tracks, or fill the roadside environment with sensors and beacons to help the \"self-driving\" cars navigate the system. A self-driving car can share the road with human-piloted vehicles, even when those other vehicles are driven by humans who don't see why they should allow a robot to merge into their lane or have the right of way, even if the human is turning left into oncoming robo-traffic. Self-driving cars are not very good at this stuff, as it turns out. When that became apparent, self-driving car hucksters announced that it was only reasonable for their products to require something of the rest of us. As Andrew Ng put it: “I think many AV teams could handle a pogo stick user in pedestrian crosswalk,” Ng told me. “Having said that, bouncing on a pogo stick in the middle of a highway would be really dangerous.” “Rather than building AI to solve the pogo stick problem, we should partner with the government to ask people to be lawful and considerate,” he said. “Safety isn’t just about the quality of the AI technology.” https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530232/self-driving-ai-winter-full-autonomy-waymo-tesla-uber This is an incredible act of shameless bait-and-switchery. In just a few short sentences, Ng's cars go from being the kind of automation that is purely the concern of the person who uses it – the owner of a self-driving car – to the kind of automation that everyone in the world has to adjust to, lest we become part of the \"pogo stick problem.\" Making a car that can navigate a well-behaved, non-adversarial world is relatively straightforward. But demanding that the entire world behave itself? Well, that's the hard problem of 100,000 years of civilization and ethics. A product that only works in an ideal world isn't a viable product. Self-driving car boosters didn't invent this wheeze, either. The entire concept of \"pedestrian\" (and later, \"jaywalker\") was invented by the auto industry to shift blame for the death and destruction the wealthy owners of their products inflicted on everyday people to the victims: https://marker.medium.com/the-invention-of-jaywalking-afd48f994c05 The latest peddlers of pogo-stick demands are the agentic AI people. They have raised (hundreds of) billions of dollars by promising that they will make AIs that can autopilot your browser to accomplish tedious, time-consuming tasks, visiting the same websites you would visit, locating and processing the information needed to perform the task you've set for it. This will supposedly make all kinds of human workers obsolete (which is where the hundreds of billions of dollars come in – the whole AI investor pitch is \"We are developing technology that will let bosses fire their workers\"). But agentic AI sucks. Asking a chatbot to take a screenshot of a website, then make guesses about which parts of it are links and what those links do, choose one link to fire a click at, and then start again is a recipe for incredible dysfunction. That's even before we get into \"hallucinations\" (this is AI jargon for \"errors\"). A more mature agentic AI apologetics admits that while no one knows how to make an AI that can navigate the whole internet, we can make specialist agents that can perform one kind of task, then hand off the output from that task to the next agent, and the next. This also sucks: you've created a whole menagerie of AIs, each of which is prone to its own failure modes, and then combining them, multiplying all those error potentials together, sending erroneous findings careening through a cascade of downstream AIs. This is broken-telephone-as-a-service. Give it your credit card, ask it to order a bag of jucing oranges, and six months later someone's gonna back a 16 wheeler up to your front door with $40,000 worth of frozen OJ and a receipt for a futures contract you're on the hook for. The latest agentic AI pitch \"solves\" this problem by asserting that the whole internet will simply have to accommodate itself to AI agents. Every website will have to adopt robust, accurate semantics that describe its navigation and offerings, standardized across every domain of human activity. This would be great. The semantic web people have been trying to make it happen since 1999, with no success to speak of, for reasons I identified more than 20 years ago: https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm The reason websites don't make their results easy to scrape and compare is that they want to cheat you. They want you to buy something more expensive and/or inferior than the best match for your desire. There is no way for an AI agent to know when a website is lying to it, and the websites that lie the most are incentivized to have the best, highest-grade automation hooks for an AI agent to connect to (just as spammers have the best, most pristine anti-spam indicia, from DKIM to SPF to DMARC records). And these cheaters aren't fringe players – they're the biggest companies out there. Amazon knows that Prime members don't shop around, so it presents them with higher prices than non-Prime users. Airlines use AI and surveillance data to estimate your desperation and price their tickets accordingly: https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/30/efficiency-washing/#medallion-clubbed What's more, these companies sue people who try to collect and analyze their prices: https://simpleflying.com/ryanair-wins-case-booking-screen-scraping-reselling-tickets/ The hard part of comparison-shopping for an airline isn't sorting a database of all the prices offered to all customers under all circumstances: it's compiling such a database. We don't need complex AI-based techniques to perform a simple sort – we need AI to solve the problem of knowing what prices every airline is charging at this instant to every flier for every itinerary. When agentic AI grifters insist that the entire internet has to adopt and faithfully use standard APIs so their bots can accurately analyze the internet's contents, they are re-inventing the pogo-stick problem. Yes, if you could get the entire world to arrange its affairs to your benefit, you could surely do some incredible things, and if my grandmother had wheels, she'd be a rollerskate. Even if you could get everyone to adopt a standard set of APIs and use them well, this is a titanic engineering challenge, at least as big as anything the agentic AI people are promising to do.

      "content": "In this issue: we had o3 translate and summarize the recent German-language book Das Protokoll. The book provides a fresh glimpse of how protocols have evolved and proliferated over time. While this summary will surely miss details and nuance of the original version, it's been hand-edited to highlight many of the most relevant insights.In the age of Louis XIV, protocol determined whether you would kiss the king's hem or be thrown out the palace gates. A commemorative coin minted in 1661 shows the Sun King rising from his throne to greet kneeling petitioners, flanked by children, under the motto facilis ad principem aditus — \"easy access to the prince\".This image of accessibility was carefully curated. In reality, any audience with the monarch was choreographed by strict court protocol to solve the \"access to the sovereign\" problem. As citizenships ballooned in headcount under empire, rulers could not sustain the same rate of direct contact with constituents. Out of necessity, every gatekeeper, from minister to maid, fiercely regulated what impressions reached the ruler. Protocol, in other words, is a script of rules deciding who gets to do what, when, and how. It's the hidden choreography behind diplomacy, bureaucracy, and even our digital networks today.Fast forward to the 21st century, and we find protocols at the core of internet infrastructure — strange rules of cyberspace that steer how computers communicate. The concept of \"protocol\" has traveled a long way on its journey from royal courts to WiFi routers. The German-language academic volume Das Protokoll (edited by Peter Plener, Niels Werber, and Burkhardt Wolf, 2023) maps this concept's sweeping transformations. In 15 diverse essays, the book explores how protocols structure, regulate, and document interactions across diplomacy, administration, technology, literature, and religion. Why focus on protocols? Because, the volume argues, they have long been the central medium by which loose human interactions are turned into binding order — writing down and prescribing what must (and must not) be done, filtering messy reality into an authoritative record. Ultimately, protocols ensure that something gets decided.The book's four thematic sections — Prozedere & Prozess (procedure & process), Mitschriften (minutes & transcripts), Techniken (techniques), and Schreibweisen (writing modes) — each spotlight a different arena where protocol operates. Together, they show the chameleon nature of the concept. From etiquettes of power to the algorithms of a networked society, protocols are the connective tissue of order. Let's explore each in turn, to see how Das Protokoll illuminates the protocol's journey across ages and fields.Procedure & Process: Rituals of Decision and DiplomacyWhat does it take to get an audience with a king? Or a hearing in government? This section explores protocols as the rituals and processes of decision-making. Co-editor Niels Werber opens with an essay titled Protokoll, bridging the gap between old-world diplomacy and the digital age. Werber revisits Schmitt's \"access to the powerful\" problem by examining how diplomatic protocol in royal courts literally scripted who could appear before the monarch, when, and in what manner.In one striking historical case, a Swiss delegation was denied access to the French king — not due to personal offense, but because diplomacy's preferred medium was face-to-face interaction and the protocol wasn't met. As communication media evolved (telegraph, telephone, email), the rules of access shifted: personal audience gave way to protocols of communication. Werber's chapter concludes by leaping into the present with a bold thesis: the Internet Protocol (IP) itself \"re-adjusts the question of access\" and establishes new digital hierarchies and centers of power. In other words, even the open internet has gatekeepers — just as palace officials once controlled entry to the throne room.Diplomatic protocol in the classic sense also gets its due. Tobias Nanz's essay Das diplomatische Protokoll recounts the evolution of diplomatic etiquette and ceremony. We learn how formal court protocols (like the Spanish Habsburgs' elaborate Hofzeremoniell) weren't mere pomp — they were tools to manifest political order and rank. Anthropologist Anna Weichselbraun then takes us \"word for word\" into the analysis of diplomatic verbatim transcripts as historical sources, showing how even the tiniest procedural phrasing in a treaty negotiation can become critical archival evidence. Through such studies, this section highlights protocols as both process and product: the meetings and negotiations themselves, and the written records that outlive them.Interestingly, protocol can also become a site of contestation. Jonas Mirbeth's contribution looks at West Berlin's 1969 university reforms, specifically Protokoll und Protest in lectures by Klaus Heinrich. Here, we glimpse protocol colliding with politics: student protesters and a dissident professor challenging the official meeting minutes and procedures of an education reform — essentially fighting the system by arguing over its protocols. And in a leap back to imperial times, Peter Becker's essay Protokollbücher als Steuerung von Entscheidungsprozessen. Die Kabinettskanzlei und der Schreibtisch des Kaisers reveals how seemingly dry protocol books steered decision-making at the Emperor's desk. In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, for example, cabinet meeting protocols and registers at the imperial chancellery weren't passive records — they actively guided which issues reached the monarch and how decisions were formalized. Protocol, we see, is power: from grand diplomatic set-pieces to the minutiae of bureaucratic paperwork, it is the mechanism by which human authority is choreographed and decisions are inscribed.Minutes & Transcripts: The Authority of the DocumentIf you've ever been the note-taker in a meeting, you know the power (and pain) of writing the official minutes. Mitschriften, the second thematic block, delves into protocols as written transcripts — the minutes that become an institution's memory. A running theme here is how these transcripts turn into tools of truth and accountability. As one chapter title puts it, protocols can be \"für die aufmerksamen Zuhörer eine Pein, für die unaufmerksamen ein Schlafmittel\" — \"for the attentive listener a torment, for the inattentive a sleeping pill\". This wry quote (borrowed from a historical source) captures the paradox of bureaucratic minutes: painstakingly detailed records that are often painfully dull to read. Yet within that tedium lies authority.Historian Therese Garstenauer's essay examines disciplinary hearings of public servants in early 20th-century Austria, where protocol played a pivotal role in Wahrheitsfindung — finding the truth. Her findings are illuminating: \"Das Protokoll schreibt institutionell produzierte Wahrheit fest\" — the protocol writes down institutionally produced truth, guaranteed by formal procedures and by the presence of the stenographer as an eyewitness. In courts and administrative tribunals, nothing is considered real until it's in the minutes. \"Ein nichtprotokolliertes Verhör ist kein Verhör,\" she notes — an interrogation not recorded in a protocol is not an interrogation. This echoes the old Latin maxim: quod non est in actis, non est in mundo — what's not in the records is not in the world. Such is the power of the pen in bureaucracy. Garstenauer even shows how, in a 1920s case of a civil servant accused of insulting a court verdict, the painstaking compilation of protocols, witness statements, and even site inspections all served to manufacture an official truth upon which punishment could be decided. The protocol, in effect, was the truth-maker.Other contributions in Mitschriften underscore this authority of the written record. Stephan Kurz uncovers a trove of ministerial council minutes in Cisleithanian, Austria (1848–1918) — administrative-political protocols that formed the backbone of governance in a multinational empire. In these records, one can trace how policies were debated and how the empire's fate was charted on paper. Maren Lehmann's intriguingly titled piece Die Eitelkeit der Organisation (The Vanity of the Organization) considers how protocols function as \"Vor- und Mitschriften formaler Mitgliedschaft\" – pre-records and transcripts of formal membership. In clubs, committees, or even states, to be included in the protocol is to be a member, and vice versa. Her sociological lens suggests that organizations \"write themselves into existence\" by keeping minutes of their meetings — a vain exercise perhaps, but crucial for defining who's in and who's out.We also encounter a reflexive, critical note in this section. Thomas Eder's Protocol Analysis. Materialien zu einer Kritik; oder Wo bleibt das richtige Protokoll? questions whether there can ever be a \"right\" or complete protocol, compiling materials for a critique of our obsession with record-keeping. And in a thought-provoking finale, Thomas Just bluntly declares \"Das Protokoll gibt es nicht\" — there is no such thing as the protocol. By this, he points to the idea that protocol is always plural and contextual. There is no single Platonic form of protocol, only protocols embedded in specific cultures and purposes. This resonates with the entire volume's message: protocol is a shape-shifter. It can be meeting minutes, a treaty's fine print, a ceremonial code, or a computer language. In every case, though, it materializes authority — turning spoken words and social interactions into enduring, actionable scripts.Techniques: Protocols of the Machine AgeHaving examined the human side of protocols in meetings and diplomacy, Das Protokoll shifts gear — quite literally — to the technological dimension of protocols. The third section, Techniken (techniques), asks how protocols function as media and technical infrastructures. Here we move from the dusty archives to the world of code, algorithms, and information systems. Yet the continuity is striking: even in machines, protocols are about setting rules and order for interaction.Sebastian Gießmann kicks off this section by delving into the history of something seemingly prosaic: the credit report. His essay Protokollieren und Formatieren explores the media history of credit reporting. In the 19th and 20th centuries, financial institutions developed standardized forms and ledgers — essentially protocols for personal data — to record individuals' creditworthiness. The act of protokollieren (logging) and formatieren (formatting) in this context was a technique of trust: by following a set protocol (fill in these fields, use these codes), banks turned subjective judgments into objective-looking reports. Gießmann shows that even our financial lives have long been governed by protocols that decide who is \"good for it\" and who isn't.From ledgers we move to images. Media scholar Roland Meyer's chapter, pointedly titled Everything that happens to a photo, examines analogue and digital protocols of image logistics. Consider how photographs today carry metadata (timestamps, camera settings, GPS coordinates) or how digital image files undergo standardized compression, transfer, and storage. Every step follows a protocol. Meyer's essay suggests that every click of the camera and every upload leaves a trace in a larger protocol — a hidden itinerary of the image as it travels through databases and networks. The phrase \"everything that happens to a photo\" hints at a world where even creative or personal media are enmeshed in technical rules. In effect, our memories (in photos) are being administered by protocols of file formats and algorithms.Perhaps the most futuristic (and ominous) example comes from Nina Franz's contribution. Her essay Über das Protokoll hinaus (beyond the protocol) examines the quest for total control through algorithms in military and police contexts. She discusses the \"phantasm of automation\" — the fantasy that human decision-making (with all its messy contingency) could be rendered unnecessary by perfect technical protocols. Think of predictive policing systems or autonomous weapons: they aspire to protocols so complete and rigid that nothing is left to chance. Franz analyzes how realistic this vision is, and what it means when protocol-driven automation meets the unpredictable real world. The very title \"beyond the protocol\" is telling — it suggests trying to eliminate the unpredictable outside of protocol, an impulse as old as bureaucracy and as new as AI.Finally, Anna Tuschling's standout essay Offene Totalität, Internetprotokolle in der spätkapitalistischen Gesellschaft brings us squarely into the realm of the internet. Tuschling argues that to truly grasp the internet age, we must expand our notion of protocol. Technical protocols like TCP/IP — the internet protocol suite — do more than ensure an orderly exchange of data. They have become, she writes, the sine qua non of connectivity: without technical protocols, the linking of computers wouldn't just be disorderly — it would be impossible. In other words, internet protocols aren't just another step in the progression from court etiquette to phone rules; they radically widen the concept of protocol. These are rules that actively create the networked world.Tuschling builds on media theorist Alexander Galloway's famous idea that \"protocol\" is the new form of power in our era. Internet protocols hide in the background of our online lives, quietly integrating, regulating, and controlling the flow of information. They decide which devices can talk, how far messages reach, and where the bottlenecks are. In her analysis, internet protocols exhibit an \"open totality\": they strive to include an ever-expanding multitude of nodes (people, computers, devices) in one network, but not by enforcing uniformity or centralization. Instead, they achieve a kind of all-encompassing connectivity — an 'open integration' of everyone, on a technical level, into a single web. This open-ended inclusion, paradoxically, is a form of totality: the internet tends toward engulfing the whole globe, not by a top-down plan, but by the bottom-up logic of its protocols. Such total connectivity brings its own power dynamics. Tuschling notes that while early internet enthusiasts saw decentralization as liberation, the reality is that protocols themselves wield power — just in a diffuse way. They set the conditions under which communication is possible, thereby indirectly shaping social possibilities.In sum, the Techniken block paints a picture of protocol as infrastructure. Whether it's a bank's credit database, a camera's software, or the Internet backbone, protocols form an invisible scaffold holding up modern life. They are the new bureaucracy — not of paper, but of code. And as with the old bureaucracy, we must ask: who designs these protocols? What values do they encode? The book doesn't offer simple answers, but by placing technical protocols in historical context, it reminds us that even the newest technologies draw on an old desire: to bring order to chaos through rules and records.Writing Modes: Writing in the language of ProtocolIn its final section, Das Protokoll turns to the realms of literature and religion, showing that protocols are not just bureaucratic tools but also cultural narratives and writing styles. Schreibweisen means modes of writing — and here the focus is on how the protocol format itself becomes a literary or spiritual form. These essays offer some of the most surprising connections, from Jesuit spiritual exercises to Kafka's novels, underscoring that the impulse to document, list, and prescribe spans domains as lofty as faith and as lowly as paperwork.We begin on a spiritual note. Andreas Bähr introduces us to a distinctly religious kind of protocol: the \"Sünden-Protokoll\" — the sin log. In Ignatius of Loyola's 16th-century Exercitia Spiritualia (spiritual exercises), practitioners are instructed to keep meticulous charts of their sins and progress in overcoming them. Bähr's essay Punkte und Linien (points and lines) lays out Ignatius's guidelines for this sin-protocol. Imagine a penitent with a notebook, marking a point or a line for each lapse in virtue each day — literally a tally of the soul's trespasses. This was a disciplined writing practice, a form of self-examination by record-keeping. Bähr compares this Jesuit practice with later Pietist and Puritan \"Seelenprotokolle\" (soul protocols or spiritual diaries), as well as with more secular 17th-century lists of calamities and atrocities (essentially sin registers in chronicles of war). By placing these side by side, the essay asks: what makes a protocol \"religious\"?The answer seems to lie in their purpose and structure. These early modern religious protocols were \"Verzeichnisse heilsrelevanter Geschehensabläufe\" — lists of events relevant to salvation. They had a precise structure and spatial layout (columns, tables, tally marks) that reflected a belief: if you could faithfully record your moral life, you could understand and perhaps improve it. In the process, as Bähr notes, quantitative dimensions of the religious popped up — a kind of spiritual bookkeeping. The protocol format turned prayer into a ledger, repentance into a series of entries. This captivating look at Ignatius's Schreibweise shows protocol in a surprising light: as a tool for self-governance and conscience in the quest for salvation.Next, the volume pivots from the sacred to the downright infamous. Niels Penke tackles one of the most notorious \"protocols\" in history — Die Protokolle der Weisen von Zion (the protocols of the Elders of Zion). This text, fabricated in the early 20th century, purports to be the secret minutes of a meeting of Jewish leaders plotting world domination. In reality, it was a malicious hoax — fiction presented as archival truth — that fueled anti-Semitic conspiracy theories for decades. Penke's essay Fiktion, Archiv, Funktion unpacks how this forgery wielded power precisely by masquerading as a protocol. Its fictional narrative was cloaked in the form of meeting minutes, giving it an air of authenticity and bureaucratic authority (the logic being: \"if it's written like a protocol, it must be true\"). The chapter likely explores the function of this fake protocol — how it served as a political weapon — and the concept of archive — how it was treated as a discovered document in libraries and trials. This example underscores an important insight: protocols carry a built-in claim to truth. Even a false protocol can persuade if people trust the form. Penke's analysis shows the dark side of protocol's aura of authenticity — how the genre of a text (e.g. minutes with numbered points and formal tone) can be used to deceive and manipulate.From propaganda we move to literature. Co-editor Burkhardt Wolf brings the great writer Franz Kafka into the discussion. Kafka, himself a lawyer and insurance officer by day, often wrote about labyrinthine bureaucracies. But here Wolf examines Kafka not just as an author of novels like The Trial, but as a literal minute-taker (\"Mitschriften\") within bureaucracy. Wolf's essay delves into Kafka's handling of bureaucratic writing. One scenario in Kafka's writings features a police officer recording an accident report — and the act of writing the protocol becomes a spectacle of its own. Instead of the protocol being a neutral byproduct of an event, Kafka makes it the main event. In the text, the bureaucrat's attempt to record a simple incident turns into a comic, error-ridden performance — the protocol falters, the form doesn't fit the chaotic reality, and this breakdown itself becomes the drama. As Wolf observes, what should have been a \"silent transcript below the threshold of perception\" — the kind of rote administrative writing no one notices — suddenly takes center stage when it gets stuck. Kafka thus reveals the theatrical, even absurd, side of protocollary writing. The very \"schematism of the protocol\" (all those blank forms and rules) can itself produce horror and humor when confronted with life's messiness. Through Kafka, we see the protocol as a literary form: a style of writing that can be deployed artistically to critique the systems it usually serves. Finally, literary scholar Heinz Drügh wraps up the section, and the book, with Über das literarische Protokoll und seine Ästhetik (on the literary protocol and its aesthetics). Drügh's piece synthesizes many threads: how writers have adopted protocol formats (think of novels told through diaries, documents, transcripts), and what aesthetic effects this produces. From modernist experiments to contemporary art, the protocol style — its impersonal tone, its focus on details, its claim to objectivity — can be a powerful artistic device. After all, Kafka's works themselves sometimes read like bizarre committee reports or legal dossiers from an alien bureaucracy. Drügh might argue that the protocol is a genre of writing as much as a bureaucratic tool. And when authors play with that genre, they invite us to see the world with a bureaucrat's eyes — or to see the absurdity in doing so.

      "content": "There are crazy people on both the left and the right. On the left you have people who work in Universities and sometimes write papers with titles like \"the queer non-binary body's decolonial resistance politics.\" On the left you have random people with no political power on TikTok melting down over jeans ads and engaging in weird attempts to cancel people for \"microaggressions\" because they disagree with black women who criticize the tour they're running. On the right, you have RFK Junior who is skeptical of vaccines. He's the head of HHS. He thinks vaccines cause autism but isn't sure whether HIV causes AIDS. As a result of thinking these things, he slashes government funding for vaccines and HIV—decisions which will conservatively lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths. When left-wingers behave in depraved and disgusting ways, they go on TikTok and cheer for the deaths of random CEOs. This is bad, and I think they shouldn't do it. When right-wingers behave in depraved and disgusting ways, they cut PEPFAR funding for poor children with AIDS—a decision that will likely kill millions of people. Then they dismantle most of the rest of foreign aid for good measure, leaving poor orphans in distant lands without access to food or medicine, so that they die in their beds from HIV and tuberculosis. Occasionally left-wingers deny elections. This usually amounts to harumphing about Russian interference and overestimating its effects. A few random people on social media denied the 2024 election. When this happened, MSNBC reported on this trend disapprovingly. Certainly no major Democrat figure would dream of endorsing this election theory. The right-wingers who deny elections aren't just random people on the internet. The sitting president denied the 2020 election after he lost. Then he launched a several-month-long coup attempt, where he employed crackpot lunatic lawyers to push insane theories like that the vice president gets to unilaterally overturn elections if he doesn't like the results. He tried to get fake slates of electors to crown him president after losing the election, and his plot was only foiled by Mike Pence, for the first time in his career, showing that he had a backbone, and was not a great supine protoplasmic invertebrate jelly. And no, the way that Hillary Clinton \"denied\" the election is not remotely comparable to the way that Trump did. Hillary conceded the election the next day. While she occasionally complains about Russian interference, she did not send a mob to the capital to screw with the peaceful transfer of power, and then sit around for hours drinking a diet coke while her insane supporters stormed. She never tried to orchestrate a fake elector scheme to declare herself president. Democrats did not usher in a reign of terror wherein the government yanks every brown-looking immigrant off the streets and chucks them into an El Salvadoran torture dungeon. Democrats did not have a program named after an internet meme dedicated to schizophrenically axing government programs that sound woke two seconds after you hear about them. Democrats did not have the DHS Twitter account openly posting thinly-veiled Nazi dogwhistles (and note: I don't just automatically accuse my political opponents of dog-whistling. I don't think the Elon salute was a dog-whistle)! There are people on the left who are as crazy as Donald Trump. There are Tankies who pine for the Soviet Union and write lengthy screeds about the virtues of Mao. But these people aren't the president! They're not the heads of the Democratic party. The Democratic party doesn't have to capitulate to the will of Tankies, the way the Republicans have to capitulate to the will of Trump. The most insane thing left-wingers have come to believe in the last few years is that the police should be abolished. It was mostly younger people on social media who thought that; none of the party's thought leaders did. The police were not abolished in any place. And while in some places, police funding was cut in a way that was bad, this is well within the zone of fairly normal politics. Both sides enact bad policies sometimes. But the Republicans do have a monopoly on batshit insanity at the electoral level. There is not one elected Democrat anywhere near as crazy as RFK Junior or Trump. There is not one elected Democrat who attempted a coup, or attempted to eliminate all foreign aid. There is not a single high-profile Democrat who denies the effectiveness of vaccines.The best thing that Trump did during his first-term was warp sped through a vaccine that saved large numbers of lives. But because his party was even crazier than he was, he spent his next four years disavowing that accomplishment. The worst thing he did in his first term was attempt a coup. And for four years, high-level Republicans had to pretend that the 2020 election was rigged to avoid angering Trump. Even Trump's 2024 political opponents rarely went as far as forcefully denying that the 2020 election was rigged. They simply could not admit that they lived in reality for fear of losing half their voters. There's a realm of legitimate disagreements about politics: about how high taxes should be and what role America should play in foreign policy. But you simply can't have a reasonable policy discussion with a person who isn't sure if viruses exist. As has been pointing out for years, the Republican party has been fully taken over by crackpots and lunatics who care about the truth about as much as raccoons care about private property. People sometimes ask me: how do I, someone who frequently calls out left-wing insanity, remain a Democrat? How do I complain about wokeness, and then vote for the woke party? Now part of the answer is that when the left has bad ideas, they rarely kill millions of people. The same can't be said about a Republican party that has gutted most of foreign aid. But the thrust of the answer is that though the left has lots of crazy people, the modern Republican party has crazy people at the highest levels. RFK Junior isn't a random TikToker—he's head of HHS! Donald Trump isn't a low-level Republican staffer—he's the president. It is perfectly reasonable to join a political coalition that has some crazy people. But when the coalition is nothing but crazy people, when it has active disdain for anyone who isn't crazy, who doesn't doubt that vaccines work, who lives anywhere remotely in the vicinity of reality, then nothing much can be done about that. You can vote for a party with some crazy people, but you cannot vote for a party that is nothing but crazy people. When nutjobs are fringe, that is one thing. But when they are the party, when there is no party apart from the nutjobs, that is a very different matter. There are real crazy people on the political left, but they are nothing at all like the crazy people on the right. For they are not in the highest levels of government. The Republican party differs from the Democratic party in that it has, up to the top leadership, wholly and completely absconded from reality, or anywhere else within a 1,000 mile radius.",

      "content": "Many modern stories you know well are in fact far older than you think. In the case of Mario Puzo's The Godfather, there's an underlying narrative that has been told by humans for thousands of years. That's because The Godfather is really an Ancient Greek tragedy.In ancient Athens, the amphitheaters that played host to such tragedies were not merely there for entertainment, but as an essential pillar of ancient life. For the Greeks, the public performance of tragedy played a critical role in fostering the civic virtue of all audience members — indeed, attending the theater was essential to your formation as an individual, and part of your civic duty.But when you think of wholesome, character-building movies, odds are you don't think of ones about the Italian mafia. From drug dealing to mayhem and murder, these films depict the dark underworlds that exist far outside the realm of polite society.Yet The Godfather stands out from the rest as a fundamentally moral story. Despite the violence they depict onscreen, the three films that constitute the trilogy offer a haunting meditation on power, fate, and the moral cost of ambition. Because even though they were filmed in the latter half of the 20th century, they tell a story as old as time.The saga of Michael Corleone's rise and fall in The Godfather is a Greek tragedy for the modern age, a cautionary tale designed to warn you about what happens when you compromise on your values and ignore what matters most in life.Today, we explore it in depth to discover what it reveals about how — and how not — to live a life that's truly meaningful...Reminder: this is a teaser of our members-only deep dives.To support our mission and get our premium content every week, upgrade for a few dollars per month. You'll get:Full-length, deep-dive articles every weekendThe entire archive of great literature, art, and philosophy breakdownsMembers-only podcasts and exclusive interviewsSubscribe nowPart 1: Loss of Innocence & Rise to PowerThe tragedy of The Godfather begins with a joy-filled celebration: Don Vito Corleone's only daughter, Connie, is getting married. In attendance is her brother Michael, who, having eschewed the family business in favor of more wholesome pursuits, has since attended Ivy League university and become a decorated war hero.Michael is considered a \"noncombatant\" even by enemies of the Corleone family, and is respected for his integrity in having rejected the life of crime. But when a rival family nearly kills his father, everything begins to change — and it's where the first markings of Greek tragedy become readily apparent.Aristotle defined tragedy as the fall of a great man through a combination of hamartia (tragic flaw), peripeteia (reversal of fortune), and anagnorisis (recognition or self-awareness). Michael's hamartia is that he believes he can still preserve his integrity while stepping into a corrupt system, and this leads him to help his family in avenging their father.As the film progresses, Michael leans into his new role with increasing success — but what sin loans freely in the present, it comes to collect with interest in the future. By the end of the film, Michael has seen his bride Apollonia murdered before his eyes, and has himself killed at least nine people, including his sister Connie's husband.Nevertheless, the first Godfather film still ends on a triumphant note, with Michael putting a conclusive end to the war between families and consolidating his power. But even here, all is not well. In a scene reminiscent of Genesis, Michael's loss of innocence is highlighted in a conversation with his new wife, Kay. Whereas Michael used to share freely with Kay about his family — \"That's my family, Kay. It's not me\" — he now hides his dealings from her, demanding she never ask him about his business. Just as Adam and Eve become ashamed of their nakedness after they taste the forbidden fruit, so too does Michael now conceal his dealings from his loved ones.But what's worse is that a larger-scale tragedy is being set up, one which will only see its conclusion in the third and final \"act\" of the trilogy. It's foreshadowed with the death of Don Vito, who finally passes away one day after playing with his grandson in the family garden. Upon his death, he has all a man could ever want — wealth and power, yes, but even more importantly a beautiful and loving family who truly care for him.As we will see, it's a reality that couldn't be in any starker contrast to how Michael will end his days...Part 2: Descent into DamnationWidely regarded as one of the best sequels to ever be made, Godfather II uses parallel story-lines to recount both the origins and making of Don Vito, and the slow unraveling of his son.Michael's plot line begins with his decision to move the family out of New York, to Nevada. Desiring to put the legacy of violence and crime behind him, he aims to legitimize the family business by buying up casinos. But as he soon discovers, sin does not let you out of its grip so easily — much like the casinos Michael owns, evil makes it incredibly easy to sit down at the table and begin gambling. But when you want to cash out and leave, it's a whole different story.The irony is that in his quest to leave the world of crime behind him, Michael is forced to sin even further. Extortion, murder, and betrayal ensue as he undergoes the painful peripeteia (reversal of fortune) of Greek tragedy — yet in his case, the reversal takes place not in a single moment, but in the gradual unraveling of everything he holds dear.Contrasting this breakdown, however, is the rise of Don Vito, now portrayed as a young man trying to make a name for himself in early 1900s New York. The film shows how he came to be \"the Godfather\", and although certain aspects of his journey entail overt criminal activity, the overall portrayal of his rise is more sympathetic and wholesome. Specifically, you're made aware that much of what he created was designed so that his children would never have to follow in his footsteps. It makes his lines to Michael in the first film even more poignant and heartbreaking: \"I never wanted this for you.\"But where Vito sacrificed the integrity of his actions to serve his family, Michael sacrifices his family for the integrity of his actions. Because although he claims to do what he does to protect his loved ones, the actions he takes only serve to alienate and push them away. His relationship with his Kay erodes to the point at which she aborts their child solely to spite him, and the film ends with Michael doing the unthinkable — ordering the execution of his brother.The irony is that, in executing his brother for \"taking sides against the family\", Michael has done the exact same thing. But even here, the tragedy of The Godfather has yet to reach its painful nadir, as its main lesson isn't revealed until the third film.With elements of Greek, Shakespearean, and Biblical drama coming together in a poignant final act, The Godfather Part III reveals how men bring their life to ruin by losing sight of what matters most — and crucially, how you can avoid that very fate...

Until a few years ago I \"never\" thought my partner and I would end up installing a Gro-Pad in front of our open window in the early springtime, when the Zephyr begins to blow in from the East, hoping to trap a little one to call our own. Yet there we were, both our biological clocks run down, more or less stuck with this small strip of gauze, like the absorbent pad in a package of fresh fish that soaks up excess fluids and that always somehow makes me lose my appetite, as the lone remaining method if we wished to start a family. I mean I understand the controversy. Many still maintain the spores that land on these peculiar-smelling rectangular mats aren't really human at all, and that whatever subsequently grows there is only some sort of counterfeit homunculus. But some of us don't have the luxury of dwelling on such metaphysical riddles. There are by now thousands of beings walking among us who began their earthly lives, or at least their most recent earthly lives, on just such Gro-Pads as ours, and for all anyone can tell they walk just as human beings do, and talk just as human beings do. And that's enough, at least for my own pragmatic sensibility, to deem them human. This is to say, now that we've been through the process, that I think on balance it's worth it. Not that we've had it easy. In fact things were tough for us right from the get-go, starting with an unusually gruesome mishap just a few weeks into our efforts, when, I confess, I absent-mindedly dropped a new replacement strip onto the carpet, only for Sam to find in that same spot, a few days later, a horrible mass of miniature human organs with no rational organic connection between them and no prospect for survival, like some grotesque Empedoclean abortion from the dawn of time.1 We were under no strict obligation to dispose of these remains with the ritual solemnity commonly accorded to legal and moral persons. But they were human remains, or something like it, or so we believed, and believe still. And in any case professional carpet-cleaners have by now adopted a blanket policy against dealing with this sort of mess. So we had our private funeral, Sam and I, in the backyard, for our little carpet-growth — our squandered human-spore.Get 25% off for 1 year Read more",

      "content": "[This article has a 3/10 Woo Rating].If the purpose of our existence is the evolution of our consciousness, then maps of human development are pretty important. Whether you like it or not, these models probably apply to you. So it's best to know where you might be and what might be coming next. There are lots of amazing articles1 describing developmental maps and the specific stages themselves, so this one will be more about why the maps themselves are important. I believe the most valuable commonality is that they don't just imply a direction to the evolution of consciousness, they try to describe what that process looks like on the societal and individual level. That probably sounds obvious, but how many people in your daily life do you feel are deliberately working on the evolution of their own consciousness? And how many have an accurate sense of their own relative trajectory? The most influential and credible maps share a broad agreement of what that process looks like. One of the more robust models is Spiral Dynamics. I interviewed Peter Merry, an author, Co-founder of Ubiquity University and Wyrd Technologies and an expert in Spiral Dynamics. He gave us a relatively quick guide to developmental frameworks and then a deeper discussion of where we are now, as well as what this moment's new kind of emergent leadership might look like. [Listen on Spotify or Apple Podcasts]. As a quick recap for people unfamiliar with the spiral dynamics map, these are the basic stages: Beige: Focused purely on survival, driven by instincts and basic needs like food, warmth, and safety.Purple: Tribal and magical, seeking safety in groups and rituals, guided by spirits, elders, and ancestral ways.Red: Egocentric and power-driven, asserting dominance and immediate gratification through strength and force.Blue: Orderly and rule-bound, often rooted in religion or authority.Orange: Rational, strategic, and success-oriented, valuing achievement, science, and personal advancement.Green: Focused on inclusion, empathy, and harmony with others and nature. Postmodern and relativist.Yellow: Integrative and flexible, able to see multiple systems and truths.Turquoise: Holistic and cosmic, sensing unity of all life, embodying global consciousness and the flow of evolution itself.Peter has a helpful framework for how each stage might respond to a new idea.The more our basic needs are met, the more freedom we have to see the world in subtle and nuanced ways.2 One way this manifests is in the complexity of our perspectives. And an easy way to test ourselves is to consider our own emotional triggers. These can be people in our daily lives, or polarizing public figures like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, Vladimir Putin or Hilary Clinton. A less integrated view tends to place people and topics in binary \"good\" or \"bad\" categories, more integrated levels see room for complex motivations and common human flaws.And yet: if you then find yourself looking down on other people who think in less nuanced terms, that's also a symptom of an earlier stage. This is because seeing the stages as a hierarchy to climb is typical of the achievement-based stages. Instead, they are a holarchy, which is why a better way to envisage them is as a rainbow onion. The inner color layers are the more basic needs. You cannot skip a stage and you make progress by transcending and including the prior levels. Your circumstances can also push you back down a stage. We are all only a few missed meals or bad nights' sleep from dropping down to more basic survival concerns. This stages perspective can also help you to be more compassionate about your own \"college atheist,\" \"over-achiever,\" or \"spiritual bypasser\" phases. Source: Veo 3 AI Image Generation. Cool right?One very helpful guiding principle taken from these maps is to look back at the trajectory of your own life as a holarchy. Your educational and professional experience can provide increasingly sophisticated skillsets. These are then ideally transcended and included in an integrated way in service of emergence. What's funny is that this process is usually only obvious looking backwards. The disciplined structure of school and college taught me basic reading, writing and analytical skills (Blue order stage). On Wall Street I learned how to spot key insights and communicate them rapidly (Orange ambition stage). In the decade that followed I became interested in more holistic topics (Green). Then I started to see wider systemic patterns and tried to align my life around them. Now I strive to integrate all of these skills to run a community and produce content around what brings me alive. [I'm obviously implying I'm Yellow or Turquoise, but that also obeys the first law of stage theory: people who enjoy these kinds of maps always seem to think they are further along than they actually are].Arguably the most important perspective you attain at the more integrated levels is that you recognise the force that is driving the process itself and find ways to align with it. Although the framing definitely has a hierarchical tone, Ken Wilber's Integral Theory makes a distinction between Tier 1 and Tier 2 thinkers.3 Tier 2 begins with the Yellow level and it's the first perspective that understands all the previous ones as valid steps in development, then transcends them. The shift from Tier 1 to Tier 2 is a profound phase transition in your worldview. At Tier 2 you not only understand what's making the onion grow, you can begin to work with that force. Donella Meadows called this \"dancing with systems.\" Or, as Integral Theory's Ken Wilber puts it: \"Spirit is both the highest \"level\" in the holarchy, but it's also the paper on which the entire holarchy is written. It's the highest rung in the ladder, but it's also the wood out of which the entire ladder is made.\"There are signs that this shift may be emerging in society as we speak.Is \"THE SHIFT\" Actually Happening?If everything is progressing towards complexity, it makes sense that our cultures and societies are subject to the same forces. As Peter notes, the journey each human goes on in the course of their individual life mirrors the same journey humanity has been on for hundreds of thousands of years. If the stage we can reach is partially determined by our environment, more of us should now have the potential to reach later stages. Most of you reading this have access to a level of resources and information that was unthinkable even a few decades ago. High quality soil means more onions can grow faster. And, as Peter noted in our conversation, a change in our environment doesn't just make new stages possible for us, an increase in the complexity of our situation often requires a new stage in order to operate successfully in the world. How would a caveman handle holding down a job and raising a family in Manhattan? As the world has exponentially increased in complexity over the past few years, the evolutionary demands on our consciousness have increased accordingly. Whether it's Blue's dogmatic religion/monarchy, Orange's scientific materialism/capitalist individualism or Green's postmodernism/relativism, all of the previous control systems and explanatory models are failing. This is because they cannot hold the complexity required of our current circumstances. But thanks to these stages models, we can guess what's coming next: a deeper understanding of intelligent forces that transcend and include every stage we've had before. However, it's a very common feature of people who have had sudden spiritual or psychedelic experiences to assume we are on the verge of a global shift in consciousness.4 There's even a word for it: \"eschatothesia.\" Specifically, we are currently seeing newly-spiritual finance and tech professionals use their elite pattern recognition skills to produce evidence that we are on the cusp of a global awakening. Confirmation bias is a helluva drug. Transformational coach and Integral Theory expert Devin Martin gave a short, insightful and amusing talk at the Leading Edge Summit. He poked fun at the sheer volume of newly-spiritual executives he encounters who are experiencing eschatothesia (especially me). However, he agrees that there is definitely something unfolding. He sees the current global distribution as relatively concentrated in the order and ambition stages, but with a very small number of people now emerging around the later levels. Even more interestingly, he notes that we seem to be moving into the integrated stages at an ever-accelerating rate.Timeframes accelerate as you approach tipping points, and there are a whole range of theories floating around offering percentage thresholds for when a global shift in consciousness might occur.5 I have argued that this paradigm shift will be marked by the realization that, not only is consciousness primary, it has an evolutionary direction. Once again: you not only understand what's making all of the onions grow, you can begin to work in alignment with the direction of that force.I've long wondered how we'd know if this wider shift in perception was actually happening. So I consulted with neuroscientist and author on the science of spirituality . I asked her for a definition of what it might look like. She believes that this shift could take many forms in society, but one possible expression is a growing acceptance that mystical, anomalous, paranormal, or spiritual experiences are real and should be taken seriously.How might these phenomena be relevant to stage theory? One example would be Near Death Experiences (NDEs), which consistently produce a sense of your consciousness no longer being bound to your physical form. It also explains why Out of Body Experiences (OBEs) have been central to shamanic and mystery school initiations for thousands of years.6 Suddenly you're above the whole garden looking down at the onions. The immense benefit of exploring a mystical worldview is that it makes us receptive to the kind of intelligent forces we encounter at the more integrated levels of consciousness. This is analogous to the shift in perspective to Tier 2 where you no longer solely identify with the stages themselves, but also the force that's driving our growth through them. It's easy to see how this transition to Tier 2 can come with a loss of interest in careers and topics that dominate the less integrated tiers. Moreover, an existential crisis is pretty likely as we increasingly disidentify with the \"Tier 1\" egoic and societal structures that we're now transcending. If Devin's chart is accurate about the tiny global distribution of the more integrated stages, there also won't be many other people around you that share these emerging interests, which can be lonely and disorienting. And yet, to be increasingly dissatisfied with life at the \"ambition\" stages isn't a lack of gratitude for material abundance, it's heeding the call of evolution. According to many of these models, the more you've reached a stage of material sufficiency, the more open you might be to subtle evolutionary signals. The alternative to swimming with the current is drowning or stagnation. Anecdotally, this shift in perception is definitely happening within my personal orbit, and even on Wall Street. And while it's obviously subject to the same forces of confirmation bias, Peter Merry and I agree that the mainstreaming of spiritual practices, psychedelics, psi phenomena and post-materialist scientific theories provides a broader supporting case.7 But empirical data on this has been much harder to come by and I've yet to see anything vaguely compelling in either direction.8 The key question for individuals in the context of these transitions is: what do you do at the later levels. One answer that seems to consistently produce emergent flourishing is to work with the force that's growing the onions. Leader as GardenerA common rebuttal to claims that \"the shift\" is happening is that certain Western democracies seem to be slipping back into less integrated political landscapes. But even if the tide isn't rising for all, individuals still definitely have increasing agency to embrace the more integrated forms of consciousness and leadership.As Peter describes, Yellow leaders can still get stuck looking to engineer big systemic solutions to massively complex problems. Instead, Turquoise looks to become so present in the moment it makes wise single steps in harmony with the system. This requires cultivating an embodied sense for the energy of the system you're in. The force that's growing the onions is fundamentally subtle. It's why you can only detect them at higher levels of integration, likely when your other basic needs have been met. Leaders make space for that force to emerge and cultivate that sensitivity in others by making them feel safe. This extends the walled garden analogy. These intimate containers and communities can provide superior conditions specifically for the evolution of consciousness. Unlike the more overt earlier stages, this kind of leadership doesn't develop more control structures, as a gardener it facilitates the subtle conditions for emergence. This can be as simple as ringfencing a business unit, running a conscious community or working 1:1 on personal development. Over the last 18 months at The Leading Edge we've been slowly building a resource base for this new generation of leaders. We have been innovating on a template for World Wise Web communities for high-agency people. has helped us identify the most likely ways these communities fail while outlining frameworks for success as both individual coaches and authentic leaders. As Peter repeatedly emphasizes, gardener leaders are attuned to the subtle energy of the system they are a part of. The most efficient description of this sensititivity is \"wisdom.\" I spent all of 2024 researching a series on accelerating the evolution of your consciousness. We emerged with 11 key practices and tools. I have subsequently spoken to multiple experts on how to harmonize with evolutionary intelligence, build a meditation practice and cultivate embodiment, intuition and subtle presence.Money, and perceptions about money, remain the overwhelming obstacle to the evolution of consciousness. So we have covered the integration of money both personally and systemically. We are also dedicated to exploring how we evolve beyond \"Orange Capitalism\" to \"Turquoise Sageism\" in practical ways.The metaphor Peter likes to use is that, when a caterpillar is becoming a butterfly, new \"imaginal cells\" emerge. These are initially attacked by the old system, but when they first connect to each other and then persist, the old form dissolves and fuels the new. The butterfly must then struggle against the walls of the cocoon until it eventually has sufficient strength to survive on its own. The new generation of leaders will build these spaces. [Listen to my conversation with Peter Merry on Spotify or Apple Podcasts]. Share1I'd especially recommend: 's The Map of Our Future \"I've now decided that Tara Springett is my favorite recommended teacher for anyone seeking a path to higher consciousness. Her blue book changed my life and as I've revisited her many other books I've come to conclude she has simultaneously provided both 1) the most comprehensive teachings and 2) the most practical applications of anyone I've encountered. Yes, there are other mystics with far greater abilities or more captivating stories, but no one makes it as consistently accessible and practical as Tara.\"Kyle Kowalski has written a comprehensive summary of Ego Development Theory. wrote a great piece on his own personal progession through the stages, although we'd differ a little on what Stage 7 looks like. 2As I explored in Fear, Fortune and the Fog of War, a safer environment might literally change what we are able to perceive. It's a wild idea. Moreover, if consciousness were getting increasingly subtle, we might also expect to see a spike in the sensitivity exhibited by younger generations. This might be reflected in rises in neurodiversity. As recently discussed in Evolution and Psychiatry, Neuroscientist Dr. Anne-Laure Le Cunff has developed a \"Hypercuriosity Theory of ADHD.\" More freedom translates to a high exploratory instinct and sensitivity to novel topics. A draw to pursue unique niches appropriate to our gifts. But in an outdated system optimised for a small number of careers and low-level of neurodiversity, this can just look like high distractibility and impulsivity.3Mark Manson wrote a stinging critique of how Ken Wilber's Integral Movement got corrupted by falling back into hierarchical thinking. 4There's also the \"states and stages\" problem. It's possible to experience fleeting transcendent nondual states at a less integrated level of development. You might then interpret the experience at that level of development; for example, someone at the egoic ambition Orange stage might be at risk of assuming they are personally the messiah. There's a big difference between have a Tier 2 \"state\" peak experience of transcending the ego and actually living from that place as a \"stage.\" 5I'd recommend one of the best podcasts of the year so far with Martha Beck and on this topic. Also his article What's Actually Happening With The Consciousness Shift on the Planet?6Check out my recent piece on the mystical history of Portugal and my interview with Freddy Silva. Appropriately, my last guest Emily Lane had an NDE after drowning in Ecuador that was the gateway to a gradual awakening process over two decades. Funnily enough, Peter also agrees with the general need for us to reunite with the divine feminine, something he described in his viral article Volution – the Pain and the Promise.7I've recently been down an enjoyable rabbit hole with Federico Faggin's theory of Quantum Information Panpsychism. I don't understand it all, but it seems approximate to the kind of theory that transcends materialism. 8There's a pretty decent YouGov poll showing how surprisingly prevalent \"New Age\" beliefs are among Americans, but it isn't offered as a time series.",

Each of these is uploaded in three different platforms: as YouTube shorts, Facebook reels, and LinkedIn videos.At present, I'm midway through teaching an 8-week online class on Stoicism and the cardinal virtues, and I have also started preliminary work on what will be a book-length project on the topic as well. So I thought that it might be useful or interesting to others for me to discuss some of these matters of Stoic virtue ethics I and my students are working through, set into this short video format.Stoicism sometimes gets wrongly summed up as a philosophy of life that maintains that \"virtue is the only good\". Reading across the Stoic literature we have, you will find a few statements like that, but many more discussing other things that Stoics considered good. Virtue is certainly a primary good, however, one that the other goods are in one way or another connected with. So that then leads to the question: What is virtue?Or better put: What are the virtues? Notice the plural. In nearly every virtue ethics out there, a set of good character traits, needed for human happiness or proper human development and flourishing, are identified. The Stoics have a similar list to a number of other schools or traditions of philosophy in antiquity, recognizing four \"cardinal\" virtues: wisdom (or prudence), justice, courage, and temperance (or moderation).That list of four main virtues is a good start, but unfortunately, it is where a lot of the contemporary \"Stoic\" writers, bloggers, podcasters, video producers, coaches, and speakers leave off. As it turns out, the ancient Stoics identified and discussed a number of subordinate virtues for each of these cardinal virtues. And that is where the real \"meat\" of Stoic virtue ethics is to be found, in those more particular virtuous dispositions falling under prudence, justice, courage, and temperance.Eventually I'll produce a much larger set of these short videos delving into these topics, both at a level of higher generality and going into the depths of detail. For the present, however, these are what I have to offer.

      "content": "Goddess of Kannon statue, Japan, via @sci_fi_infra.Welcome to the reading list, a weekly roundup of news and links related to buildings, infrastructure, and industrial technology. This week we look at European multifamily construction, a robot lamp, China's self-driving car test, a \"mini Moravec's paradox\", and more. Roughly 2/3rds of the reading list is paywalled, so for full access become a paid subscriber.No essay this week, but I'm working on a more involved piece about the nature of technological progress that should be out next week.Housing monopoliesA line of argument I haven't been paying much attention to but has (apparently) been gaining traction is the idea that recent increases in housing costs are driven by monopolies in homebuilding. This theory has been advanced by folks like Matt Stoller, but evidently it's gaining currency with others as well.This theory didn't seem completely crazy to me, as over the past several years homebuilding has steadily gotten more concentrated. It used to be that the 10 largest homebuilders were responsible for a very small fraction of total homes built in the US, but today they're responsible for an increasingly large share. But I had never really looked into the idea.However, a good piece by Derek Thompson on his substack lets some air out of this theory:It is a fact that home prices across the country have increased in the last decade. It is also a fact that homebuilders have gotten bigger in the last few years. The question at stake here is: Is the second fact causing the first fact?I believe there is only one economic paper that unambiguously says yes. It is a 2023 working paper entitled \"Fewer players, fewer homes: concentration and the new dynamics of housing supply\" by the economist Luis Quintero. This research is load-bearing in the antitrust world. It's quoted in articles and social media posts by the antitrust advocate Matt Stoller. You'll find it in research from other antitrust scholars. And it seems to be the only empirical research in Musharbash's essay.I called Luis Quintero to ask what level of market concentration in homebuilding he considered to be dangerous. In the most concentrated markets, Quintero said, one or two firms account for 90 percent of new housing. But problems begin to accelerate, he said, if five or six firms account for 90 percent of new housing....I tracked down a complete listing of the country's 50 largest homebuilding markets, from #1 Dallas to #50 Cincinnati. How many meet Quintero's first oligopoly threshold (two companies = 90 percent of the market)? Zero out of 50. And how many meet his second threshold (six companies = 90 percent of the market)? One: Cincinnati. It turns out that the largest homebuilding markets just aren't that concentrated, even when you accept the yardstick of the economist who's offered the only empirical definition of market concentration in homebuilding that I can find.European multifamily constructionIt's become clear that for many types of construction, European countries have much lower construction costs than the US does. Transit and subway construction is the most famous example of this, but it's my sense that in multifamily apartment construction, Europe is also often substantially cheaper.With transit construction, some of this comes down to improved efficiency and lower labor costs, but some of it comes down to differences in what gets built: US transit apparently often has much larger, more expensive stations than European transit. It seems like something similar might be true for multifamily construction as well. On Twitter, developer Brendan Whitsitt looks at a recent multifamily project in Paris, and lays out the many differences which allow it to be built for less than a similar project in Canada (which I believe will be fairly similar to US requirements.)Robot lampI've spent a bit of time discussing humanoid robots, and considering whether a humanoid form factor will win out, or if other robot form factors might make more sense. In that vein, here's a company developing a robotic floor lamp, Lume, that will (supposedly) autonomously fold clothes for you when it's released in 2026:It's not clear how close they are to an actual working robot (the video is entirely simulated, and I'd be surprised if they end up using a form factor that has so many joints/degrees of freedom), but if this seems compelling, you can place a reservation for the lamp here.Elon Musk's self driving car predictionsTesla has been working on self-driving cars since at least 2013, and has been shipping Autopilot hardware since at least 2014. Over the years, Elon Musk has frequently made predictions about when various self-driving capabilities will be available, which have reliably proved to be overly optimistic. Wikipedia has a helpful list of every prediction Elon Musk has made around self-driving cars, and the status of that prediction.The list includes 29 predictions in total. Of these, 1 has been met, 3 have been partially met, 7 might still be met but haven't yet, and 18 haven't been met. Read more",

      "content": "As I wrote some seven ago in The American Interest, the integrity of government statistics is one of the essential foundations of democratic modernity. Systematically collected and disseminated government data — on inflation, employment, trade, demographics, weather, crime, pollution, traffic, poverty, disease, vaccination rates, etc. — provides the epistemic foundation on which citizens can scale their local experiences into a shared sense of national reality. Without this statistical scaffolding, politics collapses into pure narrative contestation, where truth is whatever serves the factional purpose of the moment. In liberal democracies, this trust in neutral data is not an incidental feature; it is a core political virtue, one that separates deliberation from demagoguery. Conversely, from the point of view of a would-be dictator, this trust represents a grave threat to their ability to dictate \"reality\" by fiat.This is why Trump's firing yesterday of Erika McEntarfer, Commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), strikes me as such a grave if sadly predictable development. The official justification, such as it is, followed the release of a weak July jobs report, which recorded just 73,000 new positions and downward revisions to previous months — just as most reality-based economists had anticipated would be the result of Trump's chaotic, uncertainty-inducing economic policies. President Trump, seizing upon these figures, accused the BLS of intentionally \"rigging the numbers\" to make him and his administration \"look bad.\" Within hours, McEntarfer was out — fired not for any wrongdoing, but for overseeing the production of politically inconvenient arithmetic.Some may be tempted to dismiss the firing of McEntarfer as just another Trumpian tantrum, but to do so would be to miss the structural significance of the act. This was not simply about one jobs report. It was a direct assault on the credibility of the institutional machinery that sustains shared reality in American public life. Public statistics are the foundation of public integrity. The BLS has long been viewed, by left and right alike, as an island of technocratic impartiality, one that month in and month out surveyed households to determine unemployment rates, businesses to determine job growth, and prices to determine inflation — in other words, to provide the most basic facts around which policy debate in a rational-legal system of governance is supposed to revolve. To punish it for statistical honesty sends the message that data itself is now fair game, at least for MAGA, in the partisan war over perception.Insofar as there is not a hue and cry about the firing of McEntarfer, it represents the normalization of what might be called \"epistemic authoritarianism\" — that is, a shift away from the norm of disinterested statistical collection and toward a regime where numbers are evaluated not by their accuracy, but by their political utility (to MAGA). In autocracies, the manipulation of statistics is a well-honed craft: growth rates inflated, poverty figures massaged, dissent erased through numerical omission. The Chinese government, for example, was mocked for stopping the publication of data about youth unemployment when that information became embarrassing for the regime — and they have since stopped publishing hundreds of other economic statistics. The goal for epistemic authoritarians is not to understand reality but to fabricate one that consolidates power. That this logic is now migrating into the American context should be a matter of alarm for anyone who values either democratic accountability or rational policy-making.The politicization of the BLS is emblematic of a broader epistemic fracture: personal experiences are no longer triangulated with trustworthy public data and mediated analysis. Instead, we now inhabit a landscape where each faction has its own \"truth,\" its own feeds, its own experts. Trump's firing of McEntarfer is both a symptom and an accelerant of this fragmentation. He does not seek (or at any rate fails) to produce better results that would be revealed by data. He seeks to control the authority of facts themselves.The same authoritarian impulse is evident in Trump's recent slashing of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's budget. NOAA's mandate is to collect and publicly release climate data — and its data has formed the analytical bedrock of anthropogenic climate change that MAGA hates because it supports the case for phasing out fossil fuels. As with BLS and economic data, the \"targeted attack on climate data\" represents not just an environmental policy setback, but a deeper epistemological rupture. Like labor statistics, climate data is not merely information; it creates a form of public accountability for the results of global industrial pollution. By suppressing such data, Trump is not challenging scientific conclusions through argument or alternative evidence; he is seeking to preempt the possibility of argument altogether by removing the facts from circulation.Or to take another example: health data. HHS Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. has been undermining public health data, especially amid the 2025 measles outbreak and rising vaccine skepticism. HHS shelved a CDC forecast indicating that measles risk was particularly elevated in areas with low vaccination rates — data that could have informed and motivated public protection — on the ridiculous grounds that it did \"not say anything the public doesn't already know\" (if so, why suppress it?). Meanwhile, the department has slashed funding and support for local health workers, canceled measles vaccination clinics, and laid off staff at key agencies including the CDC, FDA, and NIH — crippling the capacity to gather, analyze, and distribute essential health data. Also Kennedy removed all 17 members of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and replaced them with vaccine skeptics, diminishing the credibility of vaccine guidance and injecting partisan bias into once-fact-based epidemiological deliberation. This is classic epistemic authoritarianism: if the data contradicts the narrative, eliminate the data as well as the stewards of that data. The goal is not to win debates in the public sphere, but to render them moot by controlling the informational terrain itself. Destroying public health data, halting climate data publication, firing the inconvenient BLS commissioner — it is all part of the epistemic authoritarian pattern. The aim in each case is to eliminate the instrumental infrastructure of shared public knowledge, that is, to disable society's capacity to reason collectively about shared challenges — be it economic hardship, the value of vaccinations, or the planetary polycrisis — by seizing control over the means of statistical production that renders those challenges visible in a shared way. As this trend continues, we risk arriving at a place where statistical outputs — on jobs, inflation, the weather, or anything else — carry no more civic weight than campaign speeches. The BLS, like the Census Bureau, the Congressional Budget Office, or the National Weather Service, is not just a technical body. It is a pillar of civic trust. To undermine it for partisan political advantage is to sap one of democracy's most essential prerequisites: the belief that facts, though sometimes uncomfortable, are real, and that reality matters. When such acts are repeated, rewarded, and normalized, they create feedback loops that degrade the informational commons upon which rational governance depends.What remains is the question of resistance. In the short term, our data-generating governmental institutions retain significant inertia, and many civil servants still take their role as neutral stewards of the facts seriously. But citizens and journalists need to recognize that defending the integrity of data is not merely a dry bureaucratic concern — it is a foundational democratic act. The facts do not defend themselves. We must. And we must do so not simply by rebutting lies, but by insisting on the institutional independence and statistical neutrality that make shared reality possible. Because if that vanishes, politics will becomes nothing more than performance — which in turn will mean that American democracy has become epistemically indistinguishable from the tyrannies we once defined ourself against.",

Today, we move from belief to action. I hope I made a good case that degrees of belief aren't fake, and today I hope I'll make a good case that utilities aren't totally fake. Of particular importance is the idea of a representation theorem, which is a theorem that says that if your preferences among choices under uncertainty satisfy certain axioms (such as transitivity), then we can come up with an assignment of utilities (real numbers) to outcomes such that you prefer one action to another if and only if it has greater expected utility. Some philosophers, then, argue that the axioms are constraints on rational choice, from which it would follow that insofar as you are a rational agent, you will be an expected utility maximizer for some utility function.

But not world-shaking. That is what I think. And I think I have good reasons for thinking so. But I might be wrong.I think that because the core of a GPT LLM ChatBot, after all, is a huge neural network that is trained to emulate the language-response patterns found in its training data. In practice, that means that its telos is to become a closer and closer approximation of the typical Internet s***poster.Yes, in addition to neural-network initial training, there is post-training RLHG, RAG, DPO, PEFT, LoRA, PPO, SFT, RM, IFT, and I am sure there will be at least five more such acronyms in common use in a year. But these are all merely (merely!) rough-and-ready ways to try to get the typical internet s***poster that is the ideal GPT LLM ChatBot to behave: to nudge it into a state in which the training data it sees around its attentive core is dense, and in which that training data was constructed by smart, informed people trying to communicate true and important stuff. Actively trying to strip the thing down so that it does not wander off into internet woo-woo land—that is an active area of \"research\".

(It is still the case that the best comprehensible introduction to this (for me at least) that I have been pointed to is still Alessandrini & al. (2023).) But. tThe results are very, very impressive indeed across a number of dimensions. And every time I reach this point, I am again unable to avoid quoting Shalizi (2023, 2025):Cosma Shalizi: 'Attention', 'Transformers', in Neural Network 'Large Language Models' <http://bactra.org/notebooks/nn-attention-and-transformers.html>: '\"It's Just Kernel Smoothing\" vs. \"You Can Do That with Just Kernel Smoothing!?!\": [That] takes nothing away from the incredibly impressive engineering accomplishment of making the blessed thing work.... nobody [before] achieved anything like the[se] feats.... [We] put effort into understanding... precisely because the results are impressive!...The neural network architecture here is doing some sort of complicated implicit smoothing across contexts... [that] has evolved (under the selection pressures of benchmark data sets and beating the previous state-of-the-art) to work well for text as currently found online.... Markov models for language are really old.... Nobody, so far as I know, has achieved results anywhere close to what contemporary LLMs can do. This is impressive...ShareSo I am left with a worrisome, nagging feeling: these things are unreasonably effective.Why are large language models (LLMs) so astonishingly effective? I guess: primarily because of scale. Trained on vast datasets and operating in thousands of dimensions, they capture the statistical patterns of human language. When you request a summary or script, the output is not true understanding, but a \"cultural average\"—how people have written such things before. The high dimensionality of these models' internal representations is important too. Doing math like \"king + woman - man ≈ queen\" is not just a clever parlor trick, but evidence of deeper structural regularities and even meaning encoded in the vectors and matrices. There is thus an emergent flexibility and richness come from the neural network's ability to classify and interpolate across a vast, multidimensional space.What does this mean in practice? LLMs excel at compressing, interpolating, and representing the latent structures of human language and knowledge. They are, as the phrase goes, \"autocomplete on steroids.\" Their outputs are plausible, coherent, and often insightful, even though they lack genuine understanding or grounding in reality. In my view, LLMs' \"unreasonable effectiveness\" is likely to have arisen from five main factors. First, their scale—massive data and computation—enables them to learn what hand-crafted rules cannot. Second, their statistical machinery allows them to interpolate between immense numbers of examples, producing plausible continuations for prompts that bear only a family resemblance to things they have seen. Third, their training uncovers latent structures that make language compressible and predictable, echoing Plato's dream of \"carving nature language at its joints.\" Fourth, their high-dimensional embeddings allow for analogical reasoning that mimics superficially much the way humans think. Fifth—and perhaps most important—a huge amount of real human thought is preserved in crystalized language pattern-correlations.Stil, with all of that: A great deal of time, energy, and effort has been spent training my 50W-drawing wetware that fits inside the small breadbox-sized bone enclosure at the top of my spine. That had better be better at true cognition—at searching out, absorbing, processing, and then signaling and conveying information. It is, after all, a full Turing-Class entity. If a blank-slate neural network orders-of-magnitude less complex trained to emulate a typical internet s***poster can steam-hammer-to-John-Henry me, that time, energy and effort has been largely wasted. That seems very unlikely. No. If you are actually going to build a Turing-Class sEntity, attention, scale, and a blank-slate neural network to train are highy unlikely to be all that you need. Thus think of them as the next step in the long tradition of tools that let us offload rote, repetitive, or formulaic parts of knowledge work, freeing up our attention for higher-order thinking. It is the next step in a process that started back when the first task of a scribe in writing a document was mixing the clay for the cuneiform to the proper consistency and smoothness, and the sudden ability to import papyrus to Sumer from Tawy was a true godsend.Share Brad DeLong's Grasping RealityAnd yet, suppose I am right that GPT LLM ChatBots are merely neural-network Markov-chain without AGI emergence Sub-Turing mimics of human minds.They are, still, very powerful cultural technologies for search and summarization above all. And for MOAR: also for link-following, code-snippet generating, ritual, milestone-marking, translation, genre-riffing, outlining, brainstorming, and more.These models are not reasoning agents. They cannot verify facts and are prone to hallucinations—confidently generating plausible-sounding nonsense. But they do have strengths. They are calculators for language, not philosophers. They are tools for offloading cognitive drudgery, not engines of new insight. This is a real and a big productivity gain, especially for those who already know what \"good\" looks like and simply need a first draft or a nudge in the right direction. They are not magical.But, still: They are remarkable. And useful. GPT LLMs should be considered remixers and redistributors of existing culture, offering highly powerful affordances for access, recombination, and dissemination. There are dangers: the sheer persuasive power of a natural-language interface to humans tuned to human-sounding language primed to over-attribute intentionality. But if we guard against those, all of a sudden we now have a better way of funneling the firehose of information into a form in which we can make sense of it. We can distill the vast, chaotic sprawl of the territory human textual production into a manageable, if inevitably lossy, map. And while the map is not the territory, some maps can be very good and useful indeed.Thus these things are immensely useful for search and research. I do not know to what degree to blame Google executives' pursuit of advertising profits at all cost, and to what degree to blame SEO search-arbitrage attention jackals for the degeneration of Google search. But even in its present, something like ChatGPT is a better search engine than Google search as long as you tell it to act like a high-quality search engine. Witness Joe Weisenthal:Joe Weisenthal: ChatGPT Is Becoming My Default Search Engine <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-17/chatgpt-is-becoming-my-default-search-engine>: 'The same type of query on Google isn't nearly as useful.... The actual links that Google turns up (the old, core search business) is not nearly as helpful.... To be fair... Google is better... if I just want to find a Wikipedia page... or if I'm looking for a very specific phrase.... But for a range of queries, o3 from ChatGPT increasingly feels like a strictly better experience...Leave a commentThe act of using a GPT LLM to query the internet should not be thought of as an act of delegating thought, but rather of curating and steering a process of retrieval from the memory of the Anthology Super-Intelligence that is Humanity's Collective Mind. collective memory retrieval; the user's judgment remains indispensable. GPT LLMs promise to democratize access to cultural and intellectual resources, enabling non-experts to interact with and synthesize information in ways previously reserved for the highly literate or technically skilled. They also promise to greatly amplify the cognitive information-surveying and information-acquisition capabilities of those skilled in their use. They are, I think, going to provide us with much better whips and chairs for trying to tame informational overload than we had even five short years ago.Thus whether or not I am wrong about the limits of these ChatBots, natural-language interfaces to structured and unstructured datastores promise to be very useful indeed to somebody like me who is both a huge user of datastores and a very sophisticated user of natural language. So how can I quickly and easily gain the maximum amount of facility with these tools so I can use them for good, and not either let the potential benefit I might draw from them wither on the vine, or, worse, find somebody else using them to hack my brain for my detriment?(And also if I am wrong, learn quickly that I need to start practicing for when I will have to, in five years, bend the knee to our AI-Overlords.)These issues are now even more tremendously important because we do now have true information overload. This problem has been building for quite a while. If one is a white-collar worker—if one is a front-end node to and in the Anthology Super-Intelligence of Humanity's Collective Mind—one's tasks, whether it is that of trying to enrich or emprestige your employers so they pay you, or enrich your life—fall into three groups:The business of thinking through an issue once you have gathered your sources of information. The issue of then getting your conclusions disseminated in a form in which they are neither evanescent nor unpersuasive. The issue of finding and assembling the information that you need to actually do your thinking. Think of these as the signal, the process, and the funnel. Someone who wants to succeed and be useful to society in my business needs to be able to do all three, and to be able to do all three very well. I want very much to be able to do a better job in making sure that I read more of what I should be reading and from people who are not in the circle of usual suspects The problem is the funnel. Dealing with the funnel is becoming an increasingly large part of our jobs. And here is where the hope that our modern information technologies understood as cultural technologies of summarization and classification may of great help.I do not understand how these things work (but does anybody?). I do not understand how to use them well. There is too much to read. There is too much to experiment with. And yet, as Cosma Shalizi says, we \"clearly... need to wrap... [our] head[s] around it, before... [we soon] become technically obsolete...\"Give a gift subscriptionAnd so I am going to try to spend the next month going all-in on The Browser Company's Dia Browser <https://www.diabrowser.com/>. What is Dia Browser? One of legion coming down the pike:M. G. Seigler: Begun, the AI Browser Wars Have <https://spyglass.org/ai-browser-wars/?ref=the-spyglass-column-newsletter: 'Dia ushers in a new day for the web browser.... You could basically just use Dia as a slightly cleaner-looking version of Chrome... and never touch the AI elements.... [But] if Dia is going to succeed, it will be because of AI. As such, they're now in a foot race.... Google... every other browser... dabbling in some level of AI... Perplexity and... OpenAI.... Anyone who uses Dia should see why all of these players will build their own browsers. Extensions aren't going to be good enough here, you have to go deeper to fully control the experience and have full vision into what's going on in that browser...Dia Browser is, with a \"@\" denoting a link to another browser tab:Chat with your tabs... Hey Dia...Write with your tabs... Make this @JuneNewsletter sound on-brand @BrandVoice...Learn with your tabs... Explain this to me like I'm five @Singularities...Plan with your tabs... Compare @TuscanVilla @IlCasone in a table with price, proximity, to best coffee...Shop with your tabs... Convince me not to buy this @VintageFendiBaguette... <https://www.diabrowser.com/>The idea is that with every webpage you visit you can then immediately, seemlessly ask a question related to it, also bringing in whatever else you think is potentially relevant to the answer you get. The hope is to make the interaction-feedback loop as tight as possible, and then see what develops.Dia is The Browser Company's second project. The first was their power-user browser Arc: <https://arc.net/> \"The Chrome Replacement You've Been Waiting For!\" The Browser Company's ambition with Arc Browser was never just technical—it was anthropological. Their goal was to make the browser feel like a home on the internet, personal and customizable, letting users shape the technology to fit their lives to extend and adapt their browser into a digital home.Dia Browser aims at this with a twist: empowering users—even those with no coding experience—to build their own tools and workflows by what is now called \"vibe coding\". The bet is that one of the true promises of MAMLMs is in providing natural-language in-the-moment tool-building for simple bespoke software to help us navigate the messy, context-rich decisions of real life—like planning a trip, balancing preferences, or making sense of ambiguity.Traditionally, browsers have served as \"funnels for intent\"—the search box where users express what they want—and as platforms for running webapps. But why should the browser omnibox link only to legacy search engines? Why not route intent to other digital experiences, webapps, including those powered by AI? Perhaps most value now lies not in the browser itself, but in what can be built atop it. The goal is a personal assistant—an \"intelligence layer\"—that sits across all devices, learns from user context, and helps manage tasks, not just tabs. In this new landscape, context, memory, and personalization may be the true differentiators and wisdom amplifiers. The Browser Company found that users of the alpha version quickly found their way to writing their own simple prompts for the ChatBot in the right pane of the browser window to act on the webpage in the left to automate or streamline their daily tasks: new tools, workflows, and automations, mini-agents and micro-applications that users could build for themselves, or frictionlessly adopt and then modify. Refer a friendPerhaps the browser is about to undergo a radical transformation in this age of MAMLMs. Perhaps a good way for it to take advantage of natural-language interface and stupendous classification capatilities is for it to stand in the middle, intercepting and interpreting my intent, turning the searchbox into a launchpad for personalized, context-aware assistance and assistants. Perhaps context, memory, and customization become key. The Browser Company thinks its Dia Browser could soon become my most valuable ally in dealing with information overload.Is The Browser Company right?I think I need to experiment enough to see.Get 50% off a group subscriptionReferences:Alessandrini, Giulio, Brad Klee, & Stephen Wolfram. 2023. \"What Is ChatGPT Doing ... and Why Does It Work?\". <https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/>.Browser Company of New York. 2025. \"Meet Dia – the AI Browser Where You Can Chat with Your Tabs.\" Dia Browser. https://www.diabrowser.com/.Chiang, Ted. 2023. \"ChatGPT Is a Blurry JPEG of the Web.\" The New Yorker, February 9. https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web.DeLong, J.

The integrity of America's economic data is now gone. The United States just crossed a new Rubicon in the politicization of economic facts. When official data are recast as political liabilities rather than neutral facts, the consequences ripple outward: from financial markets to the Federal Reserve, from policymakers to the public.

This is the same Bureau of Labor Statistics that overstated the Jobs Growth in March 2024 by approximately 818,000 and, then again, right before the 2024 Presidential Election, in August and September, by 112,000. These were Records - No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes. McEntarfer said there were only 73,000 Jobs added (a shock!) but, more importantly, that a major mistake was made by them, 258,000 Jobs downward, in the prior two months. Similar things happened in the first part of the year, always to the negative. The Economy is BOOMING under \"TRUMP\" despite a Fed that also plays games, this time with Interest Rates, where they lowered them twice, and substantially, just before the Presidential Election, I assume in the hopes of getting \"Kamala\" elected - How did that work out?

      "content": "Greetings from Read Max HQ, now returned to its rightful place in Brooklyn! Today, we're writing about Luke Farritor, \"cracked coders,\" and \"epistemic arrogance.\"Read Max, in case you have forgotten, is funded almost entirely by paying subscribers. The reading, writing, panic attacks, anxiety scrolling, spacing out, etc. that goes in to any given newsletter is extensive, and the support of generous readers helps make this a full-time job. Think of it this way: If you're a free subscriber who's found Read Max entertaining, informative, enjoyable, distracting, \"not the worst thing you've read,\" you can do the monetary equivalent of \"buying me a beer\" by subscribing, for almost the exact price of a beer. Plus, paying subscribers will get a second weekly newsletter featuring recommendations for underrated and overlooked movies, books, and music.Subscribe nowThis week Bloomberg published a write-around profile of Luke Farritor, maybe the most prominent non-testicular name among the army of young men hired out of the tech industry to staff Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency in the early days of the Trump administration. Farritor was relatively well-known even before his involvement with D.O.G.E. because he was a member of the team that won the Vesuvius Challenge Prize in 2024, having written the script that identified legible characters in the famously indecipherable Herculaneum Papyri, and the framing of the article (written by Susan Berfield, Margi Murphy and Jason Leopold) is something like \"how did this ambitious, smart, super-online, home-schooled libertarian kid who won a scientific-A.I. prize end up illegally gutting USAID and the N.I.H.?\" The answer, of course, is that he's ambitious, smart, super-online, home-schooled, and libertarian; the reporting about Farritor's pre-D.O.G.E life suggests that he's always been \"cracked\" (i.e., a great and obsessive programmer), hard-working, and abrasive, easily influenced by the whims and obsessions of his Twitter feed and his tech heroes:On Politichat, a group chat set up by Raikes students, Farritor identified himself as \"hopelessly libright.\" That's \"lib\" for libertarian. \"He would be passionate about being contrary,\" says one classmate. \"I don't know the extent that he believed in some of the things. He just wanted to push people.\" That wasn't always welcome. Like a lot of group chats, it became a \"pretty rough echo chamber,\" wrote one classmate who created a private chat, Calm Politichat, to allow dissenting opinions to be heard more openly. Farritor was invited to join.Farritor's political discussion seemed to mirror his own Twitter feed—among its prominent figures were the Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who would go all in for Donald Trump in 2024; Peter Thiel, the libertarian who helped fund Trump's first campaign; and Elon Musk. \"He thought that Musk was the closest thing to Iron Man. He loved that Musk was pushing the envelope in all these ways,\" says one classmate. \"I remember at one point Musk was going on a big series about how everyone needs to have more children,\" says another. \"Farritor started talking about that in Politichat. I remember thinking: 'Why is this something we're talking about?' What he talked about was based on the whims of his algorithms. We were participating more in university life.\"Maybe unsurprisingly, his former classmates seem somewhat skeptical of Farritor's sudden rise to power:Former classmates were surprised he had joined DOGE. Some were disturbed, some angry, some proud. \"Luke doesn't represent Raikes, and he isn't a product of it,\" says one. \"It felt cool for someone from the Raikes School to be in the limelight,\" says another. \"Then it very quickly turned to a little bit of concern.\" A third texted Farritor something like: Hey man, saw the news and am rooting for you. Farritor replied something like: Thank you. Hope you and your family are doing well. Even some who believed he was doing harm were still concerned enough to inquire about him: Thanks, I'm OK.But when a former friend posted an article critical of Farritor and DOGE on Instagram, Farritor replied with a meme of a crying baby and the caption: \"When the corrupt elites can't access USAID anymore.\" Farritor was blocked by that account too. [...]Some of Farritor's classmates wondered about the power he seemed to have been given. \"Like the entirety of DOGE is scary. It's very much like going into government and dismantling the core foundations. It's scary from that perspective. And it's scary that it's 22- and 23-year-olds doing it. And I'm saying this as a 23-year-old,\" one classmate says. \"Normally I think experience shouldn't matter all that much. But for the government I would like people to have experience.\"As interesting as the article itself, I would say, was the reaction from the broad universe of Musk-sympathetic tech posters on Twitter. Casey Handmer, a V.C. and Vesuvius Challenge collaborator who was quoted in the Bloomberg piece, complained on Twitter that the article was \"irresponsible... defamatory\" and \"brings dishonor upon the profession\" of journalism: The anti-woke tech publicist Lulu Chang Meservey, meanwhile, singled out for ridiculte an anonymous government source who told Bloomberg's reporters that \"Luke's résumé didn't pass muster\" because \"you have to bring some expertise\":As many have already pointed out on Twitter, what is so particularly upsetting about the article to people like Handmer and Meservey is less that it doesn't pcredit Farritor with intellectual ability (it does, consistently) or that it doesn't properly contextualize his glib cruelty with reference to the correct fever-dream conspiracy theories that would justify it, but that straightforward facts of the D.O.G.E. saga challenge one of the fundamental beliefs of the new Tech Right: That a sufficient number of sufficiently \"cracked\" programmers can solve any problem put in front of them. Or, put more broadly, that \"intelligence\" is a quality measurable on on a single scale equally applicable across all spheres of human activity.This is so obviously wrong it seems strange to even have to describe why: Writing a Python script to identify Greek characters, impressive though it certainly is, doesn't translate in any direct way into \"administering budget cuts across a range of government agencies.\" But in Silicon Valley, steeped in I.Q. fetishism, an obsession with \"agency,\" and a moral universe still governed by fantasy high-school resentments, the belief that (heritable) single-vector \"intelligence\" endows one with full-spectrum authority (and, inversely, that failure to demonstrate this intelligence is delegitimizing), holds sway. \"Just put 10 cracked programmers in charge of it\" has become the (admittedly at least somewhat trollish) stance of the Tech Right when faced with any sufficiently un-deferential institution, enterprise, or bureaucracy.1 (Politically speaking, this idea overlaps appealingly and naturally with the widespread low-information voter belief that a single sufficiently driven and common-sensical guy could \"fix\" the government--see, e.g., the movies Swing Voter, Dave, Man of the Year, or any interview with a swing Trump voter.)But as the article pretty plainly demonstrates, D.O.G.E. is the highest-profile and most consequential example of how ineffective and destructive this idea is. The agency's failure to succeed even on its own terms (it didn't come anywhere close to making cuts of the size initially promised by Musk), and the fact that its legacy is, at best, the needless deaths of hundreds of thousands of people around the globe, is about as clear an indication as possible that \"put 10 cracked programmers in charge\" (let alone just one) is not a good solution to basically any problem faced by any large organization, and especially not particularly complex and sensitive ones like the U.S. government. Farritor is certainly very smart, in the sense of being a good programmer and problem-solver. But working effectively at a high-level position within a complex bureaucracy requires not just \"cracked\" coding ability and work ethic but domain expertise, relevant experience--and even those widely derided \"soft skills.\"One particularly noteworthy aspect of both the article and the reaction was the way it revealed what I suppose you'd call epistemic arrogance--a total lack of curiosity about how the agencies D.O.G.E. gutting might work, or why a government source might suggest that even an impressive \"Python A.I. thing\" is not a sufficient C.V. for this kind of government work. These tweets from Bo Austin help get at what I mean:Epistemic arrogance is baked in to the culture of Silicon Valley: Blind, foolhardy confidence may be terrible for operating within large and intricate systems, but it's great for founding and investing in regulations-flouting software companies. Many of the industry's leading lights are proud ignoramuses, completely unaware of the gaps and blind spots in their knowledge, and ambitious young hackers and programmers are no doubt modeling their own attitudes toward the world on the overconfident performance of genius by people like Elon Musk. But what seems particularly striking about this arrogance at this moment, though, is the extent to which it's also baked into--and reinforced by--the L.L.M.-based chatbots now driving billions of dollars of investment. L.L.M.-based chatbots are effectively epistemic-arrogance machines: They \"themselves\" have no idea what they \"know\" or don't, and in many circumstances will generate baldly incorrect text before admitting to lacking knowledge. Their accuracy has improved significantly over the past three years, but an L.L.M. chatbot fundamentally can't know what it doesn't know.Worse, they're all but designed to negotiate around and even reinforce the epistemic arrogance of their users, obsequiously confirming their insights, praising their fluency, and overlooking their blind spots and knowledge gaps. I was agog, for example, to read that Travis Kalanick recently claimed that he's come \"close to some interesting breakthroughs\" in quantum physics just by conversing with Grok--truly the definition of a man who doesn't know what he doesn't know:\"I'll go down this thread with [Chat]GPT or Grok and I'll start to get to the edge of what's known in quantum physics and then I'm doing the equivalent of vibe coding, except it's vibe physics,\" Kalanick explained. \"And we're approaching what's known. And I'm trying to poke and see if there's breakthroughs to be had. And I've gotten pretty damn close to some interesting breakthroughs just doing that.\"What's strange here is that epistemic humility is in some sense the single most important skill necessary to make good use of these chatbots--an awareness not just of their limitations, but also of your own. Unleashing the bots among a population of billionaires who share their precise weakness seems like a good way to compound the cruelty and destruction. 1I suspect the recent popularity of this sentiment in Silicon Valley is, like many other aspects of the tech reaction of the 2020s, fundamentally a function of the business environment of the software industry: The fast-growing, relatively lawless startups for which Silicon Valley was known in the 2010s have evolved into a small number of large, slow-moving bureaucracies. The fantasy of replacing restive employees and annoying H.R. departments with a handful of \"cracked\" 22-year-olds must be a powerful one both to executives and to the 22-year-old programmers, whose job prospects are otherwise fairly dismal.",

Institutions that might produce inconvenient information, from those tracking climate change to those tracking infectious disease, have been special targets.And now they've come for the economic data.As I and many others have pointed out, this mornings jobs report was very bad: It didn't signal a recession — not yet — but it showed a rapidly slowing economy. And it was presumably especially disturbing for Trump and those around him, who have been boasting about how hot the economy is and sneering at critics pointing to the harm being done by chaotic policy. For this report seems to validate the critics.So there was only one thing to do: Trump summarily fired the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her without evidence of manipulating the numbers for political purposes.Who could have seen this coming? Anyone paying attention. The picture at the top is a screenshot from a post I put up just before Trump took office. I was mainly focused on politicization and corruption of inflation data, but it's the same principle — and would involve the same organization.People who don't follow these things closely may not realize how important the Bureau of Labor Statistics is. But it's our prime source of short-term information about economic developments. The BLS conducts a monthly survey of households that is, among other things, how we estimate unemployment. It conducts another survey, of employers, which is where we get estimates of payroll growth like the one above. A third survey, of prices, is the basis for the Consumer Price Index, and supplies the basic data for other inflation measures too.The BLS isn't always right, nor should you expect it to be. It's trying to track a complex economy, and sometimes it revises its past estimates — as it did this morning. But it is extremely professional, rigorously nonpartisan, and everyone in the business considers it the gold standard for economic data.Or maybe I should say \"it was\" rather than \"it is\". I have to admit that I expected Trump's corruption of economic data to be insidious and take place gradually. Instead he just fired the head of the BLS because he didn't like the numbers it reported — a clear signal to the remaining staff not to report bad news.And just like that, we can no longer treat BLS data as the gold standard. (Maybe Trump will use the gold on the walls of his new ballroom.) Maybe, just maybe, the staff at the BLS will hold to their principles and continue to report honestly. But how can we trust what they report — especially if Trump flunkies are put in charge, filtering what gets released? From here on, I'm going to be paying a lot more attention to private surveys. And when they tell a different story from the official numbers, there will no longer be a reason to take the official data more seriously.It's one more step on our rapid descent into banana republic status.",

Mattie Lubchansky's 'Simplicity' (permalink) Cartoonist Mattie Lubchansky has a new, horny, weird, amazing science fiction graphic novel called Simplicity and it drops today: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/739012/simplicity-by-mattie-lubchansky/ Simplicity is set in the not-so-distant future, in which the US has dissolved and its major centers have been refashioned as \"Administrative and Security Territories\" – a fancy way of saying \"walled corporate autocracies.\" Lucius Pasternak is an anthropology grad student in the NYC AST, a trans-man getting by as best as he can, minimizing how much he sells out, which is not enough to make his bosses treat him with respect, but is more than his friends can stomach. Pasternak's fortunes improve when he gets a big, juicy assignment: to embed with a Catskills community of weirdo sex-hippies who supply the most coveted organic produce in the NYC AST. They've been cloistered in an old summer camp since the 1970s, and when civilization collapsed, it barely touched them. Pasternak's mission is to chronicle the community and its strange ways for a billionaire's vanity-project museum of New York State. The meat of the action is set in Simplicity, the Catskills home of the Spiritual Association of Peers, where Pasternak struggles to gain the support and trust of the community, working their gardens by day and, eventually, attending their orgy/free-for-all nightly rituals, where the community members work out their tension and aggression through a mix of wild sex and punch-ups. But no matter how diligently Pasternak tries to fit in, he still finds himself at the community's margins, unable to win over their trust. Then, just as he starts to make some progress, members of the community start going missing, turning up horribly mutilated. The horror of this is compounded by the erotic, nightmarish visions that have haunted Pasternak since his arrival in Simplicity, of a many-tentacled, many-mawed, many-vulvaed monster. Pasternak's bosses abruptly recall him to the NYC AST, and that's when he learns the true nature of his mission to Simplicity, and the story moves into a thrilling, action-packed final act with an extremely satisfying conclusion. This is such a tight little tale, speedily told in that way of the best graphic novels, which cram so much expressivity and atmosphere into the visual storytelling. It's got shades of Ellis's Transmetropolitan and Matt Bors's Justice Warriors: https://pluralistic.net/2023/05/22/libras-assemble/#the-uz This is post-cyberpunk, ecosexual revolutionary storytelling at its finest. I know Lubchansky mostly from her absolutely amazing podcast, No Gods, No Mayors (co-hosted with Trashfuture's November Kelly and Riley Quinn), where she is incredibly charming, funny, and incisive: https://www.patreon.com/nogodsnomayors If you'd asked me to imagine what kind of science fiction graphic novel she would turn out, I probably wouldn't have guessed this one – but now that I've read it, I'm not surprised at all that it came from her.

Rainer Maria Rilke (Photo by ullstein bild via Getty Images)It was in 1906 that Bohemian aristocrat Sidonie Nádherná von Borutín first met Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke, beginning a lengthy friendship sustained through hundreds of letters that touched on love, art, and loss. Seven years into that relationship, in July of 1913, Nádherná's beloved brother took his own life at the age of 29. Days later, from the seaside town of Heiligendamm, Rilke sent her a letter.Heiligendamm, 1 August 1913My dear Sidie,Your letter moves me deeply. On the one hand, I want to encourage you in your grief, so that you may fully experience it in all its depth. For as an encounter with a new intensity, it is a profound experience of life and leads you back toward life again, as all things do that reach a certain degree of extremity. On the other hand, I feel anxious when I imagine how hemmed in and constricted your life must be right now, afraid of bumping into anything filled with memory, and what isn't filled with memory? You will freeze if you stay like this. You mustn't, my love. You have to move. You must return to his things, you must lay hands on his things, which, by so many bonds and attractions, are also yours.You must, Sidie (this is the task that this unfathomable fate lays upon you), you must continue his life within your own, as far as it was left unfinished. His life has now passed over into yours. You, who knew him so completely, can carry it forward entirely in his spirit. Give your grief this task: to discover what he expected of you, hoped for you, wished for you.If only I could convince you, my friend, that his influence has not vanished from your existence. How much more clearly I feel my father active and helpful within me since he has no longer been among us. Consider this: how much confusion, how much daily disturbance dims and distorts the love of another. Now he is more present than ever, now he is entirely free to be present, and we are entirely free to feel him. Have you not felt your father acting and participating a thousand times over from that space beyond, where everything, everything, Sidie, is beyond loss?Don't believe that something which belonged to our purest realities could disappear or cease to be. What once had such a sure effect on us was already a reality independent of all the circumstances familiar to us here. That's why we felt it so differently, with such unconditioned longing. Because it was already not rooted in this world or determined by it.All our true relationships, all our deepest experiences stretch across the whole, Sidie. Across life and death. We must live in both, be deeply at home in both. I know people who meet the one and the other with the same trusting love. Is life more knowable or entrusted to us than that other state? Are they not both, namelessly, set beyond us, both unreachable? We are only true and pure when we open ourselves willingly to the whole, to the unresolved, to the great, to the greatest.Ah, if only I could say this to you as I know it. Deep within your grief a core of dark joy would begin to form.Resolve to be brave. Be brave this very evening. Play Beethoven. He, too, belonged to the whole.Yours,RainerThis newsletter continues to exist thanks to the generosity of its readers.

Plus a professional central banker must always keep a weather eye on all potential sources of risk, and never unduly minimize any of them.To declare, as Waller did, that such risks are \"limited\" is to attempt to lull markets and policymakers into complacency—precisely the opposite of what a prudent monetary authority should do. At the very least the standard of professionalism would require a nuanced and conditional framing: \"While recent data suggest upside risks to inflation are moderating, those risks could return—particularly if supply constraints return or if aggregate demand surprises to the upside.\" I would have liked to see something like: If the enormous uncertainty about future tariff increases were to be removed, then upside risks to inflation would be significantly reduced. The message that the Fed should be sending to Donald Trump right now is this: if you are serious about lower interest rates, give us policies that make a lower interest rate path prudent.Fed Governors, even tempted to go the extra mile in currying favor with Donald Trump, perhaps out of hope that their fealty will land them in the big chair at the Federal Reserve—really should behave better. Remember Arthur Burns in the early 1970s, whose willingness to accommodate the Nixon administration's political imperatives did lasting damage to the Fed's credibility and amply watered and fertilized the sprouting Great Inflation of the 1970s. The central bank's power is mostly a power of narrative and expectation management. Once the perception takes hold that policy is being tailored to the whims of the incumbent or the ambitions of a would-be Fed Chair, little can be done, and what can be done quickly becomes very costly. Fed Governors must always remember who their true constituency is: not the president du jour, but rather the long-term economic and financial heualth of the republic. Now matter what a corrupt Supreme Court may claim, Fed Governors have their 14-year terms precisely because they are not instrumentalities to carry out the whims of an underbriefed chaos-monkey executive-branch president with dementia, but rather independent technocratic powers making decisions about coining money and regulating the value thereof as directed by the congress.All that is to say: A false claim that upside inflation risks are limited is not helpful. Today, the sources of potential upside risk to inflation are not low: chaos-monkey dementia-fueled tariff craziness continued, renewed energy shock, a reversal in globalization, an unexpected fiscal expansion, or, as we are already observing, the AI-driven data-center construction boom that is channeling a torrent of investment into the real economy. Central bankers need to never dismiss these risks out of hand, but to take the prudent course, which is to acknowledge uncertainty and to keep all options on the table, rather than to lull the polity into a false sense of security that may soon prove costly.And yet, that said: Waller has, I think, a sound desire to become Fed Chair. rooted both in personal ambition and in a genuine conviction that, among the names likely to appear on a hypothetical Trump short list, he would be the most responsible and competent steward of U.S. monetary policy. In my view, he is correct. I would breathe somewhat easier, at a disaster (probably) averted, if Waller were to become Fed Chair next year. Waller is not like those whom one might politely call \"mercurial\" or \"ideologically-driven\" who might catch Trump's chaos-monkey dementia-addled eye. He has the analytic and procedural norms that keep monetary policy on an even keel in his bones. The prospect of someone with his background and temperament at the helm is, in this fraught moment, a source of some comfort—if, admittedly, of only some and rather cold comfort.Refer a friendA note on one of the things creating upside inflation risks right now: Consider the sheer magnitude of the data-center construction boom fueled by the current AI bubble.This is a phenomenon that, I think, deserves far more attention from both policymakers and market-watchers. The scale is staggering. Over the four years 2024-2027 we now expect to see more than $1.8 trillion spent building not bricks-and-mortar but rather generator, wire, silicon, plywood, concrete, pipe, and steel data centers worldwide. The hyperscalers and others are each pouring tens of billions of dollars into new facilities globally, in a frantic bid to secure the computational horsepower and energy infrastructure needed to train and deploy ever-larger natural-language models. This is not your garden-variety tech cycle; it is a capital expenditure arms race, and the urgency is driven less by exuberant optimism for future profits than by a defensive fear—fear that failing to provide customers with the lowest-latency inference and the highest-quality training will mean irrelevance in the next platform transition. The result is a wave of demand for construction labor, steel, concrete, specialized semiconductors, and, most crucially, power—already putting upward pressure on input prices in regions like northern Virginia, Texas, and the Pacific Northwest. Historically, such sectoral investment booms have had the power to push up wages and prices even in the absence of broad-based consumer-demand surges. The AI data-center surge is not a sideshow: it is a macroeconomic force that could well become a significant contributor to inflation dynamics in the quarters ahead, and one that the Fed ignores at its peril.The investment triggered by other bubbles died off as businesses saw themselves as unlikely to make profits from further investments, even with the extraordinary investment-financing terms that the bubble's irrational exuberance offered them...Not this time: these AI data-center investments are defensive insurance, not attempts to massively grow their profits. That is, unlike the dot-com or fiber-optic booms of the late 1990s, or the shale oil bonanza of the 2010s, the current wave of capital expenditure is less about chasing speculative upside than about preempting existential risk. The buidlers are not betting on blue-sky demand projections or the hope that \"if we build it, they will come.\" Instead, they are acting out of fear that, should they fail to keep pace in providing the lowest-latency inference and the highest-quality model training, they will be left behind in the next technological paradigm shift. This is primarily a race to avoid irrelevance and the loss of their current tech oligopoly-platform profits, not to seize new territory. The result is a remarkable stickiness to investment, even as financing costs have risen and macro uncertainty abounds. The willingness to sign multi-year power purchase agreements, lock in supply chains for specialized semiconductors, and pre-commit to massive construction contracts all reflect this insurance logic. It is a dynamic that, I think, makes the potential inflationary potential of the current boom more persistent and less susceptible to the usual self-correcting mechanisms that have tamed previous bubbles. No. Rather than believe that inflation risks are no longer worth considering, much better to recognize that there is more than a whiff of stagflation in the air:Jared Bernstein: Inflation ticks up; real consumer spending still flat for the year <https://econjared.substack.com/p/inflation-ticks-up-real-consumer>: 'Core PCE inflation... rose 0.3% in June and 2.8% over the past year.... Headline... up 2.6%.... Given that the tariffs are now clearly taking hold, I'm concerned about their direction of travel.... Core is stuck... overall... is ticking back up.... These are far from alarming rates... but... we are now seeing two quite challenging developments.... Trump's trade war is escalating, with tariffs spewing out of the White House like toxic smoke from a dumpster fire, and two, we're now seeing consumer price-passthrough at both anecdotal and statistical levels.... There's a whiff of stagflation.... Growth for the first half of the year, at 1.2%, has been subpar.... Triffs, not to mention deportations that are particularly punishing to certain sectors... are taking a toll on prices and production.... These impacts are... gradual...ShareAnd the magnitude of this bubble-driven boom has a consequence. Normally I would react to a jobs report like this by stating that there is now at least a 50-50 chance of a near-term recession. But not this time. I cannot make any sort of likely recession call—not with this going on.Leave a commentSubscribe nowIf reading this gets you Value Above Replacement, then become a free subscriber to this newsletter.

What’s neat: when a dot flashes for a new strike, a circle expands around it. This circle grows at the speed of sound; if you watch the map and a circle moves over where you’re standing, you’ll simultaneously hear the thunder. (The webpage corrects for network latency.) It feels a little like being able to peep two seconds into the future. ESPECIALLY NEAT: The map comes from an open hardware project and a global community, \"a lightning detection network for locating electromagnetic discharges in the atmosphere.\" i.e. you can get a little box to keep in your house. The sources of the signals we locate are in general lightning discharges. The abbreviation VLF (Very Low Frequency) refers to the frequency range of 3 to 30 kHz. The receiving stations approximately record one millisecond of each signal with a sampling rate of more than 500 kHz. With the help of GPS receivers, the arrival times of the signals are registered with microsecond precision and sent over the Internet to our central processing servers. This live map shows strikes and lines to the detectors that triangulated them. Approx 4,000 active stations. 2. BirdWeather map: Global map of detected bird vocalisations from approx 1,000 distributed monitoring stations. e.g. the common wood-pigeon has been heard 153,211 times in the last 24 hours. The “station” device is called PUC, \"our AI powered bioacoustics platform\" – a weatherproof green plastic triangle with microphones, GPS, Wi-Fi and so on. I would love to be able to use this to visualise the common swift migrations across Europe and Africa, a wave of birds on the wing sloshing back and forth year upon year, 50 million swifts oscillating ten thousand kilometres at 31.7 nanohertz. (Folks in my neighbourhood recently got together to install few dozen swift boxes up high on our houses, hoping to provide nesting sites. So we’ve all been swapping swift sightings on WhatsApp.) SEE ALSO: An actual weather site, Weather Underground, which is powered by networked personal weather stations available here. 3. Flightradar24: When I’m outside staring at the blue sky and a big plane flies over, or first thing in the morning as all the planes that have been circling over the North Sea waiting for Heathrow to open get on descent and land at two minute internals, boom, boom, boom right overhead and wake me up, I like to check the app to find out where they’ve come from. I didn’t realise that the Flightradar data isn’t from some kind of air traffic control partnership – planes all broadcast data automatically, and so they distribute ADS-B receivers for people to plug into (a) an antenna and (b) their home internet, and they triangulate the planes like that. 50,000 connected ground stations (April 2025). 4. Raspberry Shake earthquake map: Use the Map Filters menu to show only particular events. Interesting filters: ”Since yesterday” and ”Last 7 days, greater than magnitude 7.” You can purchase various Raspberry Shake sensors all built around 4.5 Hz geophone sensors, i.e. infrasound. So homing pigeons can hear earthquakes. And possible giraffes? Which hum in the dark at 14 Hz. ALSO: Earthquakes propagate at 3-5 km/s. People post about earthquakes on Twitter within 20 to 30 seconds. So tweets are faster than earthquakes, beyond about 100km. Relevant xkcd (#723, April 2010). This can be automated… Google Android provides an earthquake early warning system: All smartphones contain tiny accelerometers that can sense vibrations, which indicate that an earthquake may be happening. If the phone detects something that it thinks may be an earthquake, it sends a signal to our earthquake detection server, along with a coarse location of where the shaking occurred. The server then combines information from many phones to figure out if an earthquake is happening. This approach uses the 2+billion Android phones in use around the world as mini-seismometers to create the world’s largest earthquake detection network. 5. Space! SatNOGS network map – an open satellite ground station network, mainly used for tracking cubesats in LEO (low Earth orbit). Build your own ground station. Over 4,000 stations. Global Meteor Network map (shows meteor trajectories spotted yesterday). You can build your own kit or buy a plug-and-play camera system to point at the night sky. Here’s an aggregate figure for the world: currently 53 meteors/hr. About 1,000 active stations? Project Argus (now dormant?) provides \"continuous monitoring of the entire sky, in all directions in real time\" for the purposes of spotting extraterrestrial messages: SETI. It uses/used amateur radio telescopes because typical research telescopes can only focus on a small part of the sky \"typically on the order of one part in a million.\" The name Argus derives from a 100-eyed being in Greek mythology. Project Argus has its own song, The Suns Shall Never Set on SETI. The project achieved 100 stations in October 2000 but would require 5,000 for total coverage. 6. Global Consciousness Project: Since 1999. A network of random number generators, centrally compared. As previously discussed (2024): a parapsychology project that uses a network of continuously active random number generators to detect fluctuations in, uh, the global vibe field I guess. The idea is \"when a great event synchronizes the feelings of millions of people,\" this may ripple out as a measurable change in, e.g. whether a flipped coin comes up EXACTLY 50/50 heads vs tails… or not. 10 active stations. The network is not currently being extended, but the software is available so maybe we could establish a shadow network for noosphere sousveillance. All worth keeping an eye on.

      "content": "So apparently we're all fighting about Sydney Sweeney's jeans now. Or her genes? Both, actually — that's the whole thing.This week, American Eagle dropped a new denim campaign featuring the actress sprawled across various surfaces while delivering this gem of ad copy: \"Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color.\" Then, with timing that would make a dad joke enthusiast proud, she adds: \"My jeans are blue.\"Get it? Genes. Jeans. She's wearing jeans and also has genetics. Revolutionary stuff.The Present Age is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.Within approximately 37 seconds, the internet did what the internet does. But here's the thing—when you actually look at this \"massive backlash,\" it starts to feel a bit... manufactured?Sure, some TikTokers made videos calling it fascist propaganda. A Columbia University lecturer analyzed it for eugenic messaging. But when you dig into the actual numbers, when you look for the hordes of furious liberals supposedly melting down over a jeans ad... they're surprisingly hard to find.What you can find, in abundance, is the backlash to the backlash. Vice President JD Vance gleefully telling podcast hosts that Democrats attacking Sydney Sweeney for being beautiful is \"how you're going to win the midterm.\" The White House communications director calling critics \"warped\" and \"moronic.\" Ted Cruz rushing to defend... a jeans commercial. Countless right-wing accounts sharing the same handful of critical TikToks as evidence of widespread liberal hysteria.The \"controversy\" even spawned a completely fake apology that went viral — one that joked about American Eagle not realizing \"how big her boobs would be.\" People shared it as if it were real, further proof of woke insanity. But it was just some content creator having a laugh.You don't need an actual controversy anymore. You just need the idea of one.And American Eagle? They're probably thrilled. Their stock price jumped, everyone's talking about their brand, and they got exactly what they wanted: attention. They might have even hired a crisis PR firm, though whether that's to handle actual criticism or just to look like they're taking the \"controversy\" seriously is anyone's guess.Photo by Stuart C. Wilson/Getty ImagesHow the outrage machine worksOver at The Atlantic, Charlie Warzel wrote one of the smartest takes I've read about this whole phenomenon. His piece on the Sydney Sweeney controversy doesn't just catalog the usual \"here's what people are saying on both sides\" nonsense. Instead, he dissects exactly how a jeans ad becomes a cultural battlefield, and why calling any of this \"discourse\" is completely wrong.Warzel nails the predictable cycle: \"Progressive posters register their genuine outrage. Reactionaries respond in kind by cataloging that outrage and using it to portray their ideological opponents as hysterical, overreactive, and out of touch. Then savvy content creators glom on to the trending discourse and surf the algorithmic waves... Yet another faction emerges: People who agree politically with those who are outraged about Sydney Sweeney but wish they would instead channel their anger toward actual Nazis.\"Sound familiar? It should, because we just lived through exactly this script. What started as maybe a dozen critical TikToks became \"proof\" of liberal hysteria, which became fodder for political statements, which became its own news cycle.But here's Warzel's key insight: none of these people are actually talking to each other. \"Instead, every participant—be they bloggers, randos on X, or people leaving Instagram comments — are issuing statements, not unlike public figures. Each of these statements becomes fodder for somebody else's statement.\"We're creating content for an algorithmic system that strips away all the original context while dumping in everything else happening in the world: political anxiety, celebrity gossip, culture war grievances, whatever random beef is trending that day. A legitimate concern about eugenic messaging gets processed alongside Doja Cat posts and Ted Cruz tweets until it all becomes the same thing: raw material for the engagement machine.And that machine doesn't care about making sense of anything. As Warzel puts it: \"This is not a process for sense-making; it is a process for making people feel upset at scale.\" The system works perfectly — just not for us.Random people become political symbolsThe most insidious part of this whole machine is how it turns random people into stand-ins for entire political movements.Warzel points out that news outlets are literally quoting Instagram comments from people with 119 followers and treating them as representative of broader public opinion. Some person leaves a comment on American Eagle's Instagram — maybe they're genuinely concerned, maybe they're trolling, maybe they're just trying to get likes — and suddenly BuzzFeed is presenting them as the voice of progressive outrage.This does two horrible things at once. First, it gives these random comments way more weight and attention than they were ever supposed to carry. That person with 119 followers probably wasn't trying to become the poster child for anti-eugenics activism, but now they're getting dogpiled by thousands of people who think they represent everything wrong with the left. Their offhand comment becomes ammunition in a war they never enlisted in.Second, it creates a sense of what \"people\" are actually saying. When you see a headline about \"critics slamming\" the Sweeney ad, you picture organized groups or prominent voices. You don't picture some person scrolling Instagram at 2am who left a comment that three people liked.But those throwaway social media posts become \"evidence\" that the left has lost its mind, or that fascism is creeping into jeans ads, or whatever narrative someone wants to push. The machine takes the most extreme or poorly worded takes from the least representative voices and presents them as what \"everyone\" on their respective sides is thinking.And here's the really sick part: once these random comments get amplified, they create the very controversy they're supposedly documenting. People see the headlines about \"backlash\" and feel compelled to pick a side, to defend or attack, to add their own statement to the pile. The fake controversy becomes real through sheer force of repetition.ShareThe one-sided accountability trapFormer congressman Joe Walsh just posted something on Bluesky that perfectly captures how this whole system works as a one-sided political trap. A Democratic campaign consultant supposedly texted him: \"This Sydney Sweeney thing is the kind of thing that turns men away from our party. It's why men think our party is weak & insane.\" Walsh's response? \"Fuck yea it is. You are exactly right.\"Democrats are constantly forced into taking responsibility for anything anyone vaguely left-coded says or does, anywhere, ever. Random college students protesting? Democrats have to answer for it. Someone on TikTok makes a comment about jeans being fascist? Time for Democratic soul-searching about why the party has lost touch with normal Americans.Republicans face no such burden. When actual Republican politicians appear alongside white nationalists or retweet QAnon accounts, it's treated as an individual choice that doesn't reflect on the broader party. When conservative influencers spread conspiracy theories and hate, Republican strategists aren't fielding concerned texts about how it's driving away suburban moms.But let some random progressive on Instagram react to an ad campaign, and suddenly every Democrat needs to have a position on Sydney Sweeney's genetics.Democrats get held accountable for every unhinged take from someone who might vote blue, while Republicans get to distance themselves from even their own elected officials when convenient. The asymmetry makes it nearly impossible for Democrats to control their own messaging, because they're constantly being defined by people who don't speak for them and never asked to.Walsh's post does exactly what it pretends to criticize: it takes the manufactured outrage, amplifies it, and uses it as a cudgel against Democrats. He's not describing a real problem. He's creating one.Look, I'm not saying there weren't legitimate concerns about the ad. When actual eugenicists are gaining mainstream platforms and the government is posting straight-up racist imagery on social media, yeah, people are going to be hypervigilant about a blonde woman talking about genetic inheritance. That's not crazy. That's pattern recognition.But the speed at which those concerns got weaponized, distorted, and turned into ammunition for the culture war? That's the real problem. We've built a system where every reaction becomes proof of someone's worst assumptions about their political enemies. Where a jeans ad can somehow become evidence that Democrats hate attractive women and Republicans love Nazis, simultaneously.The exhausting truth is that this will happen again next week. And the week after that. Some brand will do something vaguely provocative, a handful of people will react, and we'll all pretend it's the most important thing happening in America. Politicians will weigh in. Think pieces will be written. Everyone will feel angry and righteous and absolutely certain they're on the right side.",

      "content": "Imagine waking up tomorrow in a world very different from our own. There is no society, nor do you have any friends or acquaintances. You must fend for yourself, acquiring your own food. Disease runs rampant. The world is filled with monsters that are trying to kill and eat you, often slowly over the course of many minutes. You're constantly hungry, thirsty, and in discomfort from temperature extremes. Then, after about a week of this brutal existence, you die painfully—from starvation, being eaten alive, disease, thirst, or being crushed to death. Question: was your life worth living? Obvious answer: no! But this is the life that nearly every conscious animal on Earth will ever experience. For every human alive today, there are hundreds of millions of creatures consigned to this brief, brutal, and hellish existence. This is the life of nearly every animal, and it's why I'm generally in favor of decreasing wild animal populations. For every living human, there are around 100,000 fish and about 100 million insects. Almost all potentially-conscious animals are arthropods (a wide class of organisms that includes insects, shrimp, and lobsters), and of the ones that aren't arthropods, the vast majority are fish. Reptiles and amphibians are also quite numerous, though less so than fish. Many of these simple creatures can probably suffer intensely. The most numerous animals are small prey animals! Thus, to determine whether animals tend to live good lives, one should primarily look at the lives of small prey animals. Outside of our human bubble, almost everyone is a short-lived insect, decapod, amphibian, or fish! The most numerous species are all or nearly all R-strategists, meaning they give birth to enormous numbers of offspring few of whom survive for very long. Tuna lay about 10 million eggs (those don't all become live offspring, but many do) while salmon lay thousands. The ocean sunfish lays about 800 million!Populations tend to be roughly stable long run. If an organism has 100,000 offspring, on average about two of them will survive (otherwise populations grow exponentially until returning to stability). Thus, nearly every conscious creature who will ever live is a short-lived R-strategist, who will probably die after days or weeks. Adult mayflies, at the high end, only live a few hours; fish mostly starve to death after a few days of consciousness. This brief life is characterized by struggle. Food is scarce, there are constant dangers from predators who tear their victims limb from limb, starvation and disease are common, and temperature extremes cause constant discomfort. Because animals' lives are so brief, they don't have enough welfare to outweigh the badness of death. If you live for a week and then get eaten alive or starve to death, it's very unlikely that you'd accrue enough welfare to outweigh the badness of death. This is the basic argument for wild animal suffering predominating welfare. Most animals live short lives, with the main source of enjoyments being food and drink, and then die painfully. In such brief lives, they don't have enough welfare to outweigh the badness of death. Just like you wouldn't trade an extra week of life for even ten minutes of torture, these animals don't have enough welfare to outweigh the badness of their deaths—often gradual and drawn out affairs. I find this basic argument quite persuasive, but there are a number of objections to it. Thus, I thought in this article I'd rebut all the major objections. If I am correct, the conclusions are dramatic; the world is filled with horrific suffering. If nearly every creature who has ever lived experiences a hellish existence that you'd be wrong to wish on your worse enemy, you should support diminishing wild animal populations. It is bad to sustain the conditions that bring more creatures into hell! We are biased against this conclusion. Because we only see pretty and sublime nature, and live cushy lives infinitely better than wild animals, we can scarcely fathom just how bad life is for nearly every creature who has ever lived. In addressing the objections, I'll first quote my summary of them, and then explain why I disagree. But animals value being alive!Animals, in typical circumstances, value being alive and want to continue being alive. Thus, some people argue that this means their lives are mostly positive. This argument, however, is extremely dubious. An animal can have a net negative life but want to continue living. In theory, a creature could experience an arbitrarily large amount of suffering yet still want to live. This doesn't tell us whether its life is good. It would certainly be wrong to bring a creature into existence if it experienced arbitrarily vast amounts of torture but never wanted to die. Most animals don't understand suicide. They don't grasp death or realize it's an option. You can't use the fact that a creature doesn't kill itself as evidence it has a nice life if it doesn't understand suicide. That's like taking the fact that someone doesn't leave a play as evidence that they're enjoying it, even if they don't know that there are any exits. The basic argument for net negative wild-animal welfare comes primarily from the badness of their painful deaths. It could very well be that animals' existences are mostly nice, but their deaths are painful enough to outweigh them (if you get tortured for the last ten minutes of a day, most of the day could be pleasant, but that doesn't mean the day overall is pleasant). Lots of badness can be concentrated into just a brief period of time. Evolution, for obvious reasons, strongly programs animals not to want to commit suicide. Those that commit suicide can't pass on their genes. Thus, we should expect simple animals not to commit suicide no matter how miserable they are. The simple animals are barely conscious—of the significantly conscious animals, most have nice lives. Another objection claims that though most animals have bad lives, they're mostly not very conscious. Fish, for instance, probably don't have very intense pain. Of the creatures that have lives that matter significantly, most are longer-lived. First of all, the factual premise is likely wrong. Fish very likely feel pain (~80% confidence) and probably insects and other arthropods mostly do as well (~60% confidence). In fact, there are various strong theoretical reasons to suspect they might feel pain including: When these animals face negative stimuli, they behave as if they're in a lot of pain. A lobster being boiled in a pot struggles with all its might. It looks like you or I might look if we were boiled in a pot. When fish are in pain, they rock back and forth, rub their injured area, and struggle in exactly the way one would expect if they were in intense pain. When flies are given capsaicin (the chemical that makes food spicy, which most animals find very unpleasant to eat) laced food, they pull at their mouths, thrash around, and even go so far as to starve themselves to death.1 This behavior certainly doesn't seem like how one feels when only in mild discomfort. Evolution would program animals to experience lots of pain during death, because a dead organism can't pass on its genes. The evolutionary function of pain is to teach organisms a lesson (e.g. avoid predators because they'll hurt you). But simpler organisms with simpler cognitive architecture might thus need more pain to be taught a lesson. During the most intense kinds of human experiences, pain envelops the totality of what we experience. But for a simple animal, intense pain by default takes in the totality of its experience. This is one reason why pain in simple organisms might be more intense (in humans, when someone's cortex is rendered largely non-functional, sometimes they feel vastly more intense pain). Historically, humans have underestimated the sentience of others. Until the 1980s, it was commonly thought that babies and dogs weren't conscious. Thus, there's a decent probability we're underestimating consciousness in other animals, even simple ones. While we normally assume that animals with simple brains don't feel very intensely, it's not clear what justifies that assumption. Certainly if a human responded aversively the way animals do but had serious brain damage that made their brain much simpler, we wouldn't automatically confidently assume they didn't feel intense pain. Plausibly how bad pain is depends partially on relative signal intensity. The most intense pain occurs when the main stimulus the brain is processing is pain—others are drowned out. But for simple organisms, pain is often the only signal their brains take in. Various surprisingly robust behavior can be achieved with only a simple brain. Simple creatures can have a fairly robust visual cortex—creatures with 1/100,000th the neurons that we have don't have 1/100,000th the ability to see. What reason is there to be confident that pain is any different? And note, even if you have uncertainty about pain in simple creatures, they're so numerous that nearly all the world's pain is had by simple creatures. The most detailed report ever done on this subject estimated that even simple animals likely felt pain within an order of magnitude or two as intensely as we do (read the report for defenses of their methodology or see my defense of it here). Even if one goes with lower-end estimates of pain in fish in arthropods and fish, nearly all suffering in the world is likely to be had by fish and arthropods. Given considerable uncertainty, nearly all expected very intense suffering in the world is had by simple creatures. Even if one were outlandishly certain that fish and arthropods aren't conscious, amphibians and reptiles most certainly are, as even skeptical scientists tend to admit. Thus, even on maximally skeptical assumptions, most animals would be R-strategists! Hell, even if you thought only mammals were conscious, you'd still end up concluding that most animals ever born were R-strategists. Thus, on any reasonable weighting, nearly all the expected suffering and welfare in the world is experienced by small animals like fish and insects. Statistically, larger vertebrates are a rounding error even on generous assumptions. How do we know what animals experience? They're so different from us. It's true, of course, that animals are very different from us. This should be cause for humility and uncertainty. But if a creature lives a week and then dies painfully, and behaves when it's dying as if it's in extreme pain, then the most reasonable assumption is that it lived a bad life. The same evolutionary pressures that make death unpleasant in humans also make death unpleasant in animals. Also, even if you're uncertain about whether suffering predominates in nature, given the sheer amount of possible suffering, you should be hesitant about expanding nature. Mathematical models show that under certain assumptions, animals in nature live good lives.In an early paper, Ng produced a mathematical model showing animals lived mostly net-negative lives. Zach Groff updated this model, showing that when one does the math correctly, whether animals live good lives or not depends on various factual assumptions. Thus, he concludes we should be uncertain about net animal welfare. I don't think that highly oversimplified models tell us very much about animal life, particularly given how assumption dependent they are. If I'm trying to figure out if a baby who lives a week and then starves to death had an overall positive life, the way I should do that isn't by constructing a model of the evolutionary function of pleasure and pain. Instead, it's by seeing what happened in its life and making an assessment. If you know that nearly every animal ever born lives a week or so of constant struggle and then dies painfully, your judgment of whether they had a nice life shouldn't be much affected by your assessment of context-sensitive formal models. In addition, Groff's model suggests that under some assumptions, animals with shorter lives will generally have less evolutionary effort spent making them feel intense pain. But we don't have to speculate: we can just look at how intensely animals seem, based on their behavior, to suffer before death. The answer is: quite a lot! Behaviorally, even simple animals like fish behave like they're in very intense pain shortly before death! For the record, I think Groff agrees with this. He says in a comment: I agree that this sort of argument deserves relatively low epistemic weight and that the argument is very speculative, as I tried to emphasize in the paper but am worried that not everybody picked up.The core intuition behind the argument seems to be that if most creatures will die shortly after birth, then it makes less sense to spend a lot of resources making sure they feel lots of pain. If you are going to make 100,000 model cars, you won't invest too many resources in any one of them. But this on its own doesn't blunt the core argument because: It might be very evolutionarily cheap to produce pain. It may be that even simple organisms can feel lots of pain (see above for reasons to think that). Even simple creatures can have pretty robust abilities to see and hear. To give an analogy from Bjorn Merker, even simple DNA structures can self-replicate—it's plausible that pain can be aptly sustained in simple creatures. Especially because there's strong empirical evidence that neuron count doesn't correlate robustly with intensity of experience. It may be that more complicated brains produce more muted responses to pain. A more complicated brain might be able to richly modulate pain, to make pain signals less intense and more calibrated. Just as a defective radio might make a loud and hideous sound, it might be that a simple animal has less well-calibrated pain signals, and instead just feels unfiltered very intense pain. On this assumption, simpler animals might feel more pain than more complicated animals. The same factors that lead to diminished pain should also, it seems, lead to diminished pleasure. If animals don't evolve much pain capacity, because most pain signals are wasted, then it would also be inefficient for them to derive much pleasure capacity (because most pleasure is wasted). My understanding is that the response to this is that if pain and pleasure signals are costly, then they'll be developed later—but as far as I can tell, there isn't evidence that vastly greater ability to experience pleasure develops later in life. Overall, I just don't think it makes sense to put much weight in a model as speculative as this, when the thing it implies seems to run directly contrary to behavior in various organisms. The best evidence concerning how much pain fish feel when they die is not broad, evolutionary considerations, but behavioral and physiological evidence for profound stress and panic in fish who die. Death doesn't take very long.Some, like Michael Plant and Kyle York, have noted that death doesn't take very long while adults can live long pleasant lives. If a creature lives a year, and then dies painfully, even if its death takes 10 minutes, only about one fifty-thousandth of its life will be spent dying. Presumably, then, the pleasure it gets in the rest of its life can offset. However: Even if this were true, extreme suffering is bad enough that it can be tens of thousands of times more significant than ordinary life. If you offered me an extra month of life, that would culminate in me being slowly boiled alive for a minute, it's not clear that the month of life would contain enough pleasure to offset—even though ten minutes is only about one fifty-thousandth of a month. Extreme suffering can be tens of thousands of times more intense than mild suffering. Look at some of the ways that animals die in nature, even ones that take only a few minutes, and ask yourself: how many days of happy life would you give up to not have to experience it? For me, it would certainly be at least in the thousands. It's easy to underestimate intense pain's badness when it's remote and far away—when it's present, I think most people would give up many years of happy life to make it stop. Nearly all animals are very short lived—insects and fish. If a creature lives a week and then dies painfully, even if its death takes ten minutes (predation is usually shorter, starvation and dehydration are longer) then still a full .1% of its life is spent dying painfully. Certainly I would not trade a week of life for having to spend ten minutes being boiled alive—and my life is much nicer than the life of the average animal. And even of the fish larvae that reach the point when they're probably conscious, well over 99% starve to death or get eaten alive within their first few days of life. The picture is even more dismal if we assign even non-trivial probability to sentience in early larval stage (though that is controversial). Relying on York's numbers, it looks like for every batch of egg-laying, about a third as much time is spent in the process of actively dying—starving or being eaten alive—as is lived by adult fish. Adjusting for sentience, by conservative estimates, about 540 trillion years of adult fish consciousness go by annually, and about 190 trillion years of pain experience while actively dying occur annually. Given that the pain of death is likely hundreds or thousands of times more intense than the pleasure of ordinary existence, to my mind, this makes quite clear the case for most fish having negative lives. Most of them die very shortly after birth in a way that is very painful. A more reasonable estimate looks like the following—fish lay on average about 1 million eggs (this is conservative, because some like tuna lay vastly more). 2% become larvae, and 10% of those become conscious. Thus, for every adult fish who reproduces (if we assume to make the math easy that two are needed, ignoring hermaphrodites) there are ~1000 fish that die in the larval stage after becoming conscious. If adult fish live around a year, and it takes a day for a larval fish to die on average (probably most starve to death which takes multiple days), then about three times as much time is spent dying while conscious in the larval stage than as adults. Probably from this about 10 fish progress past the larval stage, and eight of them die before reproducing, likely after just a few weeks. (I'll put the more full calculation in a footnote, which adds up to about 1.8 times as much time spent dying as being an adult).2 If the amount of time a species spends starving to death is commensurate with the amount of time it spends living as an adult, its life is not overall worth living! If the human population spent about a third as much time starving to death as living as adults, humans would not have overall positive lives. And as we've just seen, by the estimate that strikes me as more reasonable, probably more time is spent starving to death than being an adult fish. Of all the moments of conscious life experienced by fish, a substantial portion, maybe about 10%, is spent starving to death. Often death takes quite a while, if it is from starvation, dehydration, or disease. Some animals, for instance, are eaten alive from the inside by parasites. Even aside from death, given the constant struggle of life, I'd guess most animals' everyday lives aren't very pleasant. Doesn't concern about this assume utilitarianism? No! Extreme suffering is bad. It's bad to be eaten alive, ripped apart by predators, and to starve to death. Utilitarianism has not cornered the market on thinking extreme suffering is bad. Even if you're a non-utilitarian, you should be concerned that there are biological systems that create short-lived animals who experience intense suffering—just like you'd be concerned if a machine created 10 billion puppies and left them all to starve to death. Have some empathy; any sane calculation will hold that a creature desperately trying to escape from unbearable agony—being ripped limb from limb by predators—is ethically serious. If you would give anything to make it stop if it was done to you, you should try hard to make sure it doesn't happen to others! Nature is a deeply cruel place. Most animals live short lives and die painfully. We should regard this situation as tragic and support actions that bring fewer animals—especially insects—into existence. I would not want to be born as an insect or fish, struggle for a few days, and then be eaten alive. If offered the chance to experience the life of every conscious creature on Earth so far, I would confidently turn it down. But if you find an insect's life unpleasant enough that you wouldn't choose it over non-existence, you shouldn't support creating huge numbers of insects that live their lives rather than non-existence. You shouldn't force unto others an experience that you yourself would be wise not to endure. The jury is still out on this conclusion to some degree. It's certainly possible that animals in nature mostly live pleasant lives. But overall, I think this is fairly unlikely. Most likely, wild animal suffering outweighs wild animal welfare by quite a sizeable margin. (The article below discusses in more detail what we should do about this tragic situation, and see here for explanations of why the views according to which we should preserve nature even if animals mostly live miserable lives make no sense.)1If genetically modified to have capsaicin receptors. 2For the more full calculation: assume conservatively that adult fish are 1.5 times as likely to be conscious as the later stage fish I previously assumed were conscious. Let's say they have a 75% chance of consciousness and the later stage larvae (called precocial larvae) have a 50% chance of consciousness. Assume additionally that the larvae I previously counted as non-conscious (altricial larvae) have a 10% chance of being conscious. Now, York assumed it takes larvae ten seconds to die because they have a feeding pouch. But that seems conservative because: 1) some probably suffocate; 2) some probably still starve; and 3) parasites might kill them. Even if only one in a thousand starve, this will majorly skew the 10 second numbers. For this reason, assume that they take on average 10 minutes to die. Taking this into account, per adult fish there are 500,000 eggs. From this, there are 10,000 altricial larvae that take 10 minutes to die. Then, there are 1,000 precocial larvae who take about a day to die. Adjusting for sentience, we get 3/4 of a year of conscious adult fish life among the fish who survive long enough to reproduce, 500 days (about 1.37 years) of precocial larvae death which typically occurs a few days after sentience, and ~6 days of death among the altricial larvae. Overall, about 1.8 times as much time is spent dying as a juvenile as living as an adult. If rather than taking into account time, we simply take into account number of individuals and adjust for probability of sentience, out of 500,000 eggs, then in expectation about 1,000 individuals die in the altricial stage, 500 die in the larval stage, 10 progress past the larval stage, and one goes on to reproduce. This means that of the expected conscious individuals born, probably about .67% don't die almost immediately as larvae, and even of the lucky .67%, most die shortly after.",

In other words: forward-minded nerds are not into the cutting-edge technology they themselves make while the self-serious literary crowd dips on it. How can we reconcile this paradox?(Disclaimer: the former is anecdotal evidence from someone I trust; a \"shocking number\" doesn't necessarily mean \"most\" researchers and probably doesn't. The latter comes from a statistical calculation on a sample of 2,000 writers; I will henceforth take both as faithful inferences of the current state of affairs.)Let's start with the core question of this essay: Why are those building AI ignoring it? And some question-responses: Are the tools not good enough? Are researchers confident that AI can't improve their output? Are they jealously guarding their skills? Are they so good at their job that AI is a net negative? Are they lazy? Stubborn? Liars?Coming from the author of \"I'm Losing All Trust in the AI Industry,\" those questions seem framed, but I'm genuinely puzzled. I use ChatGPT myself for work all the time. To an optimist like me—as much as I'm annoyed by the constant hype and wary of the decision-makers—AI researchers not using AI is weird. The only reason it is not outright suspicious is that this pattern goes beyond AI; it's so pervasive that it's actually a proverb.We Spaniards say, \"En casa de herrero, cuchillo de palo\" (literally, \"in the smith's house, a wooden knife\"). Most cultures and languages have some version of the idea. The French say \"Les cordonniers sont toujours les plus mal chaussés,\" which translates to \"Shoemakers always wear the worst shoes.\" The English analogous is also about bad footwear: \"The shoemaker's children go barefoot.\" (Poor shoemakers, they're made an example of in nearly 80% of the countries I checked.) The Japanese have one: isha-no fuyōjō (physician, heal thyself). The indians have one (Hindi/Urdu): chirāg tale andherā (there's darkness under the lamp). The Persians have one: kuze-gar az kuze šekaste âb mi-xorad (the potter drinks water from broken pots).

I'll be posting about one of these a week for several months. When you've read them all, I'll ask you to vote for a favorite, so remember which ones you liked]When the prefect of Alexandria's daughter converted to Christianity, nothing in particular happened - it wasn't as though the laws outlawing the cult would be enforced against her. She was smart, she was pretty (beautiful, even) and she had connections. So long as she kept quiet, Catherine could have a comfortable life.This comfortable, maybe?She didn't keep quiet. When the Emperor arrived in Alexandria for a festival, this festival included gladiatorial games and chariot races and feasting and drinking, and, of course, the best part - feeding Christians to lions. The prefect's daughter telling the Emperor he was wrong to feed Christians to lions might have been pardonable softheartedness if it was just that she disliked watching slaves fed to lions, but her telling him that he was wrong because the Christians were right and he was wrong was flatly unacceptable. He had no more interest in offending her parents than anyone else, though (and, in fact, he was considering putting his wife aside and marrying her - a useful alliance and she had brains and guts) so instead he called on his top fifty philosophers to outargue her.Instead she converted half of them to Christianity, so he had to have them killed. That was the point where he threw her in prison, hoping she'd change her mind and be sensible. Instead she converted everyone who showed up to argue with her in prison; when he deprived her of food she was fed by a dove, when he had her tortured her wounds miraculously healed. When his wife tried to talk sense into her, she converted and the Emperor had to have her killed, too, so since the slot was empty he, as a final try, proposed marriage to Catherine. She told him she had a better husband - Christ - and at that insult he condemned her to death. The first try failed when the breaking wheel shattered at her touch; the second try employed an axe, but though the blade struck true milk flowed from the stump instead of blood.Except that this story is almost certainly fiction. Our oldest source is six hundred years after the events it chronicles and therefore should not remotely be trusted as fact. These stories grow in the telling, more and more miracles added with every retelling to the point where some people question whether St. Catherine even existed. When our sources are good they look like the Venerable Bede's Life of St. Cuthbert, chronicling how he saw visions of angels, prophesied the future and also controlled the weather, which Bede based on a single chronicle written down within twenty years of the death of St. Cuthbert. This is to say that if we are lucky we got it thirdhand. (We are rarely lucky.)A saintly teenage girl who outargues a roomful of philosophers with no training, merely divine inspiration, is absurd. There's no chance at all that such a saint might have existed, let alone been interviewed by a team of experts (under oath) about her entire life, and of course if this team of experts did interview her they would no doubt end up concluding she was a fraud, though of course we can't expect them to mail copies1 of the interview to every monarch in Europe to prove it.And definitely nobody would ever, ever be so angry at irregularities in the first interview that they would try to themselves interview everyone she'd ever met2 about her (still under oath) and mail a copy of the updated and revised version to every monarch in Europe to prove that all her miracles actually happened.Meet Jeanne d'Arc, Maid of Orleans. Yes, yes, she defeated an invincible army and is a feminist hero and also one of the national saints of France, fine. More importantly, Joan of Arc is documented! She's a miracle-working saint who has evidence! She might have more evidence than any other non-monarch before the printing press! This is, then, an agnostic's review of the evidence3 for Joan of Arc - artillerist, fraudbuster, confirmed saint, and Extremely Documented Person.(The reams and reams of documents are there, they're just invisible. Trust me.)Let's start with the legend of Joan of Arc: A poor peasant girl in France is chosen by God, goes to fight the English, defeats them in a series of battles while performing random miracles, is captured by them and burned as a witch, The End. Maybe you add the epilogue about how eventually the Church made her a saint. All completely impossible and all guaranteed to be nonsense.The funny thing is the extent to which it isn't.Around 1412, a female child \"named Jean or Jeanette\" was born in the tiny village of Donremy, on the marches of Lorraine in eastern France. She appears to have had half the village as her godparents, based on the number of people who testified later. This many godparents wasn't actually unusual - the job of godfather or godmother was half \"it takes a village to raise a child\" and half \"witness that this person actually exists\" - but it helpfully means that we know more about the birth of Joan of Arc than we do about the birth of Alexander.4She grew up in an ordinary way. She was quiet and pious and... quiet... and... pious. It didn't matter which side was asking questions about her, people had real trouble coming up with other things to say about her! A few stories leak through, though, about her being more than the normal kind of pious. Her village priest reported that she bribed him with wool to stop slacking off at his job; she occasionally snuck off from her work to spend extra time in church; she gave a great deal of alms. The most extraordinary event in her life was when a man sued her for breach of promise of marriage, which is the opposite of what usually happens; in an interesting piece of foreshadowing, she successfully defended herself in court by claiming that she had made no such promise. It was not a very remarkable life.Then she ran off to save the country from the English because God told her to, which is the step that requires some explaining. Why did the country need saving?Part One: \"That brought great harm to the kingdom of France.\"The first thing you need to understand that France is cursed.According to legend5, this curse was incurred by Philip the Fair6, King of France around 1300, when he had the Knights Templar abolished and all the officers of the order burned for heresy so he wouldn't have to pay back his debts.7 From the flames, the last Grandmaster of the order cursed him with his dying breath that he would \"see him before God's tribunal before the year was out\" and Philip duly died within the year. His sons would follow him, and their sons, each in inexorable succession passing the crown to the next before dying in turn. The last of the Capet princes managed to make it almost fifteen years past Philip's death before succumbing to that old favorite, \"unknown causes.\"8This produced a succession crisis. The two available candidates to succeed him were the Duke of Guyenne, son of Philip the Fair's daughter Isabella,9 and the Count of Orleans, son of Philip the Fair's brother Charles of Valois. Since the Duke of Guyenne was Edward III, King of England, and the Count of Orleans wasn't, the choice was obvious and France declared that the law had always been that the throne could never pass through a woman. Edward III was sixteen, in England, and busy, so he raised no meaningful objection, and Philip of Valois, called \"The Fortunate\" because he got to be king, inherited. Twelve years later, Philip eyed Guyenne, the last bit of France left in English hands from Eleanor of Aquitaine's inheritance, and, observing the English busy in Scotland, he made his move.This was unwise. It had been a reasonable decision to attack Edward II, inept, oppressive, and so devoted to his favorites his lords had plotted his murder; Edward III took after his grandfathers on both sides, conquerors both, and what he had been busy with during his French grandfather's death was plotting a coup against his regents. At age seventeen he imprisoned his mother, murdered her lover10 and invaded Scotland. After a decade or so the Scots wars pulled the French in - the Auld Alliance was not so Auld back then but it existed - and since the French wanted to get Guyenne back, why not?The answer was, as it happened, that the Edwards first and third had spent the past sixty years building the most professional army in Europe. England, like the rest of post-Roman Europe, had been founded on a military basis of feudal levies, with each vassal providing soldiers at his expense to fight alongside the king's personal retinue. These soldiers could be called out for long enough to stop marauding Vikings but not for much longer, so any attempt to raise an army for even a single year's campaign required agonizing negotiations with each individual leader and, worse, meant that the troops were all either sullen conscripts or proud knights eager for glory and jealous of their honor. These knights might fight like the devil - as everyone from Greece to Egypt to Tunis had learned to their cost - but leading these men was like herding cats.In England, however, the practice of scutage (nobles paying money to get out of raising troops) had arisen, and also in England there existed that fantastically useful tool of kings for raising money, the English Parliament.11 With the combination of carrot - redress of grievances - and stick - pay or I'll impose costs on you perfectly legally - augmented by the patriotic pride of Englishmen who might not want to kill Frenchmen themselves but really wanted the Frenchmen dead, Edward collected money and used it to pay professionals drawn from England and Wales, and these professionals fought.The English army was never large, somewhere between seven thousand and fifteen thousand men at its height.12 Even the Scots could muster more soldiers - but the Scots army was largely lightly-armored and poorly-trained spearmen and bowmen, and the English were all armored and well-armed, with plenty of time to train and no loyalties running against their loyalties to their king and their pay, and when well-led they demolished the Scots.This was the army that landed in France. Since France had about five times as many people in it as England, this army was wildly outnumbered. The chroniclers describe the French army as variously seventy-two thousand or a hundred and twenty thousand men - to hysterical laughter from modern historians, who think they only had twenty or thirty thousand - but it was clear that when the armies met it would inevitably be a slaughter.It was. In the other direction. The King of France raised his levies, called up the royal knights, hired mercenaries, invited in allies. All mustered beneath the Oriflamme, the sacred banner of Charlemagne, and this massive army went to catch the English, the English backed off rapidly while looking for defensive terrain, the French pushed on, the English started planting stakes and caltrops, the French attacked - and the English massacred them.The English, you see, had the longbow.The Welsh longbow had made it to England under the first Edward; it's a simple weapon, cheap to make, useful for hunting, and if you get good with it you can put a 37-inch arrow through chainmail. Its effectiveness has been exaggerated by patriotic historians - modern research13 suggests that even at short range it couldn't go through the best-made breastplates in Europe - but patriotic historians can exaggerate anything, horses didn't wear heavy armor, and the accuracy and rate of fire of the longbow would not be surpassed until the repeating rifle,14 15 five hundred years later. The battle started with an archery duel between the English archers and Genoese crossbowmen, then believed to be the best long-range specialists in Europe, who were driven from the field and then ridden down by their own furious employers16 as they charged furiously into the face of the English army, and managed no better. By the time the French knights reached the English lines, their horses were dead and they'd be suffering from all sorts of minor17 wounds and they would have been repeatedly punched in the torso with longbow arrows, which if it happens to you is going to leave you bruised and exhausted even if your armor is good enough to stop the projectile. Then the English men-at-arms, still fresh, killed the French until they routed.The French, naturally, put together another army, which was beaten in almost exactly the same way at Poitiers. Again and again it repeated itself - Agincourt, Verneuille, Aljubarrota18 and dozens of minor fights - and every one of them was, in essence, a repeat of Crecy. Minor variations occurred - at Poitiers the French attacked on foot, at Verneuille they detached troops to attack the English baggage train - but these didn't help.The French were saved from immediate disaster by three things. The first was the Black Death, which killed a third of Europe. This had effects wildly beyond the scope of our story but also demolished the tax bases of every state in Europe. This shrunk the size of armies and thereby as an incidental side effect meant that all existing castles were heavily overbuilt, since they were intended to defend against half again the force that would actually be present, which slowed the pace of war tremendously.The second was a strategy adopted by the French kings in which they did not fight the English. They would just let the English field army march wherever it liked and loot and burn whatever it liked, and meanwhile their troops would be burning and pillaging everywhere the English held and the English field army wasn't. This was extremely unpopular among the people being pillaged, but the English did run out of money before the French ran out of castles and that meant the French could go around taking English castles in France while the English army was in England.And the third was that the English army depended on good leadership, and when Edward III died the English wouldn't have it for another forty years, until Henry V took the throne. This two-generation timeskip provided enough time for the population to partially replenish and also for the French to completely forget Lesson Two, an error of memory which produced Agincourt.Agincourt was the standard model of battle - Henry V \"made it his course to busy the minds of his people with foreign quarrels\", to misquote Shakespeare, landed an army in Normandy and went around taking and besieging towns. When the French went up to engage him, Henry attempted to withdraw, took up a position on good ground and when the French attacked the English broke them utterly. Halfway through the battle the order was given to kill the prisoners instead of holding them for ransom, and so the battle was not merely a defeat for the French, but a disaster, with a generation's worth of military leaders dead in a single day.19And then they all died.The disaster was made worse by the fact that the French nobility at the time of Agincourt was trapped in an internal feud that was rapidly coming to resemble civil war. Between the time of the battles of Crecy and of Poiters, Philip the Fortunate had given the rich duchy of Burgundy in fief to his faithful son Philip the Bold, but Philip was faithful to his father, not to France. As the years rolled on and the throne of France passed from Philip the Fortunate to his son and grandson, the interests of the Dukes of Burgundy began to diverge from those of the Kings of France, and so in the age of the long truce the bold Dukes of Burgundy won lands through conquest and through marriage until their wealth and power nearly matched that of their ostensible monarchs. Under the three great Dukes of Burgundy who ruled in sequence, their realm became the leading state of the Renaissance, the continent's greatest sponsor of art and music and the true cultural heartland of Europe.20But all these accomplishments had been won by the power of the Kingdom of France, which during the pause in the Hundred Years' War had cheerfully spent men and treasure conquering and protecting these lands for the Burgundians, allowing them to spend their treasure on paintings and sculptures and dance manuals. The Kingdom of France had done this not by the will of the King of France (Charles VI, Philip the Fortunate's grandson), who at that time was seriously mentally ill21 and who the year before his regency started had murdered several people in a paranoid fit and afterwards took to believing that he was made of glass and would shatter if he fell, but through the decision of his regent, one Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy.Naturally, Philip had opponents at court who objected to his abuse of the treasury for his private purposes. They wanted to abuse the treasury for their private purposes, and it simply wasn't fair that Uncle Philip got to monopolize it all! The head of this party was Philip the Bold's nephew and Charles the Mad's brother, Louis of Orleans, but for some bizarre reason his party was called the Armagnacs.22 Louis took advantage of a moment of lucidity on his brother's part to get the regency, but was dismissed for corruption23 and then when he continued to cross the Burgundians, murdered - but he had a son who inherited the blood feud and the two sides took advantage of the long truce in the war with England to go at it hammer and tongs, riots alternating with coups interspersed with outright field battles. Commoners and nobles alike rallied to one side or the other, and loyal Frenchmen could consider either faction to be the lesser evil. When Henry V invaded, the Armagnacs had happened to be in control of the government, and so their leaders had been at the battle of Agincourt and few escaped. The Burgundians were faced with a foreign invasion on the one hand and domestic strife on the other, so John the Fearless, then Duke of Burgundy, offered the Armagnacs an end to the feud and an alliance against the English, conditional on the Armagnacs yielding the regency to the Burgundian faction. The Armagnacs agreed. The two sides met to discuss terms, and then - with Henry V and his army rampaging around Normandy, taking towns at will! - the chiefs of the Armagnac faction had John the Fearless murdered in retaliation for Louis's earlier murder.This is fine.This was an act that made no political sense, an act that could only really be justified by blood vengeance, and the Burgundians, understandably, snapped. They held Paris by that point and with it physical control of the King and the Queen, and there was an army that had just taken Rouen that was available to their service if they had the wit to use it.Charles the Mad played no particular role in the Anglo-French treaty that resulted. The key figures were Henry V of England, who intended not merely to reclaim Normandy but to press his great-grandfather's claim to the French throne; Philip the Good of Burgundy, who had a blood feud to pursue; and Isabeau of Bavaria, Queen of France, a ruthless and ambitious woman who probably deserved better than she got from history; she'd done a fine job playing the political game and trying to keep her family alive during the Armagnac-Burgundian Feud, but by this point she was all out of cards. The treaty said that Henry V would wed Charles's daughter, that Isabeau of Bavaria would swear that the Dauphin24 Charles (an Armagnac) was no son of the king's but the product of an incestuous25 affair between her and Louis of Orleans, and since that meant they were all out of male descendants of Charles the Mad, why, Henry would serve as regent for him and inherit through his own wife when he died.At that point the dominoes fell fast. The Armagnacs, under the (exceedingly poor) leadership of the Dauphin Charles and his (exceedingly inept) advisors, now the rump state of France, tried to fight multiple times; they called on Scotland for aid and got it and called on Castille and didn't.26 Every time they tried to fight they were beaten and Henry (now \"The Conqueror\") rolled down France, taking castles one by one and installing loyal members of the Burgundian party - now the collaborators' party - as governors. It looked as though the Hundred Years' War would soon be over.Then Charles the Mad died. Then Henry the Conqueror died. The new King of England, son of Henry and his newlywed queen, was not yet one year old.Now was a moment of opportunity, but the Armagnacs were in no position to take it. The battle of Verneuil, when they had the aid of the Scots, took place two years after the death of the two kings,27 and even though the Scots knew how to fight Englishmen the French and their allies were as beaten as ever. Henry's government rested in the hands of his brother, the Duke of Bedford, and if Bedford was not quite his brother's equal it was only because very few men could be. The Armagnacs were despised by the population at large as corrupt and murderous, and the educated, cultured classes looked towards Burgundy as the sole hope of France and thereby accepted the necessity that the reign of the Valois kings was over. Some villages supported the Armagnacs as the lesser of two evils, others were pro-Burgundian, and bands of men-at-arms under any authority or none wandered the country, pillaging as they pleased. The most despised of them were the English army, the goddams, respecters of no property and of no religion,28 not speaking the French language or feeling the slightest mercy for the French people. South of the Loire river, the country was Armagnac to the extent it was anything; north it was Burgundian, and the key crossing lay at the city of Orleans, with an English army besieging it in spite of every relief effort the inept Dauphin could put together.This was the state of France - leaderless, beaten, disorganized, a country that would need a miracle if it was going to survive.Then it got one.Part Two: The Life of Joan of Arc2.1: \"There lives a maid between Coussey and Vaucouleurs that will see the King crowned within a year.\"When Joan was thirteen, she started hearing voices.29The voices told her that she should be good and remember to always go to church and obey her parents, which I understand is not exactly the default thing for hallucinations to tell you to do, though they are, of course, culture-dependent. She reported they were angels, that they came with a great light, that they came from the direction of the church, and that they were often accompanied by a sweet (or good) smell. She had not had a very eventful life and no one particularly noticed; her father had bad dreams that she'd go run off and join the army, which can be put down to the perfectly normal worries of a father for his daughter, considering the men-at-arms; her family were partisans of the Armagnac faction, so far as we can tell on the grounds that they weren't collaborators, and she mostly spent her time helping her mother in the house.When she was fifteen:[The] voice told me, twice or thrice a week, that I, Joan, must go away and that I must come to France30 and that my father must know nothing of my leaving. The voice told me that I should go to France and I could not bear to stay where I was. The voice told me that I should raise the siege laid to the city of Orleans... And me, I answered it that I was a poor girl who knew not how to ride nor lead in war.31She was sixteen when she took action, going from her village with her uncle to the Armagnac-held town of Vaucouleurs to tell the commander of the garrison, Robert de Baudricourt, that God had sent her to save the kingdom of France and that it was the will of the King of Heaven that she be delivered safely to Bourges, where the Dauphin Charles was, and could he please provide her with a horse, a sword, men's clothes and an armed escort? He sent her home with instructions for her uncle to beat her more so she'd stop running off. She, undaunted, returned after a few months, and this time Robert sent her away but for... some reason... let her stay in Vaucouleurs, instead of sending her back to her family again.32This gave her the opportunity to hit everyone in town with Charisma 18 Diplomacy checks.I [Jean de Metz, a squire] spoke to her, saying, 'My dear girl, what are you doing here? Must it not be that the King be cast out of the kingdom and we become English?' And the Maid answered me, 'I am come here to a King's Chamber' (i.e., to a royalist place) 'to talk with Robert de Baudricourt that he may be willing to lead me or send me to the King, but he pays no attention to me nor to my words. And yet, before we are in mid-Lent, I must be at the King's side, though I wear my feet to the knees. For indeed there is nobody in all the world, neither king nor duke, nor daughter of the King of Scotland,33 nor any other who can recover the kingdom for France. And there will be no help (for the kingdom) if not from me. Although I would rather have remained spinning at my mother's side, for it is not my condition, yet must I go and must I do this thing, for my Lord wills that I do so.' I asked her who was her Lord. And she told me that it was God. Whereupon I, Jean, who bear witness here, promised the Maid, putting my hand in hers in a gesture of good faith, that, God helping, I would lead her to the King.So when she came to de Baudricourt the third time he had her exorcised.34 When that didn't stop her he said yes and either gave her or had crowdfunded for her everything she asked for - sword, horse, men's clothes, knight, squire (Jean de Metz, quoted above) and either four servants or three servants and an archer, depending on which source you prefer. The entire town chipped in to get her what she asked for, and de Baudricourt himself gave her a sword as she prepared to leave.It's not wholly clear why de Baudricourt did this. The state of affairs of the Armagnac faction was certainly desperate, and yes, there were rumors that \"it has been prophesied that France shall be lost by a woman and restored by a virgin from the Lorraine marches\"35 but really when you think about it, what are the odds it's this virgin? How does he even know she is a virgin? Even in the middle ages they knew most prophecies were fake, because you could go around just claiming anything you felt like was a prophecy. Maybe it's just charisma? That might explain what happened next, which is that the knight who took her had planned on raping her along the way, just on general principles,36 but somehow he... couldn't do it:Every night she lay down with Jean de Metz and me, keeping upon her her surcoat and hose, tied and tight. I was young then and yet I had neither desire nor carnal movement to touch woman, and I should not have dared to ask such a thing of Joan, because of the abundance of goodness which I saw in her.And so, dodging men-at-arms as they went on the assumption that they were probably hostile to everyone just by default, they made their way to the Dauphin's court.2.2: \"Thou art true heir of France and King's son.\"The story of her arrival at the Dauphin's temporary capital at Chinon is legendary. Even people who know very little about Joan of Arc have often heard about it; it's one of the most famous scenes of her life, a subject of paintings and stories. (Age of Empires II practically starts with it.) The story tells that Joan approached the Dauphin in a room full of fine lords and noblemen where he was dressed plainly, that he denied his identity and she persisted that he and he alone was the trueborn king of France, and by this sign of her gifts convinced all that she was a saint chosen by God to bring him victory.Or:\"Then, Joan, who was come before the King, made the bows and reverences customary to make to the King, as if she had been nurtured at court, and this greeting done said, addressing her speech to the King: 'God give you life, gentle King,' whereas she knew him not and had never seen him. And there were (present) several lords, dressed with pomp and richly and more so than was the King. Wherefore he answered the said Joan, 'Not I am the King, Joan.' And, pointing to one of his lords, said, 'There is the King.' To which she replied, 'By God, gentle prince, it is you and none other.' \"How can it be false if it's painted?Yeah, that probably never happened. Sure, sure, it's sourced to a contemporary French historian (Jean Chartier, quoted above) who we know had met the Dauphin a decade or two after his coronation and could very easily have talked to eyewitnesses and gotten the story from them, and so it's on a much better foundation than ninety-nine percent of what we believe about history. But we have eyewitnesses. Here's one:Raoul de Gaucourt, grand master of the King's household, eighty-five years of age or thereabouts: \"I was present in the castle and town of Chinon when the Maid arrived, and I saw her when she presented herself before the royal majesty, with much humility and great simplicity, the poor little shepherdess, and I heard the following words which she spoke to the King: 'Very noble Lord Dauphin, I am come and am sent by God, to bring succour to you and your kingdom.'No mention of the denial, no mention of the King's dress. Where did the story come from? The probable explanation lies in Joan's own testimony during her first trial by the English:[A]fter a meal I went to my King who was in the castle. When I entered my King's room, I knew him among the others by the counsel of my voice which revealed him to me. I told my King that I wanted to go and make war against the English.So if she's to be trusted her voices did indeed point him out - but if we're a cynic, she could have been guessing by his body language. Still, it's enough so that we can see the story growing from there.Either way, Charles was initially skeptical, but Joan addressed him as the true and rightful heir to the kingdom of France and then took him aside and gave him some sign, and this deeply rattled him. We aren't sure what the sign was; Joan told her interrogators that she had sworn an oath to keep the details secret and so she couldn't swear another one to tell the truth on this matter and that if the English wanted to know they could ask her King, and when they pressed her repeatedly to tell them the sign she gave her king she switched to making sarcastic comments, like \"the sign you need is for God to deliver me out of your hands, the most certain sign He could show you.\" Nor did any of her other contemporaries write down what the sign was.37 But whatever it was, it clearly rattled the Dauphin - he was sure she had access to some kind of magic, he just couldn't tell if it was white or black. Just as Robert de Baudricourt had ordered an exorcism, so the Dauphin Charles called for an examination and sent for the doctors of theology at the University of Poitiers to interview her, so that they could tell him if it was ethical to recruit her.Unfortunately, the record of the examination at Poitiers doesn't exist any more. It definitely existed then! Joan repeatedly tells her interrogators at the first trial \"That's in the book at Poitiers\" and one of her examiners survived to testify at the second (posthumous) trial, but unfortunately most medieval manuscripts don't exist any more and this is one of them. It would be an invaluable source if we had it, but all we've got left is what one elderly Dominican remembered at the second trial. One fragment is:\"Master Guillaume Aimeri interrogated her: 'Thou hast said that the voice told thee that God wishes to deliver the people of France from the calamities which afflict it. If he wishes to deliver it, it is not necessary to have men-at-arms.' Then Joan answered him: 'By God the men-at-arms will do battle and God will give victory.' With this answer Master Guillaume held himself satisfied...And we have their final conclusion, which was:\"That in her is found no evil, but only good, humility, virginity, devotion (devoutness), honesty, simplicity.\"Well, fair enough.And the elderly Dominican continues:\"We reported all that to the King's Council, and were of opinion that, given the imminent necessity and the peril in which the town of Orleans stood, the King could well use her help and send her to Orleans.I like this response because... One is not allowed to declare a living person a saint. The saints are the people in Heaven. According to Catholic theology, a living person might at any point use his God-given free will to do evil and not repent of it. This is therefore about as close as they can get, and it's pretty far!On the other hand, we all see the other side of the story, right? The desperate gambler who realizes that his stack's almost out and he might as well bet against the odds he'll make a flush, because probably he won't but if he folds he's out anyway, right?Since the Dauphin wasn't quite desperate enough to risk his soul to win, he also had her checked over by women of his wife's household to confirm that she was a virgin, both because of the belief at the time that virginity was the sign of sainthood and because if she's lying about that she's clearly just full of shit on every other topic, too. She passed the test, of course. Joan's opinion on the multipronged inquiry into her origins and character was that \"she was not pleased with all these interrogations and that they were preventing her from accomplishing the work for which she was sent and that the need and time were come to act.\"38 Once again: Fair enough.And it seems to be only at about this point that the Dauphin Charles has Joan given basic training in the arts of a soldier and of a captain, which she has never had the opportunity to get before.39 But he can't get her much of it, because she shows up in February or March and goes to the front in late April, giving about a month to teach her how to move in armor, fight with a sword, ride a warhorse, command infantry, command cavalry, command artillery.40 Fortunately, she appears to... already know most of this? Or something? Because, in the judgement of Joan's peers:Thiband d'Armagnac or de Termes, Knight, bailiff of Chartres: \"Except in matters of war, she was simple and innocent. But in the leading and drawing up of armies and in the conduct of war, in disposing an army for battle and haranguing the soldiers, she behaved like the most experienced captain in all the world, like one with a whole lifetime of experience.\"[The Duke d'Alencon, French nobleman and general]: \"In everything that she did, apart from the conduct of the war, Joan was young and simple, but in the conduct of war she was most skillful, both in carrying a lance herself, in drawing up the army in battle order, and in placing the artillery. And everyone was astonished that she acted with such prudence and clear-sightedness in military matters, as cleverly as some great captain with twenty or thirty years' experience; and especially in the placing of artillery, for in that she acquitted herself magnificently.\"[Marguerite La Touroulde, Joan's landlady at Chinon] \"And from all that I know of her she was absolutely ignorant except in the matter of arms. For I have seen her ride a horse and wield a lance as well as the finest soldier, and the soldiers themselves were most astonished by this.\"Dunois (Bastard of Orleans) gives up and flatly says that she's so good thatI believe that Joan was sent by God, and that her deeds in the war were the fruit of divine inspiration rather than of human agency. . . . And this is why:And then he gives one actual miracle as evidence (we'll get to that) and everything else is cases of her being so good at war thatI swear that the English, two hundred of whom had previously been sufficient to rout eight hundred or a thousand of the royal army, from that moment became so powerless that four or five hundred soldiers and men at arms could fight against what seemed to be the whole force of England.Dunois here is speaking from experience. The last time French and English forces had clashed in any serious way was about a year before Joan showed up at court, when the pride of the French army was defeated by a convoy of pickled herrings.41 Dunois was present at that debacle; he managed to dodge the blame and in fact from the Siege of Orleans up to, what, the mid-fifteenth century42 or so, he's one of the leading French generals. So he and d'Alencon can be considered expert testimony, and the expert testimony is that she is unfairly good.The Bastard of Orleans thinks that this isn't fair.This is where a lot of the conspiracy-theory stories about Joan really get started, because her \"riding a horse and wielding a lance as well as the finest soldier\" skills are patently ridiculous if they have ten years of training and she has one month, to say nothing about her command skills, so they claim she must've had advance training. But we're recounting the evidence here and saving our desperate attempts to come up with an explanation for a later section, so we can just recount the consensus and move on to what her leadership looked like.2.3: \"A Maid sent by God to drive out the English.\"It looked like charisma-enforced puritanism. d'Alencon, who is one of my favorite sources, recounts in the tone of a man missing a dear departed friend that Joan kept upbraiding him for his blasphemous swearing and he kept guiltily stopping whenever he noticed her in earshot. She made sure the soldiers all went to Mass regularly, drove those of the camp followers who wouldn't marry their men from camp with the flat of her sword43 and absolutely forbade looting and cruelty towards prisoners. She was not actually in charge of the army, but only of one company of troops; she was given arms and a banner (God upheld by angels blessing a fleur-de-lis) and a couple squires and a few hundred men to escort supplies into the city, but somehow before her force made it very far it was her force. She ruled less by royal or official authority than by the fact that before long everyone would do whatever she wanted because are you going to tell the Maid no? It started with only her own few hundred troops, but before long it spread to anyone in earshot of her voice.This was important because the transitional system of military organization used by the French in the early fifteenth century appears to be terrible. So far as I, who am not actually an expert on the fifteenth century, can tell, the system in use was that the essential person is the captain, who can be a royal appointee leading state troops, or a nobleman with his vassals or a mercenary leading his own employees (to the extent these are distinct categories), and who commands a force of, oh, three or four hundred men. If the king is present, he's in charge. Otherwise the Constable of France is in charge, when he isn't under strict orders to stay away from court due to a blood feud with one of the king's chief advisors;44 alternatively or if he happens to be absent, then the king can designate one of the captains as an overall commander,45 but in practice all captains are equals but the King and if the King is indecisive46 they solve all problems produced by a divided command by bickering, and we saw how well that worked at the Battle of the Herrings.When compared to this mess, Joan's system of command-by-charisma was a tremendous success, and even leaving aside the claims of miracles (and her implausible untrained artillery skills) we can see why. First, unlike earlier French armies, Joan's troops would neither charge nor rout without orders. Second, she'd given them a logical hypothesis for why they kept losing battles (they'd offended God), then changed the behavior that lead to it (no swearing, no fornication, no hurting the innocent) and so they should logically expect to start winning instead of losing.But also she kept doing miracles, and this terrified her contemporaries, Armagnac or Burgundian or English. Most of them are minor things - calming a horse with the Cross, hearing a soldier who would die in the next engagement blaspheming and saying \"do you swear, and you so near to death?\", predicting when she'd be injured in advance, not dying of infection when shot, telling the Duke d'Alencon \"move or you'll get hit by a cannonball,\" he moves and a couple of minutes later there's the cannonball47 killing someone else, and so forth and so on. And then there was the sword. Joan sent a letter to the town of Sainte-Catherine de Fierbois requesting that they kindly look behind (or under, she doesn't remember exactly what she said) the altar for a rusty sword with five crosses on the hilt, clean the rust off and send it to her. So they did. (We have reports of this from both Joan and the priest who mailed it to her.) Rumors that this was Joyeuse, the sword of Charlemagne, demonstrate decisively that there no lily that someone will not determinedly gild, but whatever the sword's provenance it became part of the legend of Joan of Arc.Her arrival at Orleans was also part of the legend. The English had built or taken a number of forts around the city and were bombarding it with their artillery, but they didn't have the numbers to completely encircle it and so when Joan arrived the siege was moving pretty slowly. Jean Dunois, Bastard of Orleans, was in charge of the city's defense, and he gave orders that her convoy of supplies and reinforcements enter the city by a circuitous route to avoid the English garrisons before riding out to join them. When he arrived Joan, metaphorically breathing fire, angrily demanded he explain why he'd ordered her troops redirected when the simplest solution was that they just sailed upriver. Dunois explained very patiently that, yes, the city's captains had taken counsel together and they had concluded that given that the wind was blowing in the wrong direction, the most sensible option was to avoid the risk of fighting the English and they thought that was best and safest -\"In God's name, the counsel of the Lord your God is wiser and safer than yours,\" said Joan.48Forthwith and as in the same moment, the wind which was contrary and absolutely prevented the boats from moving upstream, in which were laden the victuals for Orleans, changed and became favourable.So after the wind directly and miraculously reversed, Joan and her troops were able to enter the city. They held a parade (we have a journal from one of the burghers of Orleans, which is a Useful Eyewitness Source separate from the two trials), Joan went out under flag of truce to demand that the English surrender to God (and got laughed at),49and Dunois left to fetch even more reinforcements. Meanwhile Joan - stuck with Dunois nominally in charge and people unwilling to go attack in defiance of the commander-in-chief's orders - was firing up her troops. Dunois returned with his reinforcements and news that the English would be getting reinforcements of their own directly,50 and that night as she was drifting off to sleep Joan woke up her squire by loudly crying out. He muzzily rose and asked her what it was, and she said that her voices had told her to attack the English immediately but not where to do it!51 At which point they rushed out and discovered that there was a skirmish already underway and gathered all their forces to join it, swiftly turning it against the English and driving them from one of their forts...... After which she ordered that none of the prisoners be executed, and wept since so many of the English had died without confessing their sins, and so she made sure that on the next day (the feast of the Ascension) all the French troops took confession and avoided sinning.(It is after this skirmish that \"a valiant and notable knight\" whose name our source politely avoids mentioning suggests that maybe they should stop pushing their luck and call this good enough. \"You have been at your counsel and I at mine; and know that my Lord's counsel will be accomplished and will prevail and that that (other) counsel will perish,\" said Joan, and goes onwards with the next attack.)If you've only got a month's training, carrying a banner instead of a sword is just good sense.This set the tone for the rest of the siege - rapid French assaults on the English fortifications each independently as Joan's visions directed her, with the Maid's fanatical charisma to keep morale up. At the next major bastion the English repelled the French until Joan managed to get the fleeing French to turn and make another attack which actually succeeded, at the next Joan was wounded holding a scaling ladder and the attack faltered, but she returned to it and it succeeded. At the next she bore her banner again, and at the next most of the English defending the fortification died when the bridge they fled over broke under them.The English responded by giving up their siege and risking all on a pitched battle. The French could attack each fort in turn and so destroy them in detail, and seeing this, the remaining English soldiers burned their forts and withdrew all their companies together into a single formation, planted their stakes52 and offered battle on the open field.This time the opinion of the Armagnac captains was for war, but Joan said, no, it was Sunday, they should respect the Lord's day and not shed blood on it. The English withdrew, and Joan was a legend.She was a legend in France, where a leading poetess came out of retirement to pen a new poem in celebration of her great victory. She was a legend in England, where the regent, Bedford, wrote to the young king to update him about the new danger from that \"disciple and lyme of the Feende, called the Pucelle, that used fais enchauntements and sorcerie\".53 She was a legend in Venice, where the representatives of the Morosini bank sent back reports because they'd be useful in planning voyages.54 And her legendary nature had concrete consequences. After her arrival at Orleans a militia had risen to support the French army; volunteers flooded into camp every day, some of them writing gushing letters home recounting how they had seen her, talked to her. The Duke of Brittany, long a neutral in the conflict, sent his confessor over her to reassure her that the Duke would send his son with a mighty army to the King of France's support.55 People invented the most heated rumors about her origins, full of wild speculation as they try to come up with coherent theories to explain how she ended up with all the skills she possesses.This legendary status gave her a lot of influence with her fellow soldiers and officers and random commoners,56 but less with the Dauphin. The Dauphin Charles seems to have been the sort of person who agrees to anything the person who talked to him last wants,57 and he had a peace party as well as a war party contesting for influence at his court and they thought he should stop reraising on this one good hand and accept his gains and try to negotiate some kind of final end to the war. Joan was equal to the task, though, and interrupted the middle of a strategy meeting to fall upon her knees and beg for him to come to Rheims and there be crowned. Charles made plans for this before anyone managed to talk him out of it, placing the Duke d'Alencon in charge (who seems to have been an early convert to Joan's cause, eager to do whatever God wanted since apparently God wanted to do exactly what he wanted to do except with better tactics) and he and Joan rushed off to organize a campaign for Rheims.They did not do this without objections, and serious ones, from the peace party but also from military men not suddenly struck by Joan's charisma. And these men had good reasons to object. If you happen to be a cold-blooded bastard with a deep understanding of the nature of supply lines and logistical warfare who naturally thinks in terms of realpolitik, marching straight for Rheims is obviously a really stupid idea. It means taking an army through English- and Burgundian-held territory where their cavalry can harass your lines of communication, your back to the river, where one battle risks encirclement and destruction, overcoming or bypassing a tremendous number of strong English fortifications including Paris, all for a wholly intangible gain because Rheims isn't even a very large city. Instead they could try to seize key forts, attack Paris and take the capital, go to Normandy to harass the lines of communication of the English, move against the Burgundian capital to break the alliance - why are they going to Rheims?Because, according to ancient tradition, kings of France must be crowned in Rheims. This sacred ritual is what establishes that the King is the King, chosen by God. As the Dauphin, Charles is head of the Armagnac party; as King Charles VII, he would be King of France, especially since his rival Henry VI is a small child and furthermore a small child in England who therefore hasn't been properly crowned yet. Joan has faith they can overcome the material obstacles and that pulling this off will give them huge spiritual gains, and if you replace \"spiritual gains\" with \"gains in morale,\" she is clearly right. The French army marches off with the King, ready to gamble everything on this one stroke.They take an elaborate circuitous route to avoid the main English strongholds and attack minor English strongholds, each reduced one by one. In each fight the French engage the English garrison, attack it and drive it from its fortifications in the town; in each they are victorious and the English fall back. As they advance volunteers flood to them, providing them with supplies, and captains long absent - including the exiled Constable of France58 - join the campaign, spirits revitalized and ready to return to the fray. Meanwhile the main English field army gathered to attack them, coming up to meet the French at the woodlands near Patay. The day before both sides had camped a safe distance, well aware of their opposition, and then as the next day broke the French and English field armies mustered for the climactic battle of the campaign.Unfortunately for the English, the Battle of Patay is the single most one-sided climactic battle I have ever encountered in all my studies of history. I'm not sure exactly why; the accounts of the battle (in secondary or primary sources) disagree with each other even more than they normally do, but so far as I can tell from the accounts and histories I've read, it happened something like this.The English army had been divided into three forces when it camped, and as the English drew up in the morning to fight they gathered together. The French assembled faster, in defensive formation to take an attack from the English, and then the Duke d'Alencon asked Joan what to do.\"See that you all have good spurs!\"\"What? Are we to turn our backs on them?\"\"No,\" said Joan, \"for the pursuit.\"59And the French rushed on the English vanguard with incredible speed, which was not quite finished joining the rest of the English army. Shocked to see the French, who they though were waiting for them, already rushing out of the woods, the vanguard routed instantaneously. The French pursued them into the second force, which, seeing the first disintegrate, routed itself, and meanwhile the commander of the rearguard, Sir John Falstaff, implemented a tactical withdrawal in good order, thereby extricating his force and wrecking his military career, ending up as the scapegoat for the entire doomed campaign and a comic relief character for Shakespeare. The casualty figures are staggering; the English lost \"two to four thousand men\" killed or captured, the majority of their force, while the French army had three deaths. This, to be clear, is about the number of men you expect to accidentally trip over their own stirrups dismounting and break their necks. The French swept onwards to Rheims, every town they reached surrendering within the day, and the Dauphin Charles was crowned King Charles VII of France before crowds cheering or weeping at the extraordinary victory, with Joan having the place of honor beside him. Crowds flocked to the king and the mood in the country was ecstatic.What is that thing in her hair, seriously, what.2.4: 'By my martin, the place would have been taken.'At which point the French court agreed to a truce for two weeks and their armies stopped campaigning for a while while the English and Burgundians raised more armies.No, really. If at any point I have given you a positive impression of the competence of the French court, I do revoke it! King Charles rode around accepting the fealty of various towns while Joan constantly urged him to march swiftly on Paris and finish the war. Joan's councils failing, she begged him for the chance to retire; she had successfully accomplished all of her prophesied tasks, the Duke of Orleans had been ransomed, Orleans had been relieved, the King crowned. Could she go home now? Her voices didn't have any more tasks for her, \"take Paris instead of dithering\" was just common sense.Instantly vetoed. Of course she couldn't leave! She was his best general! Instead the King gave her brothers arms and lands and knighthood and made her follow the army around instead of going home. Occasionally during the long periods of truce she had a job to do like investigating a fake saint,60 and when the campaign eventually resumed she was with the army again, but he didn't listen to her and he didn't let her go.And then she reverted to the mean. Not all the way, of course. But Patay was a miracle, and the miracle didn't recur. Her voices would tell her if other saints were fakes or not, and occasionally they'd start warning her that she'd be taken prisoner eventually, but for military advice they gave her no help, and without them she was merely a very good general. When she finally got her chance to make her attack on Paris it looked like she'd win but the English negotiated another truce over her head and Joan was a loyal vassal of her king, so that was that. Her actual capture - in a minor skirmish with the Burgundians, with her leading the vanguard on the way to the attack and the rearguard on the way back - was an anticlimax, and while we have a witness he politely declined to comment on the scene.61That left the Duke of Burgundy with the question of what to do with her. The ethical thing to do by the laws of war would be to ransom her back, but that would also give the French back their best general, and so Duke Philip was somewhat reluctant to do that. That reluctance was aided by the fact that Charles was back to mostly having the peace camp in the room with him instead of the war camp,62 and they viewed Joan's existence as a provocation to war all by itself.63 Joan wasn't ransomed. Instead the Burgundians imprisoned her as a legitimate war captive for a while and then arranged for a prisoner transfer in exchange for moderate compensation, which is to say they sold her to the English.64The English and their French subordinates, who had been desperately writing letters begging the Burgundians to give them Joan so they could BURN THE WITCH were, as you would expect, absolutely overjoyed.65 No woman could possibly have won Joan's victories, so either she's a saint or a witch, but if Joan was a saint, clearly the English government was in the wrong and any Frenchman working with them is a traitor. Since the English government was clearly in the right and they were not traitors, therefore she was a witch and had to be burned. They got the local inquisition (which they controlled) to set up a trial immediately, known to history as the Trial of Condemnation after its inevitable result.2.5. 'I appeal before God, the Great Judge.\"It was going to be a kangaroo court, of course. Now, you might think that inquisitions are just naturally kangaroo courts, but by the standards of the Inquisition, this was a kangaroo court; there were rules in place, and the English intended to follow them only insofar as these rules would not interfere with the result they intended. She was supposed to be judged by the bishop of her diocese; since the bishop of her diocese was pro-Armagnac, that was out, so they had her tried by the bishop of the place where she was taken - only the bishop of the place she was taken wasn't on their side, either, so they misrecorded where she was taken so that she could be tried by the Burgundian bishop of the neighboring diocese, Pierre Cauchon. She was legally allowed a defense attorney,66 which she didn't get; she was spied on during the confessional, two of the judges vanish halfway through and at the Trial of Rehabilitation the witnesses report they were fired for being too sympathetic to the defendant, she was guarded in a military prison by English men-at-arms instead of by churchmen or respectable women, and the list just goes on and on and on. They were supposed to have her tried in her home territory so everyone who knew her could give testimony, but they couldn't do that because it was held by the other side, so they declared that the room she was being tried in was legally speaking part of the diocese in which she was captured and pretended that was good enough. They were supposed to interview everyone in her home province to see if she had a good reputation, but somehow they never recorded their results; twenty years later at the Trial of Rehabilitation a Lorraine merchant recounted that one of his countrymen in Rouen came to him full of bitterness that Cauchon hired him and then refused to pay him because \"in the course of his inquiries he had learned nothing about Joan that he would not have liked to hear about his own sister.\"This did not stop the trial from being a great show. It really is one of the great achievements of this or any age. I could say great artistic achievements, but that would suggest that anyone was aiming at art; it is beautiful not in that it was made to be beautiful, but in that watching someone - anyone - perform at the top of a game - any game - is beautiful. Of the 400-odd pages in my edition, about 130 or so are the introduction and the background (including biographies of everyone mentioned in the trial), then another hundred or so are the bureaucratic minutia of listing who is present at the start of every day of the trial, and then the remaining 170 pages is Joan of Arc being lobbed tricky questions by the best theologians the English government can hire and, without saying anything heretical,67 spending these 170 pages trolling them.Does this woman look like a troll to you?Asked if the people of Domrémy sided with the Burgundians or the other party, she answered that she only knew one Burgundian; and she would have been quite willing for him to have his head cut off, that is if it had pleased God.Asked if the voice told her in her youth to hate the Burgundians, she answered that since she had known that the voices were for the king of France, she did not like the Burgundians. She said the Burgundians will have war unless they do as they ought; she knows it from her voice.Asked whether in her youth she had any great intention of defeating the Burgundians, she answered that she had a great desire and will for her king to have his kingdom.Did she say that God (who is Love) told her to hate the party of the Burgundians? No. Did she intend to defeat them, prior to her revelation? No. Did she want them dead? Well, yes, but only if it pleases God.(Her judges are Burgundians.)Asked what blessing she said or asked over the sword, she answered that she neither blessed it herself, nor had it blessed; she would not have known how to do it.Asked if she ever put her sword on the altar, and if she did so to bring it better fortune, she answered no, as far as she knew.Asked if she ever prayed for her sword to have better fortune, she answered: \"It is well to know that I could have wished my armor (in French mon harnois) to have good fortune.\"(Blessing it is heretical because she's not a priest, going to effort to have it blessed might be idolatry if you really want to stretch it, and praying to be better at killing people is kinda sinful.)Asked whether, since her voices had told her that in the end she should go to Paradise, she has felt assured of her salvation, and of not being damned in hell, she answered that she firmly believed what the voices told her, namely that she will be saved, as firmly as if she were already there.Asked whether after this revelation she believed that she could not commit mortal sin, she answered: \"I do not know; but in everything I commit myself to God.\"And when she was told that this was an answer of great weight, she answered that she held it for a great treasure.(The belief that she's immune to sin is heresy. The belief that she can go to Heaven in a state of mortal sin is heresy. The belief that she'll eventually go to Heaven can't be heresy because Jesus told specific people they would go to Heaven.)Asked if God ordered her to wear a man's dress, she answered that the dress is a small, nay, the least thing. Nor did she put on man's dress by the advice of any man whatsoever; she did not put it on, nor did she do aught, but by the command of God and the angels.Asked whether it seemed to her that this command to assume male attire was lawful, she answered: \"Everything I have done is at God's command; and if He had ordered me to assume a different habit, I should have done it, because it would have been His command.\"Asked if she thought she had done well to take man's dress, she answered that everything she did at God's command she thought well done, and hoped for good warrant and succor in it.Asked if, in this particular case, by taking man's dress, she thought she had done well, she answered that she had done nothing in the world but by God's commands.She is simultaneously utterly direct, so exceedingly Christian that on no point of doctrine can they call her out, and qualified to perfectly sidestep every single question they ask her. It must have been infuriating.68She started everything off by quibbling about the oath they wanted her to swear (she'd previously sworn to keep King Charles's secrets, and so she needed to clarify that she would only swear limited oaths to tell the truth about things that touch on the trial and don't touch on the king) and then when the bishop judging her asked her to say the our father she said she would - if he'd hear her in confession.(He obviously couldn't prosecute her if he was her confessor! That would violate the seal of the confessional! Also, he can't really refuse because this is his job. He tries to offer her someone else hearing her confession and eventually drops the point.)Entertainingly, she does this without apparently knowing anything except war and, uh, now theology somehow? They ask her if she'd tell the Pope anything differently than she tells them and she immediately demands to be taken to the Pope.69 They ask her which Pope and she goes... the pope in Rome?(The Avignon schism was, metaphorically speaking, last week, and in a couple decades the people trying her are going to schism briefly and elect their own Pope because they dislike the Roman one.)The thing about all this is, though, that it's totally irrelevant to the actual situation. She can beat all the inquisitors in the room in debate, sure. That doesn't matter. The English bought her so they could kill her, ideally in a way that disgraces her king, and they aren't going to just let her go. She's the enemy's best general! When she answers all their absurd trick questions correctly, they respond by... writing down different answers than the one she gave and having her convicted based on them.70 They end up concluding that she must be a heretic because she (a) wears men's clothes and (b) refuses to submit to the Pope,71 72 then they convict her of heresy and witchcraft, tell her that if she doesn't repent they'll burn her and if they do they'll let her go, then when she \"repents,\"73 they throw her back in prison and only give her men's clothes to wear,74 and convict her of relapsing into heresy when she wears them instead of going naked. Then they burn her!The sense of atmosphere we get for the burning is that of a garrison in hostile territory who is pretty sure there's about to be a riot. She warned Cauchon that she had made her appeal for justice to God75 before taking a last communion, spending her last moments with a sympathetic priest confessing her sins before being hurried down to the fire by eight hundred armed men; none of the usual cries of eagerness at a burning are reported, only yelling at the English and crying for her.As she was hurried down she begged for a cross to hold; an English soldier gave her one, and as soon as Cauchon had declared her a relapsed heretic and handed her over to the secular power they hauled her down to the logs to be burned. For some reason in all the rush they let her make a final speech,76 which took half an hour and involved forgiving everyone involved and begging them to forgive her all evils she did them; it's a wonder the city didn't riot. Her last words were prayers to the saints and to God, ending with cries of \"Jesus!\" Once the flames had died down the English swept her ashes into the river, so there wouldn't be any relics.She was nineteen. In all the haste of the day, the English had never actually convicted her of any crime.77Shortly afterwards,78 the executioner79 rushed up to a monk, telling him \"God help us, we have burned a saint. God help us, we have burned a saint.\"History has tended to agree with him.2.6: \"Rejoice, free kingdom of France, for now God fights on your side.\"History has tended to agree with him - eventually.The English and their allies didn't publish the full trial transcripts. A copy was kept in Rouen, where the trial took place; another copy was sent to Rome, where I suspect the very busy Pope put it in a file drawer somewhere; and I would guess a third copy went somewhere. What they published was the concluding section: The twelve articles of heresy they accused her of, her responses to them, and the conclusion of the judges (\"burn her!\"). The consensus of Catholic Europe was to assume it was a perfectly normal inquisitorial trial that convicted a perfectly normal heretic of perfectly normal heresy, and an embarrassed silence descended upon the French court on the topic of Joan of Arc. She might have won their battles, but her death made them look bad, and so they were silent.A few decades passed. She was burned in 1431; in 1435,80 after French victories alternating with long truces, an attempted tripartite council between the French, Burgundians and English ended with the outcome least favorable to England - Bedford, the regent of England, dead of an illness and the Burgundian-Armagnac feud put on pause while they ganged up on England. 1436 saw the fall of Paris to the French and now the French armies were unstoppable, racking up victory over victory while the English collapsed into the internal feuds that would lead to the Wars of the Roses.Meanwhile, the records of the first trial remained in Rouen in their metaphorical file drawer. In 145081 the French took Rouen, and in their metaphorical file drawer the files rested.But there was a right for families of a condemned victim to request to reopen trials, and Joan of Arc still had friends. A few preliminary stabs had been taken to reopen the trial in 1450 and 1452, but in 1454 her mother and brothers82 petitioned the Papacy for the case to be reopened. An inquiry was slowly started, but it accelerated when they saw the Rouen files and realized what had actually happened in the first trial. 1455 saw the second trial unleashed in full, with 115 witnesses being interviewed, including everyone in Joan's village old enough to know her and all the people who had conducted the first trial and were willing to accept an offer of safe-conduct.This trial - the \"Trial of Rehabilitation,\" after its result, the overturning of the verdict of the first trial - is the source of the interviews that comprise most of our evidence. We have the records of the original trial, but the only reason we have the original handwritten notes is that the Trial of Rehabilitation found them.83 All the records of the Trial of Rehabilitation are still there and we've quoted them regularly in the essay.This means there's a giant vulnerability in our sources. What if the Trial of Rehabilitation was a show trial, but in the opposite direction? What if all that evidence was made up? In that case, most of what I've quoted would be unreliable. We'd be down to the Orleans burgher's journal and the Venetian letters and those other sources, most of which aren't eyewitnesses.All I can say is: I don't think so. I'm not a forensic linguist, but I've read a lot of it and it sounds like it's in different voices and I've read a lot of histories and they take it seriously as a source and I bet a forensic linguist could get a lot of citations publishing a paper saying \"Retrial of Joan of Arc Proved Fraudulent!\"But if we're going to take our sources seriously, that means we need to try to grapple with what our sources say, and our sources describe a lot of miracles..First, a warning: Remember when I said I was reviewing the evidence for Joan of Arc? I lied.84 I reviewed the evidence for Joan of Arc available in English. We've got two translations of the Trial of Condemnation (I read the free one) and then a couple of books pasted together from primary-source quotes, mostly from the Trial of Rehabilitation, and then we have like fifty different modern popular historians writing books about how cool Joan is that I read a bunch of. I didn't review all the evidence for Joan of Arc, and I invite someone else to, because the evidence was in a mixture of medieval French, modern French and Latin and in spite of all my efforts I am tragically monolingual.Still, with the evidence we've seen, let's try to come up with some solutions for this.Part Three: \"And we know that all she has said has always come to pass.\"First, though, there's one more thing I need to cover.One thing which kept coming up in earlier sections, and I kept cutting so it wouldn't interfere with the flow, is that Joan of Arc keeps making predictions about the future and they keep happening.85Most of them are pretty explicable. Quoth the Duke d'Alencon:[W]hen I left my wife to come to the army with Joan, my wife said to Joan that she was very much afraid for me, that I had been taken prisoner before, and that they had had to pay so much money for my ransom that she would have liked to beg me to stay. Then Joan answered her, \"Have no fear. I will return him to you safe and sound, and in the state he is in now or in a better one.\"\"During the attack on the town of Jargeau, Joan told me at one moment to retire from the place where I was standing, for if I did not \"that engine\"—and she pointed to a piece of artillery in the town—\"will kill you.\" I fell back, and a little later on that very spot where I had been standing someone by the name of my lord de Lude was killed. That made me very much afraid, and I wondered greatly at Joan's sayings after all these events.\"We can nearly explain that marvel with his memory being unreliable after twenty years, turning general good advice into confident predictions. Similarly, one of the bits of the Poitiers examination that I had to cut above is her most explicit summation of her goals, recounted by the elderly Dominican, Seguin Seguin:\"I told Joan that it was not God's will that she be believed if nothing appeared by which it should seem that she ought to be believed, and that the King could not be advised, on her mere assertion, to entrust her with soldiers that they be placed in peril, unless she had something else to say. She answered: 'In God's name, I am not come to Poitiers to make signs; but take me to Orleans, I will show you the signs for which I have been sent,' adding that men be given her in such number as should seem good to her and that she would go to Orleans. Then she told me, me and others present, four things which were then to come and which thereafter happened. First, she said that the English would be defeated and that the siege which was laid to the town of Orleans would be raised and that the town of Orleans would be liberated of the English... She said next that the King would be crowned at Rheims. Thirdly, that the town of Paris would return to its obedience to the King; and that the Duke of Orleans would return from England. All that I have seen accomplished.\"On the one hand, if this testimony is to be trusted Joan is behaving very well by rationalist standards! She's helpfully calling her shots in advance to avoid the sharpshooter effect, making many specific predictions of individual events. There's just two problems with this. First, all these predictions are correlated - the Duke of Orleans is more likely to be ransomed if they have lots of prisoners to trade for him, which is more likely if they're winning the war, they're not likely to win the war without raising the siege of Orleans, and any victory will inevitably involve the king being crowned and Paris returning to French control, so most86 of this reduces to \"I predict the war will go well because I'm going to win it for us,\" which is less of a prophecy than a promise.And, second, while we can't exactly expect medieval Frenchmen to carefully write down all their predictions as soon as they make them when our own government doesn't, we have the major problem that all these predictions are written down after they occurred, which means that the good brother's memory might not be reliable.Now, we do have other people quoting other, simpler versions of the same prophecies:Then we asked her why she had come, and she answered, \"I have come in the name of the King of Heaven to raise the siege of Orléans and to lead the King to Rheims for his coronation and his anointing.\"orShe said that she had two (reasons) for which she had a mandate from the King of Heaven; one, to raise the siege of Orleans, the other to lead the King to Rheims for his sacring.But, again, they're all recorded in the Trial of Rehabilitation, after that has happened. Wouldn't it be wonderful if Joan made some predictions in advance, recorded by her enemies, all carefully recorded in a file drawer in Rouen, so we could see how accurate she was?Yeah, she did.JOAN: Before seven years be passed, the English will lose a greater gage than they had at Orleans, and they will lose all in France. And the English will even suffer a greater loss than they ever had in France and this will be by87 a great victory which God will send to the French.Question: How do you know that?JOAN: I know it well by a revelation which has been made to me, and it will happen before seven years; and I should be very vexed should it be so long deferred. I know it as well as I know that you are there in front of me.Question: When will this happen?JOAN: I know not the day nor the hour.Question: In what year will it happen?JOAN: That too you shall not have, but I would that it might be before Saint John's Day.This is a pretty good prediction. But it's not perfect. It's written down in early 1431 and presumably made in early 1431, too, by the date of the trial. The relevant dates for her prediction: May 1435, French win a small-scale victory at Gerberoy, killing a leading English general; September 1435, Bedford dies of natural causes and the Burgundians switch sides again; April 1436, French take Paris with support from inside the city; 1441, the last English stronghold within the Ile de France falls; 1453, every English stronghold in France falls except the debatably French Calais; 1558, Calais falls.It's true that, \"before seven years be passed,\" the French would win a great victory; talking the Burgundians into switching sides and the fall of Paris both count. And it's arguable that the English would suffer a greater loss than they ever had in France, since when Henry V died his brother Bedford could replace him, while there was no qualified replacement for Bedford. On the other hand, he died during a truce in the war, and I doubt it was a result of \"a great victory.\" The English lost more men at Patay than Gerbois, so Joan certainly couldn't claim it was a greater loss than Patay, though see footnote 86. The fall of Paris can certainly count as \"a great victory\" and I wouldn't be surprised if in \"number of Frenchmen under their control\" it was the most important victory for the French, but not in losses among the English.But you'll note that they don't lose all in France - even in the Ile de France - \"before seven years be passed,\" unless Joan has a different definition of the Ile than Wikipedia does.It's not a perfect prediction. But it's pretty good.Asked what promises they made, she answered: \"That is not in your case at all.\" And amongst other things, they told how the king would be reëstablished in his kingdom, whether his enemies wished it or not. She said also that they promised the said Jeanne to bring her to Paradise, and she had asked it of them.The last section is uncheckable. The rest is a very simple prophecy that boils down to \"we'll win the war.\" To the extent it predicts anything more specific, it's \"we will win in this generation, before the throne passes to the king's heir.\"Asked if the voices had told her that within three months she would be delivered from prison, she answered: \"That is not in your case; however, I do not know when I shall be delivered.\"Asked if her counsel had not told her that she would be delivered out of the present prison, she answered: \"Ask me in three months' time; then I will tell you.\" She added: \"Ask the assessors, on their oath, if that concerns my trial.\"Asked afterwards, when the assessors had deliberated, and unanimously concurred that it did, she said: \"I have already told you that you cannot know all. One day I must be delivered.\"This sure looks like she's making an incorrect prediction: That she'll escape prison. If true, this would sink her case.The only problem is that the text goes on:And beyond this the voices told her she will be delivered by a great victory; and then they said: \"Take everything peacefully: have no care for thy martyrdom; in the end thou shalt come to the Kingdom of Paradise.\" And this her voices told her simply and absolutely, that is, without faltering. And her martyrdom she called the pain and adversity which she suffers in prison; and she knows not whether she shall yet suffer greater adversity, but therein she commits herself to God.Which sure sounds to me like \"they told her she would be martyred, in the sense in which we use the term today and not just in the older sense of suffering, and she completely misunderstood 'delivered from the pains of Hell' as 'delivered from the jail cell you are currently in.'\" The great victory spoken of can either be her victory in the debate or, frustratingly, the victory of Jesus over death. Stupid prophecies.So, are there any prophecies where she is just unambiguously wrong? I think I've managed to track one down:Question: What was the cause for which you leapt from the tower of Beaurevoir?88JOAN: I had heard say that all they of Compiègne down to the age of seven years were to be put to fire and to blood, and I preferred to die rather than live after such destruction of good people, and that was one of the causes of my leaping. And the other was that I knew that I was sold to the English and I would rather have died than to be in the hands of the English, my adversaries.Question: Did you make that leap on the advice of your voices?JOAN: Catherine told me almost every day that I must not leap and that God would help me and also them of Compiègne. And I said to Saint Catherine that since God would help them of Compiègne, I myself would (like to) be there. Then Saint Catherine said to me: \"Without fail, you must accept your lot (be resigned, take what is happening in good part), and you will not be delivered until you have seen the king of the English.\" And I answered her: \"Truly, I would rather not see him, and I would rather die than be put into the hands of the English.\"This is the prophecy that seems to me like the best evidence against Joan's divine inspiration. She says that her voices flatly tell her something that never happens. On the other hand, the context is that she needs to not try to escape and not confess; if we want to defend her we can either suggest memory error (she was told this just before jumping out of a tower window and badly injuring herself), translation error (she does see the leader of the English, Bedford, briefly, but he's regent for a king who's a small child89) or point out that this is a conditional, and she disobeyed the voices. But I take it as pretty good evidence against the divine theory, just - frustratingly - inconclusive.3.2: \"We wish to know the truth of this matter.\"What are we to make of this?I tend to have three models in my head when I review this. In deference to C.S. Lewis's famous trilemma, I have tended to call them Saint, Schemer and Schizophrenic.By the first model, she was both honest and correct when she described what was going on: Saints in heaven can and do petition God to produce miracles, and out of all the wars in history, God decided to put his hand down really, really hard on this one by handing a random holy peasant detailed instructions on how to win battles, unparalleled persuasiveness and the ability to go around asking saints questions and getting answers on semi-arbitrary topics.90 Once she'd done enough to win the war for her side He stopped giving her useful support, but did make sure that events helpfully provided an extremely complete and detailed record of her deeds to the future, just so future historians would not have the slightest excuse for not believing in miracles.In the second model, she was a military genius out of nowhere who decided to play saint because that was the way society would listen to her. She says - and I believe her - that there were already rumors going around that \"the kingdom that has been lost by a woman will be regained by a virgin from the Lorraine marches\", and there's people who will say \"then let that be me.\"But this doesn't actually explain half of what needs explaining about her! How did she learn military riding, how did she learn to wear armor and fight in armor, how did she learn the theology that lets her win debates with inquisitors? You need to put a conspiracy together, with elements of the Armagnac government deliberately prepping her in advance of her public appearance, but how did they know she was a military genius? Or, if actually the entire time that was Dunois or some other officer whispering in her ear, how did they know she was so charismatic? And how large is this conspiracy, anyway? If she didn't spend the first fifteen years of her life in a village, why do so many people testify she did in so many different words? Why couldn't the Burgundians find any evidence to the contrary? What about her mother and father and her brothers, were they all in on the conspiracy? Why didn't any of the people who rebelled against Charles VII later in life, like the Duke d'Alencon or Jean Dunois or as far as I can tell every other nobleman in France, ever spill the beans? And why is she so crazy about religion? She spends all her time praying and when she's on trial she spends, like, an hour a day haggling over the terms of her oath of honesty!In the third, she's mentally ill. We know that being slightly manic is a common trait of Very Successful People; the drive to push past all obstacles and do the impossible tends to correlate with lots of energy, absolute self-confidence and a sort of hypnotic charisma. By this theory, she's slightly more manic than that. Hallucinations are culturally mediated; she hallucinates saints telling her to Do Good at first and then, later, save the world. Of course, this doesn't explain her being a completely untaught military genius, or a completely untaught theology genius. Generously, it explains part of her charisma, and charisma is certainly useful for warfare - but she's clearly very intelligent, too, which this doesn't predict, and we also need to ignore all the testimony about prophecy and miracles or claim it was all coincidental. There's some pretty huge complexity penalties91 here.All these models involve her being very charismatic because she is very charismatic. It's very hard to read her and not fall under her sway. Mark Twain was a member of her fan club; so was George Bernard Shaw; so am I. Twain was an unconventional Christian at best and Shaw was a full-blown atheist, but her charisma is strong enough to reach across the gap of ages and ensnare us all. We know she was charismatic. The question is - given that, how can we explain everything else?Obviously, if you're a Catholic, you can be content with the first model, and indeed can be very smug that is exactly what your religion would predict. Non-Catholic Christians might want to consider switching sects, or just might want to say that Joan is before Protestantism and we don't know what she would have thought of it.92The rest of us have a harder problem. Neither of the other two theories make sense. Specific points that I debate back and forth with myself:3.3: \"Thus spake the people, but whether she had done well or ill, she was burned that day.\"(Enter ARUNDEL, who believes Joan is mad, and BASILICA, who believes she is a saint, halfway through a long argument.)Arundel: Why this war?Basilica: You mean, out of all the wars for God to put his finger on, why should He put it here?Arundel: Yes! The Armagnacs are crooks. Charles VII is a pretty terrible king. The knight who was her bodyguard was planning to rape her on the road! Sure, the English suck, but everyone in this entire story sucks. If you want to say that God cares more about religion than morality, that doesn't even help. Everyone here's a Catholic, they're just really bad at it. How can you possibly come up with a predictive model of God that predicts this?Basilica: You mean, instead of intervening here, God could intervene when the weak are oppressed by the strong - as in the Holocaust, or Tokugawa's persecutions of the Japanese martyrs, or if He is specifically trying to spread the Christian religion He could make the Crusades a success. If God doesn't discriminate by Christian sect, He could preserve the Byzantine empire, and if He's specifically Catholic, He could have the Thirty Years' War last just five years and end with a permanent Catholic Holy Roman Empire.Arundel: Exactly!Basilica: Well, first, you don't know that He didn't interfere at the Crusaders' Siege of Jerusalem -Arundel: If he did I'm blaming him for the massacre.Basilica: - or the first dozen times Constantinople held off attack, or in aid of the defense of Malta?Arundel: Sure, if you're religious maybe your model says he does that. But this still doesn't predict God the way that good guys/Christians winning every battle they ever fight against bad guys/pagans does, and they don't. But even if he is, why, in addition, do it here? To prove that miracles are real? God clearly doesn't want to do that, or He would just do miracles in some really obvious way today, and then we wouldn't need to trust the discrimination of 15th-century Frenchmen.Basilica: Look, leaving aside the age-old debate over free will and why God doesn't solve our problems for us - I realize \"mysterious ways\" is a cheap shot, but this is one of the hinge points of history. There's no reason to believe the English would stop rolling over France if they took Orleans, and no reason not to expect they'd hold on if they took it.93 If England rules France - or, more accurately, an Anglo-French King rules both - what does the Protestant Reformation look like? The colonization of the New World? The rise of democracy? If God wants to butterfly history into our path, there's a thousand different ways we could have missed the goal if the Hundred Years' War goes differently.Arundel: Joan of Arc is a lot more than a butterfly.Basilica: Ironically, this is where the corruption and ineptitude enter play on the other side. Maybe there wasn't a butterfly that would do it. Maybe the French screwed up every single chance they got to solve problems with only very subtle miracles, and so it took a blatant one to do it.Arundel: That is a hell of a complexity penalty.Basilica: On the other hand, so's any theory that denies her miracles.Arundel: Some of them have good explanations.Basilica: Such as the weather control? We've got eyewitness testimony.Arundel: Written down twenty years later.Basilica: Sure. But the fact that the wind changed direction had meaningful military consequences.Arundel: And yet most of the Popular Histories About How Cool Joan Is don't mention this miracle! They just say she got the convoy in.Basilica: They are atheist cowards and this is why you should always go back to the primary sources.Arundel: Or they read alternate testimony not included in Pernoud's collection that disagreed with Dunois'. Or maybe they think she just guessed the wind would change and got lucky when it did.Basilica: Complexity penalty!Arundel: Any theory that doesn't require a God who sees the fall of every sparrow will involve some coincidences somewhere.(They pass under an archway, and for a moment you can't hear them. As they leave, the conversation resumes -)Basilica: At her trial, she outargued a room full of theological experts with no formal training or defense counsel.Arundel: She came up with clever ways to avoid their questions. When you look at the ability of police today to convince people to confess to crimes they haven't committed, I agree this is extraordinary and suggests she was very smart and had great social skills, but if she was very smart and had great social skills, that means we need to explain fewer miracles, not more.Basilica: Did you ever read Montaillou: Cathars and Catholics in a French Village?Arundel: I did not.Basilica: As part of the Albigensian Crusade, the Inquisition interviewed every single person in an Occitan village about what they believed.Arundel: And they were heretics?Basilica: Yes, but the interesting thing is that they weren't mostly Albigensian heretics! They'd independently invented six different kinds of atheism or gnosticism or wilder beliefs (the four great evils are Satan, the Pope, the King of France and their bishop) and just went on thinking that until they were asked. Any one of those people - ordinary people in an ordinary village - would have been burned at Joan's trial in five minutes flat. Nobody without theological training would survive.Arundel: I have been regularly told by Christians that theology is basically just logic and deducible from the premises of the religion, and very smart people are good at logic.Basilica: I'm a Christian and I don't buy it. Brilliant people in the fourth century and in the sixteenth century and in the twentieth century study their Bibles, read theologians, and come up with heresies conclusively condemned by Athanasius. Indeed, we observe that all these brilliant people assembled in the fourth century produced dozens of close church councils which the Emperor tried to shape to whatever was most politically useful, and then later centuries saw hundreds of extremely corrupt papal elections between would-be Popes where the Cardinals were paid vast sums to vote for the candidate who paid most, some of which produced Popes who made historically-vital rulings for utterly cynical reasons. If God is real, maybe the Council of Nicaea was divinely inspired; but if God isn't real, theology is men looking at their reflection, quarreling about it, and then voting to decide who to kill for being in the minority. If everyone who doesn't study theology in the twelfth century is a heretic, and everyone who doesn't study theology in the twentieth century is a heretic, shouldn't Joan have just been a heretic?Arundel: I agree that this is adding a lot of complexity to the atheist theory! But Joan was very pious. All you need to argue is that her village priest wasn't a heretic - which if the Catholic Church is any good at its job, he shouldn't be - and that any other errors she made were corrected at Poitiers, and she pays attention and learns the right answer and then remembers it later.Basilica: I am touched by your faith in the simplicity and purity of the Christian doctrine and the ability and honesty of the Catholic church.(ARUNDEL laughs.)Basilica: And the artillery! Imagine, Arundel, that you hear that Google has just offered a $1 billion a year salary to a new employee, a young woman from a small tribe in Africa who was illiterate until the age of fifteen.Arundel: This seems unlikely.Basilica: Yup. Would you guess she was hired to be their new top programmer? The first ballistae were invented by a devoted R&D team around 400 BC,94 and ever since then the artillery has been one of the most technical fields of warfare. You give random noblemen commissions in the cavalry and trust to their ability to charge with fervor; the reason Napoleon was an artillerist was because the artillery was where you sent the people with a good mind for geometry and ballistics.Arundel: Today, I'd expect her not to be a computer programmer - just like in 1800, I wouldn't believe in an illiterate artillery savant being Napoleon. But she wasn't being Napoleon! When you say that they need to know ballistics, you imply that they knew what they were doing. If everyone is calculating by eye, the person with the best intuitive ability to calculate projectiles - which I'll bet you is IQ-correlated - is your best artillerist, and Joan was clearly brilliant.Basilica: I'm really not sure you're right. I'm no more of an expert on the development of artillery than you are, but this pattern-matches to a lot of \"dumb medievals\" stories, and this is the late middle ages, not the Dark Ages. They not only have geometry, they practically worship geometry. Why shouldn't they be able to solve this?What tools would God use to make the cosmos but a compass and straightedge?Arundel: They probably did. The very first siege where artillery is recorded as being used in western Europe is Orleans! By fifty years after that maybe they have an answer, but not within the year! I'm not saying they're dumb, but it does sometimes take more than a year to solve problems.Basilica: That's Fletcher Pratt who says it was the first siege and he is not a reliable source.(Enter CHAROLAIS, who suspects a conspiracy.)Charolais: Alternatively, she could just have gotten trained by an expert artillerist.(Two heads turn.)Charolais (unruffled): I heard you were talking about Joan of Arc. So, Arundel. I take it you support the theory that she was mentally ill?Arundel: Specifically manic, but yes.Charolais: Mania is not generally known to result in accurate predictions of the future or extraordinary horse-riding, lance-using skills.Arundel: You'd rather discard all the testimony of her village?Charolais: Yes, I think so. Neither you nor I have read the untranslated sections of the Trial of Rehabilitation, and we aren't trained in forensic linguistics. There are two points where if you're wrong your theory falls - your intuition that you can do a good enough job at amateur forensic linguistics to tell that the characters in the Trial of Rehabilitation have different voices, and your belief that Regine de Pernoud is a reliable source. If we discard one leading French historian of the period as reliable, we can conclude that, actually, Joan was recognized at an early age by someone in the Armagnac camp as super-capable, trained up for her job, and that the religion was a cover story.Arundel: I feel like there's dogs that ought to bark there that don't. There are quite a lot of other historians who would love to expose a leading rival as inept.Charolais: Yes, but were they translated into English?Arundel: They don't have to be. Pernoud was translated into English because she was a leading historian of Joan's age. She's writing against the trends by focusing so hard on the texts in an age of economic history and social history, so it would have been easy and profitable to shoot her down.Charolais: This is speculation and we both know it.Arundel: The fact that when Cauchon sent people to investigate Joan's reputation in her home province, they found nothing?Charolais: Travel was difficult and unsafe, and the Trial of Rehabilitation made up the testimony by the people who went and claimed to find a good reputation.Arundel: Epicycles.Charolais: Smaller ones than \"within a month she learned six skills to a professional level.\"Arundel: Actually, we don't know she was any good with a lance.Charolais: Three sources...Arundel: They testify twenty, thirty years after her death. If she was a faster learner than anyone they've ever met - which is still a complexity penalty but not much of one, we're both admitting she's brilliant - they might remember that as \"very good.\"Charolais: That gets you one. When she's good at every skill of war, why not admit that she probably had more than a month to learn them?Arundel: Because she's hardly the first shockingly brilliant teenage general! Sure, Alexander had Philip, but he died when Alexander was young and half of what Alexander did he had to invent for himself. The middle ages was an age of apprenticeships, and that means we don't have the formalized art of war that we will in another two centuries, only what fathers teach their sons. It's not that improbable she invents it herself.Charolais: It absolutely is!Basilica: Or you could admit it's a miracle.(Arundel laughs).Basilica: Since you've joined the conversation, Charolais! Let's talk about the death of Joan of Arc.Charolais: At her trial, she defended herself with the skill of a brilliant theologian. Therefore she was a brilliant theologian. Therefore she had training.Basilica: Not the trial, the death. The point where everything is lost and she goes to the flames and is burned alive. She could save herself by confessing!Charolais: She tried that.Basilica: No, she signed a document and the record was altered. We have six witnesses. If she'd confessed to the entire conspiracy - that she was trained up by their enemies, that she'd faked all her miracles, that she was lying from the start - she could have saved her life and probably gotten pretty heavily paid, as one of our sources testifies. It sure looks like Cauchon is stretching her death out so this very thing will happen, and it doesn't!Charolais: Martyrs do go gladly to their deaths, sometimes.Basilica: For something they believe in. In this period, that's the Catholic faith. Or the Muslim faith, or the Cathar faith, or the Hussite faith. They don't die for nothing.Charolais: Personally, as an atheist, I'm inclined to say that most martyrs die for \"it would be really embarrassing not to after I've gone this far,\" occasionally mixed with \"to hell with these people in particular.\"Basilica: Read the records of the day of her death! If she surrendered to Cauchon, she might have lived. If she'd tried to whip the mob into a frenzy, she might have lived. Instead she asked them to forgive her murderers. That is not the behavior of a fraud, but of a sincere believer.Charolais: Mmm...Arundel: I want to make another point. If it's a conspiracy, why didn't the Duke d'Alencon or Dunois spill? They rebelled against the King eventually, but never said a word about Joan being any sort of fraud.Charolais: Joan was their friend. They were neck and neck with her in it, and they didn't want to incriminate themselves or betray her.Arundel: Charolais, you've read about this court - its rapid changes of policy, its sudden and inexplicable shifts of method, Charles VII's inability to make any decision without second-guessing it, all shot through with Venetian spies. Can you actually believe anyone in it is qualified to run a conspiracy without it being exposed five minutes in?Charolais: Okay, I'll admit that part's tricky.-3.4: \"She is in truth come to accomplish magnificent things in this world.\"I think this is where I'm supposed to put what I learned from Joan of Arc.First, I learned that she's really, really cool. I talk about \"God stretching down His hand to alter history,\" and I'm really not sure I believe it happened, but Joan feels like a giant middle finger to all the people who talk about history being deterministic. Sometimes you get a Great Woman and then history does something really weird.I also kind of feel called out by God. \"So, you say you're a rationalist? You're dismissing all the historical evidence for miracles as insufficient? You won't consider the evidence for Jesus Christ persuasive due to a mere two eyewitness and five contemporary reports?95 You won't believe in anything without evidence more than sufficient to convince a court? Okay, have 115 witnesses to miracles that nobody could avoid recording because they altered the course of European history. Now, what were you saying about how you're not a Christian because you're a rationalist?\"On the other hand, I still do have my atheist model. Here, I suppose, is what it recounts:Imagine that you sort all the people in the world by how good evidence they are for God. If you restrict yourself to people alive today, you expect one in eight billion people is going to be so extraordinarily good evidence you would only expect one in eight billion people to be that impressive by chance.Now sort everyone who has ever lived by how good evidence they are for God.It isn't quite as impressive as it looks. Most people lived before recorded history; we can only expect the level of evidence we have for Joan in areas after the invention of the printing press and with people of historical importance, and the further you get from the English-speaking world the less likely I am to have access to sources on them. But that's still a lot of people, and Joan's at the head of the list. You aren't reading about Joan because she's a random person, you're reading about her because she's fascinating precisely because she's such unusually good evidence for miracles - she's not the product of random chance,96 she's the product of a \"sort the entire planet by how miraculous they seem\"97 function.I am genuinely conflicted. This seems to me to be sufficient evidence that I can't just handwave it as \"well, sometimes people will make shit up.\" No! Making shit up doesn't do this! Is this really just coincidence? Is this really just mania? Did God exist, and stretch out his hand for this war in particular? Why? I genuinely can't say.But, since I can't say, let's move on from the question of my spiritual agonies to useful lessons we can learn from this historical incident.First, Pierre Cauchon doesn't seem to have been a very wicked man. Wikipedia warns against rounding him off to a cartoon villain, and I'm inclined to agree. He seems to have been a perfectly ordinary politician in bishop's clothes, loyal to a great Renaissance prince and patron of the arts who in many ways deserved men's loyalty, interested in preserving the authority of Church councils against the unchecked authority of the Pope.Therefore he murdered a saint because she was politically inconvenient for his goals, and was furious with her when she wouldn't go along with it and just die, and celebrated when he finally managed to find a way to kill her off. Great evils aren't done by extremely wicked men. Bedford was a competent statesman trying to protect his family, Philip the Good was one of the finest princes of the Renaissance, and with Cauchon they all carried out Joan's destruction. You can be an ordinary good person and suddenly find yourself face-to-face with a hero you never believed you'd ever see, and murder her because she's politically inconvenient, and, having done so, not even get the benefits you sold your soul for. And that's a lesson that no men, at any time, can ever hear too much.Second, that in a maze of backstabbing politics, ineptitude, brutal criminality and betrayal within and without the government, of authorities who act like bandits and bandits who act like Huns, a saint can suddenly appear with the strength to rewrite history. When everything looks hopeless... you're probably screwed! But you might not be. A saint might appear. It's happened before. It can happen again.And, third and finally? If you're looking at these sources and seeing stories grow and change, seeing how the sources twenty years later are just slightly more polished than the contemporary sources, seeing how secondhand accounts distort the story and contemporary chroniclers include exciting incidents that never actually occurred, and you're panicking?Then I have a dreadful, doleful warning for you: This is just about as good as it gets. There are a few modern cases - the World Wars, say - where we have better information, where the participants published newspapers and kept diaries and sent each other letters and even didn't burn most of the letters, but if you go back very far, or pass into a country without cheap paper and the printing press and an extremely literate population, you will quickly discover that the evidence for Joan of Arc is stronger than the evidence for everything else. All of our historical sources before the printing press and most afterwards have gone through the same evolution as the evidence for Joan of Arc, and the difference between the life of Augustus and the life of Joan is that with Joan we can see the evolution, captured in amber. The life of Alexander the Great that we have now shouldn't be compared to Jean Chartier's narrative; chronologically, it's closer to the fix-fic written seventy years later in which after the coronation at Rheims, Paris surrenders without a fight and they march into Normandy and Charles VII promises to listen to Joan forever and orders the army to always do what she says.98 If you want to know the truth about Joan of Arc, you can read the chronicles of the time, or the modern histories that laboriously try to disentangle the evidence from the invention and the reality from the superstition, and you can hope they got the right answer.Or you can look at the book where the French clerks interviewed a hundred and fifteen witnesses and wrote down the results. Who knows? Maybe one of them got it right.1Very, very redacted.2This is hyperbole, they only got 115 people.3The evidence that's available in English. I don't speak Latin, medieval French or modern French, and should.4We have no histories from contemporaries of Alexander the Great, just inscriptions, fragments quoted in later histories, et cetera. There were histories written, to be clear! We know they were written! We even know his general Ptolemy wrote one claiming to be his half-brother! We just don't have them any more because all existing copies have been lost or destroyed. Blame the Huns and the Goths, I suppose.5Respectable history says this is just a bunch of coincidences, but Maurice Druon got some pretty good novels out of it.6The good-looking. Not the just. \"The Iron King\" is his other nickname, which fit much better.7Thereby explaining why the average rate of interest to monarchs throughout history was something around ten percent.8Scurrilous chroniclers report lots of exciting scheming around this time. Probably most of it didn't happen, but some of it might have.9\"The She-Wolf of France.\" Man, these people have great nicknames.10The two of them had arranged the overthrow and murder of his father.11Which built much of its powers in the reign of his great-grandfather, Henry III, who wasn't the first weak king to accidentally build strong institutions and won't be the last.12When it comes to army sizes, we're lucky when our sources only disagree by a factor of two.13This is the best name for shooting arrows at plate armor and watching them explode. See Skallagrim and Tod's Workshop on YouTube for more details.14... In Europe. The Mongols and their fellow steppe nomads were quite as good archers as the English and had even better bows, and I have never seen a head-to-head comparison of who could shoot faster.1515: Interestingly, one author of the French Revolutionary Wars - some four hundred years after our story - recommended the British ditch the single-shot musket for the longbow on these grounds. This probably would have been a mistake, since longbows didn't come with bayonets, but given that nobody but a few cuirassiers was wearing armor by that point I suspect Pitt's government would have gotten a good deal by recruiting any hobbyists still practicing with the weapon and having them fire on enemy infantry and cower inside a bayonet square whenever cavalry threatened.16Do you ever wonder if the French had it coming?17The ones who took major wounds didn't reach the English lines.18This is an interesting one which I included chiefly because no American has ever heard of it. The English and the French were allied with the main contenders, the Portuguese and Castillians, but in spite of this it looked remarkably similar to any of the battles of the Hundred Years' War, complete with the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance routing enemies that outnumbered them six to one using archers, defensive terrain and their enemies' rashness.19I'm mostly not crediting my sources because there's too many of them but I stole this line unusually blatantly. It's from Wikipedia.20To pick an element purely because I happen to know something about it: We have dance manuals in the fifteenth century from two places: Italy and Burgundy. They don't show up elsewhere in Europe until the sixteenth century, or for laggardly places like England, the seventeenth.21Wikipedia helpfully tells us that it may have been any or all of \"familial schizophrenia syndrome, typhus, bipolar disorder, [or] arsenic poisoning.\"22The name came from the title of Louis of Orleans's son's wife's father Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac, who lead the faction for a time. You do not need to remember his name.23Corruption by the standards of the period, yes. It was also suspected he was sleeping with his brother's wife on the side, but that was probably just hostile slander, especially if you're Catholic. (We'll get to that.)24The title of Dauphin is that of the heir to the French throne, like \"Prince of Wales\" in England.25Legally your brother's wife is your sister.26That they appealed and were de facto ignored is my supposition; there are people mentioning that they hold out hope Castile will help them, and they were allied with the Castilians in the last bout of the war, but I have failed to track down any evidence of any help Castile actually gave them.27They died in 1422 and Verneuil was in 1424.28It's not that the English weren't theoretically Catholic, too, they were just bad at it.29Our source for this is her own testimony - up until her journey to Vaucouleurs, she didn't tell anyone angels spoke to her. The most she managed was the crypting hinting to a friend of hers that we get the section title from.30One of the persistent problems with the language of every figure in this period, Joan included, is that France wasn't very well defined, in rather the same way an American could say \"New York\" to mean New York State or New York City, except worse. So \"France\" could mean either all of the territory held by the King of France and his vassals, all the territory rightfully held by the King of France and his vassals, all the territory in the ancient Kingdom of France, which had more different borders than I could shake a stick at, or just the Ile de France, the region surrounding Paris that was the heart of the domain of the French kings. Joan talks about herself as French and also talks about going into France from Lorraine, and plenty of others from this period talk about going from Normandy into France or France into Flanders. I can't ask them to talk more precisely than I speak myself, but it's still really annoying.31Most first-person quotes are from the two books Regine Pernoud wrote on this topic, Joan of Arc: By Herself and Her Witnesses - my favorite Joan of Arc book because it's mostly a primary source compilation - and The Retrial of Joan of Arc, also a primary source compilation but more focused. This one is from By Herself And Her Witnesses, but a bunch of others will be from The Retrial. The third-person quotes are mostly from the W.P. Barrett translation of her trial.)32At this point, Joan of Arc got dragged into a sidequest when the Duke of Lorraine (her theoretical liege-lord) heard rumors there was a miracle-worker around and decided to ask her to come visit him to heal his poor health. She went to him and told him he should stop sinning with his mistress and take back his wife, but that if he gave her an armed escort to Bourges she'd pray for him. He, having lived with his mistress for what I would guess was more than a decade at this point and having had five children with her, gave her four francs and sent her back to Vaucoleurs.33There's discussions of a royal marriage at this time to strengthen the alliance.34Catherine Le Royer: \"I saw Robert de Baudricourt, then captain of the town of Vaucouleurs, and Messire Jean Fournier, come into my house. I heard it from Joan that the latter, a priest, had brought a stole and that he had conjured her before the captain, saying that if there was any bad thing in her that she go hence from them, and that if there was a good thing then let her approach them. And Joan approached this priest and went down on her knees; and she said that this priest had not done well, since he had heard her confession.\" Joan of Arc by herself and her Witnesses, page 44.35Joan of Arc, By Herself and her Witnesses, page 46.36\"They said that in the beginning they wanted to require her to lie with them carnally. But when the moment came to speak to her of this they were so much ashamed that they dared not speak of it to her nor say a word of it.\"37Warning, this footnote is kind of boring - not every writer is Joan. But if you want our best guess to what the sign was, the chronicler Pierre Sala, writing a couple generations later, writes that a man who had served Charles in his youth told him that:\"In the time of the great adversity of this King Charles VII, he found himself (brought) so low that he no longer knew what to do. . . . The King, being in this extremity, entered one morning alone into his oratory and there he made a humble petition and prayer to Our Lord in his heart, without utterance of words, in which he petitioned devoutly that if so it was that he was true heir descended from the noble House of France and that the kingdom should rightly belong to him, that it please Him to keep and defend him, or, at worst, to grant him the mercy of escaping death or prison, and that he might fly to Spain or to Scotland which were from time immemorial brothers in arms and allies of the Kings of France, wherefore had he there chosen his last refuge. A little time afterwards, it came about that the Maid was brought to him, who, while watching her ewes in the fields, had received divine inspiration to go and comfort the good King. She did not fail, for she had herself taken and conducted by her own parents even before the King and there she gave her message at the sign aforesaid (dessusdit) which the King knew to be true. And thenceforth he took counsel of her and great good it did him.\"Which gets some notable parts of the story wrong, but if the heart of it is accurate it would be a sign that - consciously or unconsciously - could be delivered through the wholly non-miraculous skill of cold reading.38One of the recurring elements I find in the biographies of great generals is how insanely pissed off they are whenever politics deprives them of an opportunity to exploit military opportunities.39It's plausible she learned to ride a plowhorse as a child since Lorraine is horse country, but riding a warhorse is a specialized skill, and it's plausible she had a month or two at Vaucouleurs to practice swordsmanship, but I don't think there was anyone at Vaucouleurs to teach her command.40\"Wait, artillery? Aren't these people medieval knights with swords and lances and full plate?\" Yes. Gunpowder is older than plate armor(*). Our oldest recipe for gunpowder is 11th-century Chinese but it's writing down something that already existed, probably since the ninth century. In the thirteenth century it spreads to Europe and the Middle East, probably via the Mongols, but gunpowder weapons take a long time to get good, only exploding in popularity in Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, siege artillery first, field artillery second, handguns third. Joan of Arc is right at the point where artillery is starting to be important, with the Siege of Orleans being the earliest siege I know of where artillery played a major role.* Sub-footnote: Older than medieval plate armor, technically. Bronze plate armor dates back to Agamemnon, it just kind of sucked compared to iron chain or lamellar. The high and late Middle Ages saw an improving economy giving knights the ability to spend more and more on heavy armor to keep enemy spears and arrows and bullets and crossbow bolts out, and this demand was served by the arms and armor manufacturers of Milan and the Rhine competing in an arms race to develop better armor, with the first ambiguous plate appearing in the 12th or 13th century. The peak of personal protection is probably the beautiful suits of Gothic plate from around 1525, worn by the French cavalry at the Battle of Pavia, who in spite of the toughest armor in the world still can't ride their horses over Spanish pikemen or deflect bullets from German handguns, and from this point on the level of armor used by soldiers steadily decreases right up until steel helmets to deflect shrapnel return in the first World War and the pendulum's arc reverses again.41The details of the Battle of the Herrings are plot-irrelevant but hilarious. The troops besieging Orleans needed regular resupply; since Lent was approaching, they'd want preserved fish to eat on all those long meatless days, so the wagons were loaded up with pickled herring and sent with sixteen hundred troops or so as escort and reinforcement. The French under the Count of Claremont tried to hit the supply lines with four thousand of their own complete with heavy cavalry and artillery and Scotsmen, but the English commander, the oft-maligned Sir John Falstaff, drew up his wagons in a ring and had all his troops fight from the shelter of the wagons, and that threw the French into confusion. You can't lance a wagon. They tried an artillery bombardment, which was basically sensible, but their troops got bored partway through, charged and were decisively defeated, to the ruin of the French interception, the morale of the Armagnacs, and, of course, the career of the Count of Claremont.42He's still around at the start of Europa Universalis IV and has great stats.43\"Once, near to the town of Château-Thierry, having seen the mistress of one of the soldiers, a Knight, she pursued her with drawn sword. She did not, however, strike the woman, but warned her gently and charitably that she be no longer found in the company of the soldiers, otherwise she would do something to her which would not please her.\" We have another eyewitness to another event but I'm not going to quote him here because this essay is much too long.44This is not an example chosen at random.45One might call this person \"captain-general,\" and indeed I believe this is the etymology of the word \"general.\"46He is.47If that was a specific prediction and not just general good advice, I want to note that the cannoneer couldn't do that. Fifteenth century artillery is only a precision weapon insofar as the ball will probably not land behind the gun.48She continues: \"You thought to deceive me and it is yourself above all whom you deceive, for I bring you better succour than has reached you from any soldier or any city: it is succour from the King of Heaven. It comes not from love of me but from God himself who, at the request of Saint Louis and Saint Charlemagne*, has taken pity on the town of Orleans, and will not suffer that the enemies have the bodies of the lord of Orleans and his town.'\" Which is when the wind changes direction.*: Score: First-principles theories of how a rational religion ought to work, 0; the intercession of the saints, 1.49And called an \"Armagnac whore.\"50To which she responded with:\"'Bastard, Bastard, in God's name I command thee that, as soon as thou knowest that Falstaff [commander of the relief force] is come, thou shalt make it known to me, for if he pass without my knowing of it, I promise thee I will have thy head taken off!' To which answered the lord of Dunois that she doubt not, for he would indeed make it known to her.\"I find it really really easy to imagine this exchange, between an energetic teenager and the veteran officer of noble birth with ten years on her* and without god whispering in his ear.)*: Wow, these people are young.51\"After these exchanges, I who was weary and fatigued cast myself down on a mattress in the Maid's chamber, to rest a little. And likewise did she, with her hostess, on another bed, to sleep and rest. But while I was beginning to take my rest, suddenly the Maid rose from the bed, and making a great noise, roused me. At that I asked her what she wanted. She answered me: 'In God's name my counsel has told me to go out against the English and I know not whether I must go against their fortification (bastide) or against Falstaff who is to revictual them.' Upon which I arose at once and, as swiftly as I could, put the Maid into her armour.\"52The English longbowmen carried long wooden stakes with them that they'd plant into the earth before a battle to defend them from charging cavalry.53\"Disciple and limb of the Fiend, called the Pucelle [Maid or Virgin], that used false enchantments and sorceries.\" Consistent spelling is an anachronism.54I love the Venetians. They've got some of the best spy networks in Europe by this point and they use them to deliver cargo safely and price loans accurately.55Joan, naturally enough, told the Bretons that \"the duke should not reasonably have waited so long to send his men to help the King with their services.\"56Well, people who had been her fellow random commoners two years ago, anyway.57He ends up called \"Charles the Well-Advised,\" because \"Charles The Guy Where God Wanted Really Wanted Him To Have His Father's Throne In Spite Of His Many, Many, Many Personal Failings\" doesn't really roll off the tongue. Yes, spoiler, this guy wins.58Entertainingly, everyone still had orders never to work with him, ever, so the Duke d'Alencon said they'd have to withdraw if his reinforcements were coming to join them. Joan vetoed this because it was incredibly stupid and they negotiated something better. My favorite bit is where the two meet: the Constable's chronicler says that when they saw each other,\"He [the Constable] spoke to her and said: Joan, I have been told that you want to fight me. I do not know if you are from God or not. If you are from God I fear nothing from you, for God knows my good-will. If you are from the Devil, I fear you even less.\"At which point (the Duke d'Alencon says)\"Joan said to the lord constable: 'Ah! Good constable, you are not come for my sake, but because you are come you will be welcome.' \"I like these people.59This is a rephrasing. The exact words, from The Retrial of Joan of Arc:\"Then my lord the Duke of Alençon, in the presence of the lord constable, of myself, and of several others, asked Joan what should be done. She answered him loudly with the words, \"See that you all have good spurs!\" When those present heard this they asked her, \"What did you say? Are we to turn our backs on them then?\" \"No,\" answered Joan, \"it will be the English who will put up no defense. They will be beaten, and you will have to have good spurs to pursue them.\" And it was as she said. For they took to their heels, and they lost more than four thousand men in dead and prisoners.\"60There was a woman named Catherine de Rochelle going around fundraising \"for the war\"; she claimed she had a God-given power to find hidden treasure and she'd use it on anyone who didn't contribute to the war effort (via her) enough, and then she'd publicly reveal all their hidden wealth (and they, implicitly, would be under enough pressure from their neighbors to donate it). This worked to get donations and give her a comfortable living, but the King of France heard of her and, already having been bailed out of a crisis by one miraculous Maid, asked Joan to check if she was real. Joan's voices said no, but she went and talked to her and spent two nights watching her every moment and saw no angels, and reported back \"I have no evidence she is.\"61The Burgundians were paying his bills. Conclude what you wish from this.62This situation would eventually be resolved years after Joan's death when the Constable of France, one of the leaders of the war party, just flat-out illegally arrested his archnemesis de la Tremoille, head of the peace camp, and seized the status of the king's chief advisor for himself. He got away with this with no consequences whatsoever.63They were, of course, quite right, given how she would not shut up about how all of France should return to allegiance to its king and God would see him victorious; they were also quite wrong if they thought the English intended to stop fighting themselves.64For the conditions of her captivity, we have the report of a Burgundian knight:\"I saw Joan for the first time when she was shut up in the castle of Beaurevoir for the lord count of Ligny. I saw her several (many) times in prison and on several occasions conversed with her. I tried several times, playfully, to touch her breasts, trying to put my hand on her chest, the which Joan would not suffer but repulsed me with all her strength. Joan was, indeed, of decent conduct (honnête tenue) both in speech and act.By herself and her witnesses, page 227.65While the transfer was arranged, Joan attempted to escape twice, both times unsuccessfully.66The technical term is \"Advocate\".67As opposed to Discord conversationalists, who say things that I as an agnostic can be pretty sure are heretical, like, every six seconds. I bet a Catholic could get it down to two or three.68\"She seemed to me to be subtle with an altogether feminine subtlety,\" said the judge Jean Beaupere. Source: page 263 of Regine Pernoud's The Retrial of Joan of Arc.69It is customary to grant this request for an appeal, so this is another violation of trial procedures.70How do we know this? Why, because the Rouen archives weren't destroyed, and that means the French-language handwritten notes of the scribe who recorded her testimony (\"the French Minute\") were still in the archives, and we can compare that - and, as importantly, the French at the Trial of Rehabilitation could compare that - with the official Latin version broadcast for publication. The physical notes didn't survive the centuries, alas - if my memory is right the original Minute was lost in a WW2 bombing - but copies of it did. Basically, every time she demands her legal rights that she has no plausible way of knowing about but they're honor-bound to grant her, they leave it out of the official transcript.71This is the bit they changed. She in fact said she would submit to no authority's judgement as to the authenticity of her visions other than the Pope, which is barely not heretical.72There were a few more things on their list of accusations, but the men's clothes were clear proof of defiance of the court and the refusal to accept the judgement of the Pope was clear proof of heresy, and the rest they couldn't really make stick.73By signing a small note when all the bishops present tell her to. With an X, which was her symbol for \"disregard this, the letter is a lie.\" While laughing at them.74This is actually the less nasty of the two narratives about why she went back to wearing men's clothing. The nastier is that she was assaulted by her jailers while she was in womens' clothing and wore men's clothes because she could defend herself better this way. She blamed the bishop for not keeping her in a civilized ecclesiastical prison instead of guarded by English soldiers, which one witness of the trial said Cauchon hadn't done because it would offend the English.75You may have heard that God took vengeance on him, but in fact he died of a heart attack at the age of 71. It was a different one of her accusers who mysteriously turned up dead in a sewer.76Pernoud theorizes Bishop Cauchon was hoping she'd break at the last minute and disclaim all of her visions as fraud, which would have strengthened his hand. The notary testifies that he attempted to edit the record after the trial to claim she did, but he was unwilling to notarize that since it didn't happen.77In the middle ages, the Church lacked the legal power to execute people. All it could do was hand them over to the secular authorities - pronounced \"cops\" - with a warning that they were unrepentant heretics, and the judge was then supposed to pronounce them guilty of the crime of heresy on that evidence and sentence them to be executed, and only then was the executioner to get to work.78The source tells the story twice; in one telling it occurs after a midday dinner, in the other before it.79According to the monk involved. According to someone who heard the story secondhand, it was the King of England's secretary, a much more important person.80Or, as she put it, \"within seven years... and I should be very vexed should it be so long deferred.\"81I think. If my sources give an exact date I missed it, but the Normandy campaign that secured all of the duchy for the French was '49-50 and most of the action was in 1450.82With the support of at least some members of the French government, which is probably why this petition didn't end up in a file drawer.83The scribe who wrote them down at the first trial offered them up to the court at the second. I can't tell if it was genuine patriotism, desire to avenge an injustice, desire to have the authorities owe him a favor, or if he was worried he'd be in a court case ten years later and someone would ask him \"did you collaborate with the English occupation?\" and he wanted to be able to defend himself.84Except to those of you who read the footnotes!85I also want to cover one non-prophetic miracle she testified about, which is that she prayed a stillborn child would live and it woke up and breathed for exactly long enough to be baptized, which is one of these miracles that says frankly appalling things about the state of the world.86The ransom of the Duke of Orleans is an extra improbability, though. He'd been in captivity for a long time and prisoners often die.87The specific word \"by\" is found in Joan of Arc: By Herself And Her Witnesses, but absent in my complete translation of The Trial of Joan of Arc. It changes the meaning significantly and I am guessing the more recent translation is better but I don't actually know.88Where she was imprisoned by the Burgundians.89I have heard the rumor Henry VI briefly saw her trial but have no source for it at all. Since he's in Paris for his coronation in December of 1431 and Joan is burned in May of 1431, it's certainly not impossible, but I have seen no evidence it's true.90\"Asked if she calls them or if they come without being called, she answered that they often come without being called, and sometimes, if they did not come, she would pray to God to send them. Asked if she sometimes had called them without them coming, she answered that she never needed them, however little, but they came to her.\"91That is to say that:(a) the more complex an explanation has to be to explain Joan's marvels, the less good it is, and (b) a simple explanation that relies heavily on coincidence is actually a complex explanation in disguise.92Actually, she wrote the Hussites a very angry letter telling them she'd campaign against them when she had free time, and at one point - I think it was in the Trial of Condemnation but it might have been while she was very frustrated with the French peace party and its truces - she offered to go into exile and actually do it. So this suggests she's pro-Catholic, anti-Protestant, though of course we don't know what would have happened if she'd had the chance.93Arundel: Actually, what about the Wars of the Roses? Wouldn't France get free while the red and white roses fought?Basilica: Countries that lose wars and thereby lose territory have revolutions, as the populace looks for scapegoats for the disaster and the dispossessed elites managing the occupation flee to what remains of their country to compete for status with their already-established rivals. Countries that win wars do so much less regularly, and so an English victory here would probably prevent them.Arundel: I agree, I think.94The story is that it was invented for Dionysius I, Tyrant of Syracuse, a patron of the arts and sciences, who hired engineers to devise him clever weapons for his wars with Carthage.95I'm presently inclined to believe Mark and John are eyewitnesses, but that we also have the Synoptics as a unit drawing on the plausibly-eyewitness author of Q, as well as Josephus and Paul's letters.96To you! I, on the other hand, encountered her in a perfectly ordinary history book talking about perfectly ordinary history, so the evidence is somewhat stronger for me than for you.97To a monolingual English speaker.98This exists.",

They make the economy less efficient and poorer, but don't necessarily reduce the total number of jobs. For example, Britain in the 1950s had high tariffs and import controls, but also full employment. The claim that Smoot-Hawley caused the Great Depression is a myth, one fostered in part by anti-Keynesians who didn't want to admit that the problem was inadequate demand and the answer fiscal stimulus.But Trump has brought something special to the mix: Not just high tariffs, but unpredictable tariffs. Since April 2 nobody (probably Trump included) has had no idea what tariff rates will be for the next few months, let alone for the long term.As many of us pointed out, this uncertainty was a huge deterrent to business investment. Build a factory based on the assumption that tariffs will go back down to more normal levels, and you risk having a stranded investment if 20-25 percent tariffs are here to stay. Build a factory based on the assumption that high tariffs are the new normal, and you'll have a stranded investment if Trump chickens out.So many of us predicted an economic slowdown caused not by the level of tariffs but by uncertainty. Yet the predicted slowdown, while visible in \"soft\" data like surveys, kept not showing up in the hard data, making these predictions look all wrong.Hard data, however, aren't as hard as we'd like. Payroll numbers, in particular, rely a lot on assumptions and interpolations, and are often revised.And the revised numbers now show exactly the kind of uncertainty-induced slowdown I and many others predicted.These numbers don't show the long-run damage from Trump's tariffs, which are really a completely different story. In fact, the short-run jobs picture may improve now that it's clear that there won't be any real trade deals, just Smoot-Hawley redux as far as the eye can see.One thing is clear: The previously reported good numbers were proof of Trump's brilliance. Now that they've been revised away, the bad numbers are clearly Biden's fault, or maybe Jerome Powell's, or Barack Obama's.",

      "link": "https://philosophersbeard.substack.com/p/inheritance-tax-is-largely-irrelevant",
      "author": "Thomas Wells",
      "publishedAt": "2025-08-01T14:03:41.000Z",
      "content": "Lots of people think that a few people controlling a very large share of a society's economic power is a bad thing. It is unfair that some should have so much while so many have so much less. It is inefficient that so much wealth lies in the hands of people who already have everything they could reasonably desire. It gives some people an outsized influence on decisions that affect the whole society, and on democratic politics itself (previously). And so on.These people often also worry that economic inequality is increasing and becoming entrenched as the rich pass their excessive wealth on to their children and more and more wealth ends up concentrated in ever fewer hands. Many of them think increasing inheritance tax is necessary to stop this. But this solution relies on a mistaken understanding of how wealth is actually transmitted between generations.Many leftist commentators seem to believe something like the following argument:Premise 1: Rich people passing on their wealth to their children after they die is an important cause of rising economic inequalityPremise 2: Rising economic inequality is badPremise 3: Without higher inheritance taxes economic inequality will continue to riseConclusion: Therefore, inheritance taxes should be raisedI accept premise 2, but reject premises 1 and 3 because they are based on significant misunderstandings of how the world actually works.I. Rich Parents Don't Make Their Children Rich By DyingWhen we talk about the rich we should not limit ourselves to the very rich 1% or super-rich 0.1%. As Richard Reeves argues very convincingly, this too easily lets the larger upper middle class off the hook: the top 20% or so of the population who run our key institutions (universities, newspapers, philanthropic trusts, politics, government agencies, corporations, and so on), and use their influence to stack the odds in favour of themselves, their friends and their children, while blocking routes to social mobility by those beneath them.The rich do pass on enormous economic advantages to their children, but they do not wait until their death to do so. They acquire houses in the best school districts (while blocking rezoning efforts that would allow poorer people to afford to live there); pay for high quality extra-curriculars and child care; use their networks to access elite university and job opportunities; fund unpaid internships and post-grad vocational education (med/law school); subsidise the first step on the housing ladder; bail their children out when they make terrible mistakes; and so on. Thanks to all this parental help - which is made possible only by their special wealth - these children enjoy outsized opportunities to become as wealthy and successful as their parents. If life is a lottery then the children of the rich start off with a lot more tickets than the children of the poor - so it is not surprising that they generally win.The key point is that all these forms of assistance depend on parental wealth, but none are dependent on a transfer of assets after the parents' death. By the time that happens, these children are usually aged between 50 and 60 - already well into the gilded lives that their parents' money has opened to them, and often already 'independently' wealthy in ways that they have already endeavored to transmit onwards to their own children. The intergenerational transfer has already taken place.If this intergenerational transmission of unearned privilege is the problem one cares about, then the solution will have nothing to do with inheritance tax. The focus should be elsewhere.First, measures to prevent unfair and unjustified concentrations of wealth from being created in the first place. For example, much higher taxes on property and capital gains, and fewer of the loopholes that the slippery professional middle classes are so good at using to escape paying their fair share for the upkeep of the society that has given them so much.Second, measures to reduce the special advantages that people with money are now so easily able to buy for their children. For example, bans on unpaid internships, legacy admissions to universities (and perhaps elite universities in general, since they seem to have been entirely captured by the rich), and so on. Or at least, taxes on those purchases of privilege at rates high enough to make the self-serving behaviour of the rich serve the rest of us.II. Inheritances Actually Reduce Wealth InequalityMy point here is more technical, although rather obvious once noticed.Suppose that 1 person has assets valued at $1 billion. Then that person dies and the assets are inherited by the next generation. Will this increase the concentration of wealth in society?It is hard to see how.Suppose the billionaire had one child and left everything to them. Then that 'child' (who is by now late middle-aged) gets the billion dollars and wealth inequality is unchanged.Suppose instead that the billionaire had more than one child. Then the billion dollars will presumably be divided up between them (and perhaps others too, such as grandchildren and charitable foundations). In this case wealth inequality will actually decline as a result of inheritance. Since the rich tend to have more children than the average (because being rich means being able to afford expensive things without having to sacrifice anything important), most actual inheritances will be shared among multiple beneficiaries. Inheritances therefore usually reduce the concentration of wealth, whether or not they are taxed.The same goes for the merely upper middle-class rich, whose shares and large house in a good neighbourhood will be divided up between their children, creating a bonanza, but one split several ways.The diluting character of inheritance also applies to concentrations of economic power - which is often what people complaining about excessive concentrations of wealth are actually concerned about. For example, when the billionaire media mogul Rupert Murdoch retired he could use his huge holding of voting shares to appoint his favoured son, Lachlan, to take over running his media empire, with its profitable but obnoxious rightist leanings. But when Murdoch senior dies, Lachlan will likely lose his position and hence power, as all those voting shares will be split 4 ways with his other siblings (who don't particularly like him).***I have argued that taxes on inheritance substantially miss the point. They miss the moment when problematic transfers of intergenerational wealth actually take place. And they are not necessary to prevent wealth inequality from rising.Of course, this does not mean that inheritance tax can't play a role in reducing inequalities of wealth further. It is not unreasonable to want a society in which the Murdoch siblings in line for 25% each of their father's voting class shares get substantially less than that. Inheritance tax can also be thought of more conventionally, as just another way of raising money to fund government activities and social services, rather than as a device for social engineering.",

Every month, I will be sharing my thoughts and reflections about the books I read, which will hopefully fall under a wide range of genres and topics, as diversifying my reading and being able to discuss with others is one of the main objectives of this segment. If you have any thoughts or recommendations, feel free to let me know :)Albert Bartholomé. The Artist's Wife (Périe, 1849–1887) Reading, 1883.The Emperor of Gladness by Ocean Vuong ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.5 A novel that tells the story of a lost and depressed nineteen year old who, at the moment he decides that his life is no longer worth living, gets saved by an old Lithuanian woman with dementia in need of a caretaker.Ocean Vuong is undoubtedly one of my favorite authors, he has mastered the art of noticing the invisible, gracefully materializing it through his words. One of my favorite things about his writing style is that it often reads like poetry—which shouldn't be surprising as his first two published books are poetry collections (both of which I highly recommend)—all this to say that the emotional impact of his writing has been tenderly transformational, and this book was no exception.Without giving too much of the plot away, this is a story about showing up again and again, just to save each other. We find our characters in the forgotten, mundane, post-industrial town of East Gladness, a place where people seem to either escape from or get stuck in. On one side, this said group of characters is these diverse and beautifully flawed individuals, working at the franchise of a chain restaurant, making minimum wage. On the other side, there is Grazina, a demented Lithuanian widow, who is now being taken care of by Hai, a second-generation queer Vietnamese immigrant struggling with addiction.One of my biggest takeaways from this book is that service workers truly are the backbone of society. No matter how badly the world is falling apart, or how badly they themselves are falling apart, they will always be there. I'm sure I'm not the only one that got told when they were younger that they needed to work hard unless they wanted to end up working at McDonalds, how odd. When I think of service workers I think of dignity, perseverance, resilience, and a lot of patience.My rather high rating may be slightly biased—as I rated it largely based on personal enjoyment over objective quality—but this book meant to find me exactly when it did. It undoubtedly has its flaws, some of the chapters toward the middle feel a bit stagnant and some storylines remain slightly underdeveloped, but being honest, I did not mind as I savored every single word.I have understood that certain books are signs that I am connected to something larger than myself, in this book, I found so many coincidences and parallels between the characters and myself. One that particularly stood out was that Hai, the main character, was reading The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky, one of my all-time favorite books, and one that I read through a particularly challenging and complicated summer. One of the last quotes of the book is inspired by one in the Russian classic: \"But don't be afraid of life son, life is good when we do good things for each other\", which has come to be one of the biggest lessons that I've learned between that summer and this one. This book isn't about greatness, it's about finding it in smallness.Sula by Toni Morrison ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️A novel set in the years 1919 through 1965, telling the story of two black women, the complexities of their friendship, of their community, and the racism fueled reality they were forced to navigate throughout their contrasting lives.The anticipation felt when faced with an important piece of literature such as this one is so intense, that the fear of not getting it is almost equally as strong. This was my first Toni Morrison book, I had been putting it off for a couple of years for no apparent reason but—perhaps subconsciously—I knew I wasn't ready to get all of the topics explored in this novel. Now that I have finally read it, I know that even though I will never fully get what the black experience entails, I am at a place where I now get to understand it better.This is an infinitely rich book, where there are layers upon layers of symbolism living among the beautifully raw prose that it is filled with. It is a book that makes you uncomfortable, it makes you question not only your own perception of the bounds of race but also of the ones of good and evil. It folds the spectrum of this duality in a way that they get stuck together, leaving a sticky mess of ambiguity once you attempt to pull them apart.It is quite tricky to create a realistic depiction of what female friendship truly is like, with all of its intimacy, magic, and incongruence that gets all tangled up as the years go by. Sula and Nel's friendship was undoubtedly one of the most intriguing ones I have gotten the opportunity to read. If you have ever heard the saying \"We were girls together\" you can credit this beautiful classic for it—even though the original quote is \"We was girls together\".One cannot talk about Sula without mentioning its exploration of women's sexual freedom. Societal judgment is placed opposite sexual autonomy on the balance, leaving the reader to question which side's weight will determine the tipping point. This is done by carrying us through the ripples that an individual's acts can send through an entire community, and how they can eventually integrate into its fabric.This was not an easy read but a necessary one, I'm sure I'll come back to it some years down the road with more revelations and new perspectives. My only complaint is that I wish I could've spent more time with these characters, it felt like a compilation of glimpses into their realities made up by fleeting reminiscences. I understand that was the point, but it does leave you wanting more.Instead of Doomscrolling is a reader-supported publication.

These two things that have irrefutably transformed the way we get to see the world and its wars; nonetheless, I found it to be unfortunately more relevant than ever. Sontag takes the reader through a gruesome and violent journey through wars across the globe as photography began to play a role in these. Each stop of this journey has a cascade of complexities, everything from colonialism, propaganda, desensitization, cognitive dissonance, objectification, and so much more.Now that we have the world in our pockets, there is an entirely new layer to her arguments.

I know for a fact that I would see countless Palestinian families having to clickbait viewers into watching their video, to then ask for people to comment some ridiculous viral search term, such as \"Dubai chocolate milk\" to trick the algorithm into showing the video to more people. I have seen starving children, beheaded babies, limbless bodies, to then scroll and see someone on vacation, and then a multi-million dollar ad campaign, and then a book review—you get what I mean.This dystopian way in which we are consuming content is something disturbingly unprecedented. There is not necessarily a middleman anymore that gets to twist and weaponize violence for their own agenda—at least not exclusively—meaning we are now able to see victims document their own demise. We now have live access to thousands upon thousands of raw footage that allows us to see violence like never before, but this abundance and accessibility in mainstream media also results in apathy, as it is tangled in with mindless entertainment.The thing about images is that they are subjective and objective all at once. You cannot dispute what the image is depicting, but without a narrative, the viewer gets to fill in the gaps. It could be argued that in the age of AI and digital interventions, it's getting harder to know what's real and what's not; however, it all goes back to the same argument. In today's digital world, where disinformation is rampant, context is necessary to understand the images past the shock.This book was a harrowing reminder of the human condition and its capacity for evil. Though there was no clear thesis in my opinion, the breakdown she provided was incredibly well-rounded. I will now leave you with the following quote from the book as it sums up my conclusions about it: \" The problem is not that people remember through photographs, but that they remember only the photographs.\".The Tunnel by Ernesto Sabato ⭐️⭐️⭐️.5A dark psychological novel set in Argentina, where deranged painter Juan Pablo Castel narrates the events that led to him murdering of the only woman he felt understood by.In case you didn't know, I was born and raised in Colombia, so despite all of my content being in English, my first language is actually Spanish. I have distanced myself from my roots to escape from all of the limitations that come with them, but unfortunately, I have also neglected all of the wonderful things that they bring me; one of them being Latin American literature. As I am home for the summer, I decided to take a look at the bookshelves all over my house, which led me to find this book tucked away, still wrapped in plastic, from when I was supposed to read it back in high school.From the get-go, you know exactly how this book is going to end, which then leaves you no longer curious for the what, but rather for the why. In a way, Sabato's writing and character building were extremely reminiscent of Dostoevsky's, both masterminds of breaking open the psyche of an insufferable, dramatic, and morally questionable man. The main character of this book, Castel, is one of the clearest definitions of an unlikable, unreliable narrator I have ever seen.One of the things that really caught my eye is that Castel insists throughout his narration that he is retelling the story in an objective, non-biased way. I will not argue that he believes that he is, as he very clearly tells the story from the point of view of his reality. However, he cannot even fathom that the way he sees the world may not be the one irrefutable truth. This is one of his fundamental flaws; when he notices his projections of reality fracture, he loses all sense of control.This was a disturbingly accurate—perhaps hyperbolic—depiction of how the minds of manipulative, abusive, sociopathic men function when they are in a relationship with somebody. I kept rolling my eyes at his childish and ridiculous ploys, as well as at his blatant objectification and idealisation of women. I hated that I laughed at some of his behaviours because this is not just some outlandish fictional tale, but the reality of many women who are stuck in abusive relationships, and we all know how this one ended.As much as I despised his character, I did relate to him in a couple of ways. He is a deeply isolated, misunderstood person stuck in a tunnel, getting glimpses of the outside world and everyone living in it through a little window from afar. He remains hidden from the world in plain sight, longing and yearning to be understood, even if it is just by one person. He is stuck in a tunnel, but for him, there is no light at the end.Subscribe now",

And we have a doozy of a week to celebrate: self-improving AI, deployed iron-air batteries, AI designed gene editors, Figma's IPO, and some Zipline content. Couldn't think of a better way to celebrate.Let's get to it.Today's Weekly Dose is brought to you by... Stripe StartupsEvery venture-backed company — yes, you — should work with Stripe Startups.Stripe's mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and it's working. Last year, 1.3% of global GDP flowed through Stripe, over $1.4 trillion and growing. 78% of the Forbes AI 50 use Stripe's financial infrastructure to monetize faster, experiment with pricing, and grow revenue.As I wrote in my original Deep Dive, Stripe's strategy from the earliest days has been to make it as easy as possible for startups to begin accepting payments, and then grow with them as they get really big. Little companies become big companies become public companies. With Stripe Startups, they're making it even easier.Stripe Startups is the company's new program designed to support early-stage, venture-backed businesses as they build, iterate, and scale. Founders enrolled in Stripe Startups get access to credits to offset Stripe fees, expert insights, and a focused community of other founders building on Stripe.You're going to use Stripe anyway.

The improvement is slow for now, but undeniable. Developing superintelligence is now in sight.The age of Superintelligence is nigh. In a public memo, Mark Zuckerberg revealed that Meta has recently observed its AI self-improving, a key step in developing superintelligence. Self-improving AI means recursive progress, meaning the models can iteratively enhance their own capabilities without human intervention accelerating performance well beyond human-level.In sharing this update, Zuck also laid out Meta's AI business strategy called \"Personal Superintelligence\" or AI embedded in everyday devices (like AR glasses) that deeply understand and assist individuals. According to Zuck, unlike those big bad Other AI labs that just want to automate your work and steal your jobs (good framing, Meta PR), Personal Superintelligence is designed to empower billions of people to pursue their own goals using AI tailored to them.Meta's stock popped 10% Wednesday evening into Thursday (adding about ~1 Anthropic to its market cap), but it wasn't even on this news. They just, as they are wont to do, crushed earnings. And a company that is crushing earnings from its core business, is given a bit more (like hundreds of billions of dollars more) leash to pursue longer-term research initiatives that may not have immediate payback, like Personal Superintelligence.A few takes here:If Meta is observing self-improving AI, the other labs probably are not far behind.I am not sure I want to live in world of Reels powered by Personal Superintelligence, but hopefully an aligned Superintelligent AI will come up with other more fulfilling or productive ways to spend my time.With Meta's stock pumping and adding ~$175B overnight, Zuck's talent acquisition spree is looking a lot more reasonable.I have one basic rule that I live by: never doubt Zuck.Packy note: I'm mixed on this one! We included it because Zuck's vision for Personal Superintelligence is great, and he's pulled together an All-Star team to build it. BUT there's what Zuck says, and the job AI is currently doing for Meta. In its Q2 earnings Prepared Remarks, the company wrote: This is not great. Zuck is saying \"that superintelligence has the potential to begin a new era of personal empowerment where people will have greater agency to improve the world in the directions they choose,\" but it is hard to argue that souping up the algorithms to pull people even deeper into their Reels feeds gives people greater agency. It's the opposite. No one wants to spend 20% more time watching Reels. It wasn't as if that was peoples' goal but they just couldn't figure out how to do it until Meta's AI helped them spend 20% more time in the app. This is exactly what David Foster Wallace warned about: Like, at a certain point we're gonna have to build up some machinery, inside our guts, to help us deal with this. Because the technology is just gonna get better and better and better and better. And it's gonna get easier and easier, and more and more convenient, and more and more pleasurable, to be alone with images on a screen, given to us by people who do not love us but want our money. Which is all right. In low doses, right? but if that's the basic main staple of your diet, you're gonna die. In a meaningful way, you're going to die.As it stands, Meta is using regular AI to up the dose. Here's hoping he means what he says when and if his new team really does build Superintelligence. (2) Ore Energy connects world's first grid-connected iron-air battery in DelftCate Lawrence for Tech.EUOre Energy, a Netherlands-based energy startup pioneering iron-air long-duration energy storage, today announced that it has successfully connected its flagship iron-air battery system to the electric grid in the city of Delft — the first iron-air system to be grid-connected and fully operational anywhere in the world.Netherlands-based startup Ore Energy connected the world's first grid-ready iron-air battery system in Delft, offering up to 100 hours of clean energy storage using only iron, air, and water. Unlike lithium-ion systems, which max out around 4–8 hours, iron-air batteries allow for multi-day load shifting.Iron-air batteries store energy by using a simple chemical reaction: when the battery discharges, iron reacts with oxygen from the air and forms rust, releasing electricity. To recharge, electricity is used to reverse the reaction—turning the rust back into iron and storing energy again. It's kind of like breathing in and out, but with metal and air instead of lungs.Batteries are a key piece of the clean energy transition and they just keep getting better and cheaper. Iron-air batteries are even better: they have higher capacity and use cheap and abundant materials (like air and iron), which means places like the Netherlands and the U.S. are less reliant on the rare materials needed to power lithium-ion batteries.In simulations, Ore's system slashed renewable energy curtailment by 44% and reduced system-wide energy costs by up to 63%. The company has plans to scale to 50 GWh/year by 2030 and, unsurprisingly has to jump through a ton of EU regulatory hurdles to get there. In the U.S. the leading iron-air battery player is Form Energy, which has built some great infrastructure but, to my knowledge, has not yet deployed its batteries.(3) Design of highly functional genome editors by modelling CRISPR–Cas sequencesRuffolo et al in NatureHere, using large language models2 trained on biological diversity at scale, we demonstrate successful precision editing of the human genome with a programmable gene editor designed with artificial intelligence. To achieve this goal, we curated a dataset of more than 1 million CRISPR operons through systematic mining of 26 terabases of assembled genomes and metagenomes. We demonstrate the capacity of our models by generating 4.8× the number of protein clusters across CRISPR–Cas families found in nature and tailoring single-guide RNA sequences for Cas9-like effector proteins.Profluent Bio has released OpenCRISPR-1, the first gene editor designed entirely by an AI model (not discovered in nature or derived from a bacterial protein). The model, which was trained on over 1 million CRISPR systems mined from 26 terabases of genomic data, generated proteins with greater functional diversity than exists in the wild. OpenCRISPR-1 edits the human genome with precision equal to or better than SpCas9, but with fewer off-target effects and lower immunogenicity.Profluent says it's already being used in research and commercial applications, from drug discovery to cell therapies to crop engineering. The company's goal is to replace trial-and-error discovery with bespoke design using its steerable, general-purpose protein models. I don't know exactly what biotech and medicine will look like in the next 10–20 years, but I can say with a pretty high degree of certainty that it's going to make our current approaches look medieval.(4) Figma more than triples in NYSE debut after selling shares at $33Jordan Novet for CNBCFigma's first trade at $85 valued the company at about $50 billion. The stock, trading under ticker symbol FIG, was halted after it soared past $112.The IPO window is open, baby. Figma, the infrastructure that supports the Not Boring design engine, priced its IPO at $33, for a market cap right below the $20 billion price tag for which Adobe tried to acquire it before Lina Khan spoiled the fun. Whatever, same price, no blood, no foul. Then! As Bill Gurley clutched his stomach, put the back of his hand to his forehead, and fainted onto the couch like a cartoon character (presumably), it first traded hands at $85 before rocketing to $112, getting halted, opening back up, soaring to $122, and closing at $117.59. At that price, its market cap is $69 billion (nice), or 3.46 Linas.In pre-market trading this morning, it's at $138.48, $81.5 billion or 4.07 Linas. A few weeks ago, we covered Figma filing its S-1. It was going public. We were optimistic but we still didn't know how the market would react. Now we know. The market wants high-growth, high-margin, AI-exposed, founder-led tech stocks. Circle ripped. Figma ripped. If you're a strong tech company, the market wants to meet you. This is good for the venture market. LPs will be getting some real liquidity, and some hope that more is to come, which they can redeploy into venture, which means more companies fixing more problems (someone please fix Newark Airport, eg) and increasing humanity's means. And if you want to squint with us and get really optimistic, this may be the biggest wealth creation event for good designers in world history; billions and billions of dollars with which to make the world a little more beautiful. (5) ZiplineFrom The Abunadnace InstituteWe were promised flying cars; instead, we got flying delivery drones.Zipline is one of our favorite companies. It's been grinding away at a massive, hard problem for well over a decade: making vital and wanted product delivery cheaper, more accessible, and cleaner. It started with the vital products, delivering blood and other medicines throughout Rwanda via drones, and that business has since expanded globally.Now it's making a massive push into wanted products: quick commerce and food delivery, right here in the U.S. It even kicked off a partnership with Walmart a couple of months ago to offer fast (<30 min), autonomous drone delivery of thousands of products directly to customers' homes.Zipline is one of those companies that, on paper, makes so much sense. Why wouldn't we want faster, cheaper, cleaner delivery of goods directly to our homes? Why would we want to lock up billions of human hours each year simply delivering food and convenience store items?The demand for Zipline, in theory, has always been there. But now the company is starting to work through the execution and regulatory hurdles that have slowed it down in the past. Drones are getting cheaper, safer, and better, and the software running them is getting smarter. And now the FAA is starting to take notice: Zipline has amassed millions of miles of pristine safety data.Demand + technology advancements + regulatory compliance might just = fast, nearly free delivery of Chipotle for Dano.s/o to the Abundance Institute (where Packy is an Senior Advisor) and Jason Carman for putting together this awesome video on Zipline.And as for me, I'll be ziplining right onto my couch for the weekend.Bonus: Means and MeaningPacky here. I wrote one of my favorite essays I've written in a while this week, and sent it out at a weird time mid-morning Tuesday. It's probably best read on a weekend morning with a big cup of coffee and a nice view. Enjoy! Have a great weekend y'all.Thanks to Stripe Startups for sponsoring. Love these guys, we don't say that enough.We'll be back in your inbox next week.Thanks for reading,Packy + Dan",

      "title": "Introducing Noema VI: Paradigm Shifts",
      "link": "https://www.noemamag.com/introducing-noema-vi-paradigm-shifts",
      "author": "Nathan Gardels",
      "publishedAt": "2025-08-01T12:50:45.000Z",
      "content": "When a concept that organizes our reality is replaced by an entirely different and incommensurate worldview, it is called a “paradigm shift.”The theme of this edition of Noema was conceived in early 2024. At that time, we had in mind the epochal shift from the paradigm of globalization, in which markets, trade and technology cross borders, to “the Planetary,” where we recognize that the whole Earth system embeds and entangles human civilization in its habitat.This deeper awareness has been enabled by the emergence of a technological exoskeleton of satellites, sensors and cloud computation that expands the heretofore limited scope of human understanding of the world, repositioning our place in the natural order. Neither above nor apart from nature, we have now come to realize we are part and parcel of one interdependent organism comprised of multiple intelligences striving for sustainable equilibrium.The disclosure of climate change as a destabilizing consequence of human endeavor was enabled in the first place by planetary-scale computation. This capacity holds out the evolutionary prospect that human, machine and Earth intelligence might one day merge into a kind of planetary sapience that restores and maintains the ecological balance.As we have written often in Noema, this conceptual reorientation would entail a redefinition of what realism means in geopolitics. This new condition calls not for the old “realpolitik” that seeks to secure the interests of nation-states against each other but for a “Gaiapolitik” aimed at securing a livable biosphere for all.As logically compelling as this case for planetary realism may be, the paradigm shift underway is going in the opposite direction. Instead of the global interconnectivity forged in recent decades maturing into a planetary perspective, it is breaking up into a renewed nationalism more emphatically sovereigntist than before the advent of globalization.In short, the prevailing political temperament around the world today is out of sync with the planetary imperative. This does not diminish its reality but, for the moment, eclipses and derails its emergence as the conscious organizing principle of human civilization.The Last Sigh Of Liberal UniversalismThe paradigm shift we are witnessing today not only marks a move away from a planetary awareness but also signals the last sigh of liberal universalism as the dominant governing philosophy of the postwar order since 1945.The rules-based liberal international order, underwritten and guaranteed for decades by American might, has been consigned to the ash can of history by the summary defection of its founding architect from its terms and premises.Under President Donald Trump and his allies, America has effectively joined the revisionist powers of China and Russia by baldly asserting sovereigntist self-interest unencumbered by rules that also encompass the interests of others.Tariff walls, outright trade wars and unraveling alliances are supplanting the expansive web of global commerce, Western unity and cultural cross-fertilization that characterized times only recently. In a further break from the established order, Team Trump openly contemplates its own Anschluss of other people’s territory in Greenland, the Panama Canal and even Canada, instead of expressing outrage at China’s desire to take Taiwan, Russia’s bloody attempt to seize Ukraine or Israel’s increasing occupation of the Palestinian territories.As Francis Fukuyama and Niall Ferguson discuss in a collage of commentary in this Noema edition, these developments portend the return to a world not unlike that of the 19th century, when the great powers carved out exclusive domains of influence.The obvious great powers that would constitute a world apportioned in this way are China and Russia, both grasping at Eurasia, plus the United States and India. Whether Europe falls within the American sphere of influence depends on its capacity to cohere as a continental entity and find its identity as an alternative within a West that is fracturing under the strain of America’s revisionist turn.Since the future appears to be taking us back to the 19th century, one cannot say we are in “uncharted territory.” On the contrary, we’ve been down this path before and know how it led to world wars that the global rules-based order, for all its well-known faults, was meant to avoid repeating.The “Strong Gods” Of Family, Faith And Nation Challenge The Open SocietyOn the American home front, and increasingly elsewhere in the West, it appears the “strong gods” of family, faith and nation are prevailing over the culturally liberal sentiments of an open society.When there is no common agreement on what constitutes the good life, culture is politicized. As Alexandre Lefebvre argues in Noema, who gets to define “the good life” has become the central political question of our time. As in China, Russia, Iran or Turkey, governing authorities in the West are increasingly seeking to assign the moral substance of their vision to the state in place of the neutral proceduralism of liberal regimes that, at least in theory, embrace the diversity of all values without favor. As the ascendant traditionalists see it, this rights-based liberalism grants a kind of converse moral substance to the state by virtue of the permissive openness it invites, nourishes and protects.In many ways, liberalism was bound to fail just as Marxism did, and for the same reason. Marxism lacked a theory of politics that accommodated diverse constituencies because it assumed the universality of the interests of one class. Similarly, liberalism has falsely assumed its own universality, believing that there can be a consensus on only one conception of “the good life.” In reality, where some see declaring gender identity as the positive freedom to pursue self-realization, others see it as the corrosion of traditional Christian morality.Like the British philosopher John Gray, Lefebvre suggests that the liberalism of the future may well entail a constitutionally grounded “modus vivendi” of autonomous jurisdictions as one way to keep the civil peace in diverse societies.What is stunning in this context is how rapidly the America that elected Trump has tilted toward illiberal democracy under his tumultuous reign. Team Trump has robustly pursued retribution against political enemies, scorned universities as “the enemy,” moved to dismantle the administrative state and climate policies, demeaned the judicial system and cultivated crony corruption. Moreover, in the Orwellian name of free speech, Trump insists on ideological conformity across the board, from college students to corporate law firms.To base the idea of democracy solely on elections invites this kind of illiberalism because it implies that majoritarian rule is all that is necessary for legitimacy. But, as the American founding fathers well understood, the will of the majority does not embrace all interests in a society, which must be protected equally. That is the reason for constitutional rule as the founding principle of a liberal polity.In constitutional theory, the imposition of limitations and restraints — the “negative” — is what prevents the majority from absolute domination. It is the negative that makes the Constitution and the “positive” that makes government. One is the power of acting, the other the power of amending or arresting action. The two combined make a constitutional government.It is this governing arrangement that made America great. The biggest danger of Making America Great Again is that a movement that believes it is the embodiment of the will of the majority will cast aside any constraints on its power as a contrivance by the elites of the ancien régime to keep the masses down.In Niall Ferguson’s contribution to Noema, the historian raises the specter that “history was always against any republic lasting 250 years. This republic is in its late republican phase, with the intimations of empire much more visible.”The Prospect Of “More Than Human” IntelligenceAs politicized cultural battles and the churning geopolitical economy further unfold, a paradigm shift of a significance similar to planetary awareness is taking place that will redefine what it means to be human.Across the sciences, we are coming to understand the self-organizing principle of “computation” as the building block of all forms of budding intelligence, from primitive cells to generative AI. This process involves learning from the environment, assembling information and arranging it by sharing functional instructions through “copying and pasting” code, so that an organism can develop, reproduce and sustain itself.As Google’s Blaise Agüera y Arcas and James Manyika write in this issue, “computing existed in nature long before we built the first ‘artificial computers.’ … Understanding computing as a natural phenomenon will enable fundamental advances not only in computer science and AI, but also in physics and biology.”More than half a century ago, they note, pioneering computer scientists had the intuition that organic and inorganic intelligence follow the same set of rules for development. “John von Neumann,” write the authors, “realized that for a complex organism to reproduce, it would need to contain instructions for building itself, along with a machine for reading and executing those instructions.” The technical requirements for that “universal constructor” in nature — the tape-like instructions of DNA — “correspond precisely to the technical requirements for the earliest computers.”“Life,” they continue, “is computational because its existence over time depends on growth, healing or reproduction, and computation itself must evolve to support these essential functions.”Grasping the correspondence with natural computation and learning from it, they believe, will render AI “brainlike” as it further evolves along the path from mimicking neural computation to predictive intelligence, general intelligence and, ultimately, collective intelligence. “Brains, AI agents and societies can all become more capable through increased scale. However, size alone is not enough. Intelligence is fundamentally social, powered by cooperation and the division of labor among many agents.”In short, as philosopher of technology Tobias Rees also argues in this issue, the evolution of computation as a symbiosis of human and machine will cause us to rethink what it means to be human as, for the first time in history, a “more than human” intelligence emerges on our planet.These contradictions and crosscurrents of the profound paradigm shifts we are living through all at once mark what future historians will surely describe as the Age of Upheaval.

      "content": "Statue of limitations?Note: Trump announced a bunch more tariffs, some very high, late yesterday. Everything suggests that this is the new normal, unless the courts rule (as they should) that everything has been illegal. I'll have a full analysis of the economics of Smoot-Hawley 2.0 in Sunday's primer.As I said yesterday, Donald Trump isn't \"winning his trade war.\" He's imposing a lot of tariffs, and so far nobody has stopped him even though his actions are clearly illegal. But \"winning\" a trade war, if it means anything, means using tariffs to extract meaningful concessions from other countries. And while some major trading partners, notably the European Union, are humoring Trump by pretending to make concessions, when you look at what they're actually doing it's just vaporware.Is Trump an incompetent negotiator, easily hoodwinked? Maybe. But more fundamentally, he just doesn't have the juice. The U.S. market is big, and denying other countries access to that market hurts them. But it doesn't hurt them that much, and anyone imagining that America can use the threat of tariffs to force major policy changes abroad is suffering from delusions of grandeur.Consider the case of Brazil.In some ways Trump's dealings with Brazil are exceptional, even in the context of his unprecedented break with 90 years of U.S. tariff policy. For one thing, Brazil is facing 50 percent tariffs — considerably higher than anyone else.For another, Trump's demands on Brazil are different in kind from what he's demanding from anyone else. The European Union and Japan have been targeted because of alleged unfair trade practices, although exactly what these practices are has never been clear. Canada is being targeted over claims that it's a major source of fentanyl, which is a lie but would be a real grievance if it were true. But Trump has explicitly linked tariffs on Brazil to the nation's temerity in trying Jair Bolsonaro, the former president, for attempting to overturn an election he lost.So Trump is an enemy of democracy and accountability for would-be authoritarians, but we knew that. Beyond that, it's utterly illegal for a U.S. president to use tariffs in an attempt to influence another nation's internal politics. Presidents do have considerable discretion in tariff-setting, but there are a limited number of allowed reasons for imposing temporary tariffs:· To give a U.S. industry a breathing space against an import surge (Section 201)· To preserve an industry essential to national security (Section 232)· Unfair foreign practices (Section 301 and anti-dumping duties)Presidents can also claim additional powers during an economic emergency — but Trump keeps insisting that the U.S. economy is doing great, which presumably means that there is no emergency.Now, just about everything Trump has been doing on trade is illegal, but in the case of Brazil it's completely blatant. I don't think even the most cleverly unscrupulous lawyer could find anything in U.S. law that gives a president the right to impose tariffs on a nation, not for economic reasons, but because he doesn't like what its judiciary is doing. (Famous last words?)So the confrontation with Brazil illustrates in especially stark form the lawlessness of Trump's tariff spree. It also, however, illustrates the gap between the amount of power Trump apparently thinks he has and the reality.I keep seeing articles saying that the United States is Brazil's second-most-important trading partner. That's not even true, unless you ignore the fact that when it comes to international trade the European Union lives up to its name, presenting a unified front on tariffs. In any case, you should realize that we really don't loom very large in Brazil's overall export picture. Here's the breakdown for last year:Source: International Monetary FundDo Trump and his advisors really think they can use tariffs to bully a nation of more than 200 million people into dropping its efforts to defend democracy, when it sells 88 percent of its exports to countries other than the United States?Wait, there's more: The Trump administration has exempted fresh orange juice — 90 percent of which is imported from Brazil — from its tariff. Apparently we need what Brazil sells us. And this is an implicit admission that, contrary to Trump's constant assertions, U.S. consumers rather than foreign exporters pay tariffs.What some of us want to know is why orange juice, which people can live without, is getting a break, while coffee, an absolutely essential nutrient, isn't.Sure enough, the tariffs seem to be backfiring politically. In an echo of what happened in Canada, where Trump's pressure clearly saved the incumbent Liberal government from massive electoral losses, the threats against Brazil have done wonders for the popularity of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the current president:Source: The EconomistAs I said, Trump may think he can rule the world, but he doesn't have the juice, orange or otherwise. In fact, he is unintentionally giving the world a lesson in the limits of U.S. power.MUSICAL CODA",

This is not directly relevant to work, but our editorial assistant Ben is the only person I've ever met who can run marathons while being extremely chill about it, to the point of barely even mentioning that it's happening. Which I think is reflective of the combination of work ethic and unflappability that's made him such a great community manager in the comments section, and I'm incredibly pleased that he'll be continuing in that capacity part-time, even as he moves on to other things. All of our Slow Boring editorial assistants have been excellent researchers and have really grown as writers, but Ben also took the moderating to a new level with his skill and discretion. He'll be missed around the office, but he's still a valued member of the team and community. And during his last week full-time at Slow Boring, he's answering our commenters' most pressing questions. Drew: Ben, what are you doing/studying in Taiwan?Many people in my life are wondering the same thing, given the fact that I have zero Mandarin language abilities and have visited the entire Asian continent one time for one week. Here's the literal answer: My girlfriend is taking a year off her PhD to enroll in an intensive Mandarin language program in Taiwan, and I wanted to find an excuse to join her. So, I found an English-language Master's program in Political Economy at National Taiwan University. My plan is to take some classes, work part-time here at Slow Boring, and find some more freelance writing opportunities (if anyone has leads on this, let me know!) I'm excited for my sojourn to Taiwan. It sits before me as a black box of educational, unique, and likely quite confusing life experiences; I will savor every moment of it. That said, I did anguish over the decision for quite a while.I've geared my whole career towards American politics, and I couldn't have dreamed up a better professional opportunity than working here at Slow Boring. Leaving DC, just as I was gaining a small toe hold in the political writing world, was daunting. But older professionals in my life gave me some helpful advice. One, the time away ultimately won't amount to that long in the grand scheme of things. And two, legitimately unique career or educational experiences are nearly always additive to your resume, even if it's ancillary to the job you're applying for. That second reason rang especially true to me. The person who hired me for my first job out of college said my resume stood out because I spent a summer as an introductory announcer at a DC comedy club that she frequently attended. I remember Kate asking me about an unpublished children's book I wrote during my job interview here. Of course, none of those were the leading reasons why I was hired. But in the job market of US politics, career trajectories can feel kind of interchangeable. It helps to stand out a bit. Taiwan is a fascinating country with tons of geopolitical salience. I'm already learning everything I can about its government structure, history, and hot domestic political debates. And I'd love to find some writing opportunities while I'm living there. But even if it's a bit of a dud, I find it impossible to imagine that I'll regret doing it. Lisa J Thanks for being a good humored but still effective mod. And it was a pleasure to read your contributions- and meet you briefly at the DC meetups.Now please give us olds the real scoop on Gen Z and dating/steady relationships.

Elliott MorrisYet despite this narrow ballot advantage, the Democrats are, if anything, viewed even less favorably than Trump. G. Elliott Morris' poll aggregator has Dems looking more unpopular than they've been since the early years after 9/11:Source: G. Elliott MorrisThis comes even as some polls show that approval of the GOP has stabilized and even risen slightly since 2012:Source: WSJIn his post, Morris points out that some of Dems' extraordinary unfavorability is due to left-wingers being dissatisfied with the party:In our Strength In Numbers/Verasight polling, there is a large mass of left-leaning Democrats who are bringing down the party's favorability rating. In our data, about 20% of the Democrats who call themselves \"very liberal\" have an unfavorable view of the party. That compares to just 8% of \"very conservative\" Republicans who view the GOP negatively...In other words, the Democratic Party's favorability rating is so much lower than Republicans' almost entirely because of dissatisfaction from in-party ideologues.If this is true, it means the Dems aren't in as bad shape electorally as the headline approval numbers might imply. After all, on election day, most leftists will end up holding their noses and voting for the Democrats. But that said, I'm not convinced that the Dems' unpopularity is mainly due to leftists. A recent Wall Street Journal poll found that when it comes to the issues — even ones where people disapprove of Trump — Democrats are losing to Republicans in the court of public opinion:Source: WSJDemocrats are still favored on health care and vaccines, but on all the big important issues — on the economy, inflation, immigration, foreign policy, and even tariffs — Americans say they trust Congressional Republicans more. The 17-point gap on immigration and the 24-point gap on illegal immigration are particularly galling, since they come despite the recent backlash against ICE and mass deportations. That's highly unlikely to be the result of leftist defection from the Dems, since leftists are highly unlikely to endorse things like mass deportation or Trump's strong support for Israel. Instead, the public's preference for Congressional Republicans on the issues probably just reflects moderates who trust the GOP to do things that are more in alignment with what they want. Then there's party identification. A recent Pew survey shows how since the pandemic, fewer Americans are identifying as Democrats, even as more identify as Republicans:Source: PewThe shift looks similar among all races, genders, and ages; in fact, it's bigger among nonwhites than among whites. This doesn't look like the Democrats being punished by their base for being too moderate. It looks like the country slowly turning away from the Democrats in general. Read more",

      "content": "On a quiet June morning in Dudran, a remote village in the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir, the stillness is broken only by the rustle of the breeze, the gurgle of mountain streams, and the lively chirping of birds. Amid this calm, Mohammad Aamir walks steadily, balancing a deaag, a large metal vessel, brimming with fresh milk. He is headed toward the village’s traditional cooling cave, locally known as a dodh daaer or dodh khot, a centuries-old, stone-lined chamber fed by icy spring water. He pulls open the wooden doors of the cooling cave, their hinges creaking softly. Carefully, he places the metal vessel inside, nestling it among the cool stone walls. Then, with practiced ease, he places a small rock on top of the lid to keep it firmly in place, an old trick passed down through generations to secure the milk as it chills in the natural spring-cooled chamber. Mohammad Aamir closing the dodh khot. Credit: Safina Nabi Families in Dudran have long used these natural refrigeration systems to store milk, butter and cheese, preserving their dairy without the need for electricity, even during the hottest summer days. This simple, sustainable cooling method offers a promising model for remote and off-grid communities where electricity and modern refrigeration are scarce or unreliable. By harnessing natural spring water and subterranean stone structures, the caves maintain consistently low temperatures without any energy consumption or carbon emissions. “We have around eight or nine dodh khots here,” Aamir explains. “Each one can hold about 10 to 12 large metal vessels, though some caves can fit more; it depends on the size of the spring and the structure we’re able to build around it. The layout is usually shaped by how the water flows beneath.” Credit: Safina Nabi Dudran’s cooling caves hold metal vessels, each covered with a small rock to keep the lid firmly in place — an old trick passed down through generations to secure the milk as it chills in the natural spring-cooled chamber. The village’s eldest resident, Mohammad Yaqoob Sheikh, is known for his deep knowledge of Dudran, its history and the traditional cooling caves. His modest home — built entirely from stone, mud and timber — is located up a steep, winding path. Inside, the scent of woodsmoke lingers in the air. A few women move about quietly, one tending to a child, another crouched near the hearth preparing Haakh (collard greens), a local dish, in a traditional pot. Weighed down by negative news? Our smart, bright, weekly newsletter is the uplift you’ve been looking for. [contact-form-7] “These caves have been here since my childhood, and my father used to tell me they were here in his time too,” Sheikh explains from where he is resting on his bed. “Our forefathers came and settled in this village. I am the 10th generation. We’ve always reared cows, buffaloes and cattle, and milk has always been abundant. From the beginning, the dodh daaer have been here.” Sheikh’s words not only speak of tradition but are also echoed in the name of the place itself, which reflects its rich tradition of dairy production: Dud means milk in Kashmiri, and ran means village. Together, Dudran literally translates to “the milk village.” Mohammad Yaqoob Sheikh, the eldest person in the village, is known for his deep knowledge of its history. Credit: Safina Nabi For the people of Dudran, this practice is not just rooted in heritage, it’s a response to daily realities. Power cuts are frequent, and the cold caves offer both sustainability and security. Not one of the village’s roughly 150 households owns a refrigerator. By avoiding electric refrigerators, Dudran is also minimizing its climate footprint, saving an estimated 7,100 kilograms of carbon emissions annually across households. This makes the caves an unexpected model for low-tech sustainability in a high-altitude region shaped by conflict, remoteness and resilience. Himanshu Dixit, program associate at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a public policy think tank in India, highlights the broader value of such systems: “Practices like dodh khots in Dudran are carbon neutral, they don’t require any external energy for preservation of dairy products,” he explains. “These are highly specialized adaptive practices for cooling, evolved to suit the unique topography and climate.” Credit: Safina Nabi “Our forefathers came and settled in this village. I am the 10th generation. We’ve always reared cows, buffaloes and cattle, and milk has always been abundant. From the beginning, the dodh daaer have been here.” –Mohammad Yaqoob Sheikh The use of the caves goes beyond dairy, reflecting the community’s deep trust in this natural cooling method for preserving a variety of perishable goods. “We don’t just store milk, butter, and cheese in the caves,” explains Bilal Ahmed Sheikh, another villager. “During Bakr Eid, we also keep meat in the caves, and sometimes we store perishable vegetables like tomatoes there as well.” Dudran’s caves could be adapted in other remote regions facing limited electricity and refrigeration challenges. Similar high-altitude and off-grid areas like Ladakh, the Himalayas of Nepal and Bhutan, northern Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Andes and parts of sub-Saharan Africa could benefit from this low-tech method to preserve food, medicine and vaccines. Dixit offers a broader perspective on integrating such solutions into national and global strategies. “Nature-based approaches are an important area to pursue to reduce our dependence on energy-based technologies and systems. When used together, they can complement each other to reduce overall carbon emissions and make us resilient,” he says. “To that extent, [these] approaches have a role to play in India’s broader strategies for sustainable cooling and climate commitments.” Wait, you're not a member yet?

What makes the cooling cave system powerful is its simplicity: It relies not on machines but on nature itself. What began as a necessity in a remote Himalayan village now demonstrates that sometimes, innovation in climate resilience doesn’t require new technology, but rather a return to old wisdom.

And it wasn't directly about philosophy. It was actually about taking different routes, whether you stay on the interstate highways, which are pretty quicker, more direct in many cases, but also kind of boring, even mind numbing to drive on. And the alternative is to take what we often call the scenic route, where you're driving through towns and perhaps you don't have as many lanes, but it's more interesting to drive in and to look around at as you are making your path.And here's how the conversation went. Somebody was talking about driving up to Door County, which is a pretty ritzy and well-known vacation spot here in southern Wisconsin. It's actually past Green Bay. If you've ever seen the map of Wisconsin, you're going up that little finger that comes off. And it's very much, in my point of view, like Montauk and other parts of Long Island in in New York where the Hamptons are out there.

But if they could reflect on what is in their collective interest, the set of all predators on an isolated island should want to avoid killing all of the island's prey. And even in a famine, all the farmers on such an island should want to avoid eating all of their seed corn.Human cultures naturally try to give members strong attachments to and confidence in those culture's morals. This confidence helps in fighting rival cultures. For example, it makes members disgusted at other cultures, and so willing to fight them and not be converted to them. Also, culture members can show loyalty to each other via their confidence in its morals.But, as with animal predators, if predatory cultures, and the people in them, could step back and reflect on their collective interest, they should want to avoid killing off all other cultures. As that would result in too little cultural variety to make for a healthy cultural evolution environment. That one winning culture would then drift and decay into maladaption. And this seems to actually be happening today; most of the world is merging into a global monoculture that is drifting badly. The biggest way that cultures induce member confidence is via moral overconfidence. We are reasonably well-calibrated about the relative value of our culture's manners, languages, laws, buildings, food, art, institutions, etc. We understand that these are complicated and have context dependent value. And we get that our versions may not be best, and that a lot of context and randomness went into which versions our cultures chose.But when it comes to morals, we forget most of this subtly. We see our culture's morals as simple, clearly better, with a value that depends little on context. Instead of seeing our culture's morals as practical context-dependent and rather-random evolved strategies to make our culture more biologically adaptive, we instead see them as sacred truths the universe has revealed to us. We just ignore what the complex context dependent and changing history of our morals suggests about the confidence we can reasonably place in them.If people were rational, we might cut cultural drift just by explaining to them that they are badly mistaken on one key fact: they are crazy overconfident in their morals. Different cultures have different morals, and you have at best only weak reasons to see your culture's versions as best. Your naive predator instinct is have your culture's morals conquer the world, and get everyone to share them, but the world needs far more moral variety than that if it is to continue to evolve and adapt to its many challenges and changes.",

      "content": "[see footnote 4 for conflicts of interest]In 2021, Genomic Prediction announced the first polygenically selected baby.When a couple uses IVF, they may get as many as ten embryos. If they only want one child, which one do they implant? In the early days, doctors would just eyeball them and choose whichever looked healthiest. Later, they started testing for some of the most severe and easiest-to-detect genetic disorders like Down Syndrome and cystic fibrosis1. The final step was polygenic selection - genotyping each embryo and implanting the one with the best genes overall. Best in what sense? Genomic Prediction claimed the ability to forecast health outcomes from diabetes to schizophrenia. For example, although the average person has a 30% chance of getting type II diabetes, if you genetically test five embryos and select the one with the lowest predicted risk, they'll only have a 20% chance2. Since you're taking the healthiest of many embryos, you should expect a child conceived via this method to be significantly healthier than one born naturally. Polygenic selection straddles the line between disease prevention and human enhancement.In 2023, Orchid Health entered the field. Unlike Genomic Prediction, which tested only the most important genetic variants, Orchid offers whole genome sequencing, which can detect the de novo3 mutations involved in autism, developmental disorders, and certain other genetic diseases.Critics accused GP and Orchid of offering \"designer babies\", but this was only true in the weakest sense - customers couldn't \"design\" a baby for anything other than slightly lower risk of genetic disease. These companies refused to offer selection on \"traits\" - the industry term for the really controversial stuff like height, IQ, or eye color. Still, these were trivial extensions of their technology, and everybody knew it was just a matter of time before someone took the plunge.Last month, a startup called Nucleus took the plunge. They had previously offered 23andMe style genetic tests for adults. Now they announced a partnership with Genomic Prediction focusing on embryos. Although GP would continue to only test for health outcomes, you could forward the raw data from GP to Nucleus, and Nucleus would predict extra traits, including height, BMI, eye color, hair color, ADHD, IQ, and even handedness.Sample Nucleus results.And this week, Herasight4 entered the space with the most impressive disease risk scores yet, an IQ predictor worth 6-95 extra points, and a series of challenges to competitors, whom they call out for insufficient scientific rigor. Their most scathing attack is on Nucleus itself, accusing its predictions of being misleading and unreliable.Let's start with the science, then move on to the companies and see if we can litigate their dispute.In Theory, All Of This Should WorkPolygenic embryo screening is a natural extension of two well-validated technologies: genetic testing of embryos, and polygenic prediction of traits in adults.Genetic testing of embryos has been done for decades, usually to detect chromosomal abnormalities like Down Syndrome or simple single-gene disorders like cystic fibrosis. It's challenging - you need to take a very small number of cells (often only 5-10) from a tiny proto-placenta that may not have many cells to spare, and extract a readable amount of genetic material from this limited sample - but there are known solutions that mostly work.But most traits are polygenic, requiring information about thousands or tens of thousands of genes to predict. These are too complicated to understand fully at current levels of technology, but some studies have chipped away at the problem and gotten a partial understanding. Often this looks like being able to predict a few percent of the variance in a trait, and determine whether someone's genetic risk is slightly higher or lower than average.Polygenic prediction of traits in adults is still young and full of hidden pitfalls. Last month, we discussed how some early studies unknowingly conflated direct genetic effects and various confounders6 - for example, they tended to pick up on genes associated with well-off ethnic groups or families who had good health outcomes for social reasons. Pinpointing the direct component requires an additional step where researchers validate their algorithms within families (for example, on pairs of siblings where one has a higher polygenic score than the other) to see how much predictive power remains. This is especially important for embryo selection companies, whose entire value proposition depends on comparing two genomes from the same family. How have they done? It depends on the number of embryos they have to work with; the more embryos, the better you can do by selecting the best.Herasight's numbers on how breast cancer risk goes down with number of embryos used in selection. A typical round of IVF produces 1-10 embryos (younger women usually = more). Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (prevalence: 10%) may get as many as 20. For more, you will probably need to do multiple IVF rounds.Here is a table of different companies' reported risk reductions, slightly adjusted7 for different reporting conventions but otherwise taking all claims at face value (we'll talk about how wise that is later).Relative risk reduction for five conditions (gray = no data / disputed data). Here baseline is for embryos neither of whose parents have the condition. GP and Orchid both say their technology has improved since reporting these numbers and they will report better numbers soon. GP numbers are not within-family validated and might be lower if they were.Absolute risk after selection for five conditions (gray = no data / disputed data), ibid.Some people might genuinely want to select on a single condition. For example, people with a strong family history of schizophrenia might want to minimize the chance of their children getting the disease; for these people, reducing schizophrenia risk by 58% (while keeping everything else constant) sounds pretty good.Everyone else probably wants a generically healthy embryo with low risk of all conditions. Exactly how this works depends on the customer's own values - would they prefer an embryo with lower cancer risk to one who will have fewer heart attacks? - and the exact benefits will depend on how parents make that decision. Genomic Prediction and Herasight try to help by providing semi-objective measures of which embryo is overall healthiest according to different conditions' effects on longevity and patient-rated quality of life. For Genomic Prediction, that's the \"embryo health score\" If you selected the single highest-health-score embryo from a set of five, here's how they'd do:For Herasight, it's a \"polygenic longevity index\". They don't give exact risk reduction numbers for each disease, saying that it depends too much on a couple's specific family history, but say that most people gain 1-4 years of healthy life (when I test it on a set of twenty embryos, the the healthiest gets an extra 1.66 years). How much would you pay to give your children an extra 1-4 years of healthy life?This is no longer a hypothetical question. Here are the costs of the companies in this space:Is it worth it?If: You're already doing IVFThe claimed risk reductions are accurateYou value your kids' health about as much as your ownYou have a low time discount rate.You're well-off enough that these aren't extraordinary sums of money for youYou're okay using expected utility calculations where a 50% chance of preventing X is half as good as fully preventing X. ...then I'll go out on a limb and say yeah, obviously it's worth it.Consider e.g. Genomic Prediction, which costs $3,250 for five embryos and claims to lower absolute risk of Type 2 diabetes by 12%. That implies that not getting Type 2 diabetes is worth $27,000. Ask anybody dealing with regular insulin injections (let alone limb amputations) whether it would be worth $27,000 to wave a magic wand and not have Type 2 diabetes! It's not a hard question! And that's just one of a dozen conditions you can lower the risk for! Other ones, like not getting breast cancer, might be so valuable that it's hard to even attach numbers!(but maybe the low time discount rate is a mistake? Suppose you invest the $3,250 in an index fund that makes 7% over inflation, then give it to your future child when they turn 45 (average age of type 2 diabetes diagnoses). Now it's worth $75,000. Is this the \"true\" cost of the intervention? Does it matter that this counterfactual is fake and most people don't do this?)What about IQ? Six extra IQ points (Herasight's estimate with five embryos) is about a quarter of the gap between the average person and the average Ivy League student. The benefits of intelligence are hard to quantify, but it's been shown to have probably-causal positive effects on income, mortality, and achievement. Probably the income effects alone make up for the cost of intervention - again assuming total parent-child altruism and low discount rate8. So if we accept all of these claims and assumptions, the choice seems obvious. It's probably even obvious for governments to pay for all citizens to get these, given how much they'd save on health care costs.In Practice, It's ComplicatedCritics have raised both scientific and ethical objections to polygenic embryo screening.Most significantly, it's been condemned by various bodies including the Society For Psychiatric Genetics, the European Society of Human Genetics, and the Behavioral Genetics Society. Their statements are . . . not good. They tend towards vague language about how people are more than just their genes, or how no genetic test can be perfect, or how embryo screening is not exactly the same thing as some other form of screening which has a longer history and more proponents. \"Although in general higher scores mean you are more likely to have a condition, many healthy people will have high scores; others might develop the condition even with a low score\", says the Society for Psychiatric Genetics, as if they have just blown the lid off some dastardly conspiracy. \"Screening embryos for psychiatric conditions may increase stigma surrounding these diagnoses\", they continue - an objection which, taken seriously, could be used to ban every form of medical treatment. We will mostly ignore these people and try to imagine the objections that mildly competent critics might raise, some of which will coincidentally overlap with the content of the non-hypothetical statements.Scientific Objection: EfficacyAre we sure this works at all?A typical polygenic score is created by collecting thousands or millions of adult genomes, then matching genetic information with surveys about who has the trait/condition of interest. Reputable studies then test these scores on holdout samples - adults who were not used to make the score, to see if they still accurately predict who has the trait/condition. Polygenic embryo selection depends on an assumption that the scores which work in these kinds of retrospective tests will also work prospectively on embryos. This assumption hasn't been formally proven in studies (which would require years to decades to conduct), but seems common-sensical.The strongest challenge to the application of polygenic scores for embryo selection comes from a recent body of research showing that most scores combine causal genetic effects with population stratification, and therefore can be expected to lose much of their predictive power when comparing two members of the same family (e.g. two embryos from the same couple). There is increasing agreement in the field that unless scores are validated within families, headline results like \"decreases risk of X by Y%\" will be large overestimates. When I talked to company representatives, they all said that they took accuracy extremely seriously and had various white papers and journal articles where anyone could double-check their methodology. But I attended an industry conference a few months ago, and the gossip level was comparable to a high school cafeteria (minus the sex rumors - most of the attendees were having their own kids via IVF). Everyone had some story about someone being careless or fudging their numbers.Some of the conflicts broke out into the open on Wednesday, when Herasight left stealth and published a white paper and associated blog post. They criticize Genomic Prediction for reporting between-family rather than within family results9, and Orchid for smuggling a term for age into their Alzheimer's predictor (unsurprisingly, this makes it work better). We'll get to their accusations against Nucleus below. Note that this was recent enough that competitors haven't had time to respond or to air their own criticisms of Herasight; if this happens, I'll try to keep you updated.Maybe this is cope, but my optimistic perspective is that this bounds the damage. This obviously isn't a field capable of maintaining a conspiracy of silence. But aside from the Nucleus allegations, the complaints aren't existential. Maybe some numbers are too high, maybe some predictors are slightly rigged. But the more we learn about these admittedly concerning problems, the more we can hope that we'd have heard about it if nothing worked at all. Overall my strongest opinion on the scientific criticisms is:Authorities on all sides have cited Alex Young10 as an authority on how polygenic scores can be confounded or misleading.Last week Alex Young revealed that he had been working with Herasight while it was in stealth mode, and endorses their research.LOL.Probably that means Herasight's products are okay.That serves as proof-of-concept that this technology can work, and means other companies' claims are at least plausible.Scientific Objections: Antagonistic PleiotropyThis is a fancy term for \"sometimes genes that are good in one way are bad in other ways\". For example, there is a gene that decreases the risk of lung cancer, but increases the risk of leukemia. If you selected against lung cancer, you might give your child higher leukemia risk. Several of the professional societies raise this concern, and Sasha Gusev gives several examples here, including a correlation between education/IQ and anorexia.When I think about these concerns, I consider the following thought experiment: suppose that I had a natural, unselected child, and that child became high school valedictorian and got into Harvard. Would my first reaction be \"Oh no! This slightly raises her risk of anorexia!\"? If not, why should this be our reaction to artificially increasing IQ? Genetic selection isn't doing some different, magical thing. It's just picking from within the natural IQ/anorexia variation. If you would be happy to have higher IQ (or lower breast cancer risk, or lower schizophrenia risk) naturally, you should be happy to get it through selection too.(Objection one: suppose that the genetic component of IQ is net negative, but the environmental component is net positive to an even greater degree. Then IQ itself might be net positive - so you could still celebrate your valedictorian child - but since the genetic component alone is bad you wouldn't want to select for it. I have never heard anyone seriously claim this, most studies suggest that genetic components of good things are good in the expected ways, and most critics don't get this far. I mention it for the sake of completeness only.)(Objection two: is the example above just saying that I value IQ more than non-anorexia? If so, couldn't I give an alternate example of learning that my child isn't anorexic, celebrating this seemingly-obviously-good fact, but actually this means they have lower IQ and based on my stated values I should be sad? I don't think so. There is no claim that the increased anorexia risk from raising IQ is exactly as bad as the IQ increase is good - for example, you could imagine a world where going from moron to supergenius only raises anorexia risk 0.0001%. More generally - although not rigorously - selecting for X should usually increase X more than it increases tangentially-correlated construct Y. So selecting for IQ should be net positive, even though it might slightly increase anorexia risk, and selecting for anorexia should be net negative, even though it might slightly increase IQ. I think this is the intuition that drives parents to be happy both when they learn that their child is smart, and when they learn their child doesn't have anorexia - not just an intuition that one trait matters more than the other)But also, here's the table of correlated genetic risks for psychiatric disorders:...where blue means that lowering the risk of one disease also lowers the risk of the other, and red means the opposite (as in the IQ - anorexia example above).Here's the same table for other conditions, courtesy of Genomic Prediction (except I flipped the colors from the original, to match the one above):Aside from two bright orange squares (gallstones vs. hypertension and hypothyroidism - I don't know what's up with this and it doesn't seem to be a widely-appreciated result) we see that most correlations are zero or positive - that is, selecting against one disease selects against another or at worst does nothing. In this ocean of blue, worrying about those few orange squares feels a bit motivated.Hans Jonas-ism says that no medical intervention may ever cause any harm, no matter how much benefit it produces. By this standard, perhaps slightly raising the risk of gallstones in the process of preventing various cancers and psychoses and other forms of human misery is unacceptable. To anyone with the more normal perspective where something with large benefits and tiny downsides is still pretty good, I don't think the antagonistic pleiotropy argument carries much weight. Ethical Objection: CostNo way around this one: if these products work, they mean that rich people can have healthier/smarter/taller/prettier kids than poor people.One might object that at least they're in good company: other products which help rich kids get healthier/smarter/taller/prettier than poor kids include private tutors, gyms, hair salons, health insurance, clothing, books, and food. Is this really the time to declare ourselves against this kind of thing? But maybe we should fight against expanding this already-bloated category. Or maybe there's something more final about a genetic advantage.Maybe a stronger argument is that rich people get first crack at every new technology, but poor people usually follow close behind. The first cellphone, in 1982, cost $12,000 in today's dollars. Now you can get something a thousand times better for $50, and Kenyan pastoralists use cell phones to call up the local shaman. The trajectory of genetics has been even more striking: sequencing a single genome cost about $100 million in 2000 and is somewhere around $100 today.Polygenic embryo selection has the potential to follow a similar path. There are two associated costs - sequencing the embryos, and running the analysis. Sequencing costs are decreasing and may eventually be comparable to the sorts of genetic screening (for e.g. Down Syndrome) that most families get anyway. Analysis costs are mostly the one-time expense of inventing the predictor; we might expect these to follow the same pattern as generic medications, where cutting-edge technology is jealously guarded and expensive, but last decade's technology has made its way off patent and is cheap-to-free. A few groups have already created free open-source predictors; so far these are much worse than the private companies' versions, but one of last year's ACX Grantees is working on a better one.Also, it would be crazy for any forward-thinking government not to cover this; it could save hundreds of thousands of dollars in future health care expenses. In countries with public health care, this comes directly out of the government treasury; even in the US, it's covered by Medicare after age 65. The government should be begging people to select embryos.The most persistent cost barrier is likely to be in vitro fertilization itself, a necessary precursor. In the US, 2-3% of babies are born through IVF. For those kids, this is a no-brainer - even if the cost never comes down, the cheaper products are only a fraction of total IVF expense. What about the other 98%? If those parents feel like they have to get embryo selection (and therefore IVF) to keep up, this could be a significant burden. IVF isn't fun - it requires pumping a woman full of mind-altering hormones for weeks, extracting eggs in a minor surgery, and then implanting embryos in another minor surgery, all with a decent chance that some step will fail and you'll have to do it all again. It also costs $15,000 in the US (less in poorer countries), and unlike the genetics, the cost has barely gone down in the past twenty-five years.Some countries, including Israel, offer free IVF for anybody who wants it. And universal basic IVF is surprisingly popular even in the usually government-phobic United States - Donald Trump made it part of his campaign platform. So there's a plausible path to embryo selection for everyone who wants it.But it's still going to take a while, it will hit different people at different times, and so far11 there's no way around the month or two of various miserable medical procedures for women. Ethical Objection: PersonhoodIs it really correct to say that you have reduced someone's risk of breast cancer by 46%, if what you've really done is closer to replacing them with a different person who is 46% less likely to have breast cancer? I cover this one in more depth here.Ethical Objection: RaceThis one is awkward: right now the technology works best for white people.Most genetic data available for research/commercial use comes from the UK, US, and Europe - areas which are mostly white. Asian biobanks, and those serving US minority communities, have been more reluctant to share data. So we know a lot about the genetics of white people, and only a limited amount about the genetics of anyone else. Companies are suitably embarrassed about this, and researchers in the field are working hard to wring every ounce of information out of the minority data they have. But for now, white people are the clear winner.Here's data from Herasight:A European family with five embryos and no family history can cut their diabetes risk by 47%, and an African family 29%, with everyone else in between.As usual, all companies say that they adjust their scores based on the couple's genetic ancestry. As usual, Herasight challenges them to publicly release data on exactly how they performed the adjustments and how well they work. All companies say they are working as hard as they can to improve cross-ancestry portability, but that progress will remain limited until governments collect/release better genetic data on non-white populations.Ethical Objection: SelectionAt some point, you've got to choose.Genomic Prediction and Herasight offer scores that aggregate overall health risks. Some people will follow them slavishly. Other people will try to second-guess them - would you prefer your child have lower cancer risk, or less chance of heart attacks?And this is the best case scenario! Herasight offers predictors for IQ, height and BMI; Nucleus offers those plus eye color and hair color12. A parent might encounter a situation where the embryo with their favorite eye color also has the highest cancer and schizophrenia risk, and choose to doom their child to cancer and schizophrenia because they really want pretty eyes.On average, even if everyone in the world selected for eye color, it wouldn't raise cancer and schizophrenia risk. No not-deliberately-perverse polygenic selection choice can make your child worse off in expectation. Still, suppose you got cancer, and your mom admitted that she selected you for pretty eyes and didn't even check the cancer column of the embryo selection report. How would you feel?And would you feel better or worse than someone whose parents didn't do embryo selection at all, and spent the money on a Caribbean vacation? What if they selected your brother for everything great, then had you naturally? What if they selected you for IQ, but actually you are very stupid, and you were one of the 20% of cases where a predictor that's right 80% of the time gets it wrong? Mark my words, one day there will be entire subfields of therapy dedicated to these issues.Going NuclearEven as outsiders criticize the whole field, Herasight has launched a full-scale attack on competitor Nucleus.Herasight's white paper compares its own predictors (favorably) to those of Orchid and Genomic Prediction......but refuses to acknowledge Nucleus at all. In a supplementary note, the authors explain why: they accuse Nucleus of being so bad that it would \"not yield a reliable or meaningful addition to our analysis\". They say Nucleus has inflated the accuracy of their scores. This is most dramatic for a few conditions like ADHD, where the leading published polygenic score is based on 2,300,000 variants but explains only ~1% of variance in the condition. Nucleus' score is based on 12 variants13 and (implicitly) claims to explain 3-6%. This doesn't make sense. Some of Nucleus' other scores do use millions of variants. But many of these are 5-10 year old scores downloaded from open-source catalogs, whose accuracy statistics are easily available and far less than Nucleus claims. Here is what Herasight finds when they double-check Nucleus' numbers:On their Substack, Herasight also criticizes Nucleus' monogenic screening product. They point out cases where it fails to properly screen for the conditions it claims. For example, the Nucleus website advertises screening for spinal muscular atrophy:But on their gene list......they don't screen for SMN, which causes 95% of spinal muscular atrophy cases. They only screen for UBA1, which causes a distinct and much rarer condition called x-linked infantile spinal muscular atrophy. Professional organizations publish guidelines for what genes need to be screened in a screening product, and Nucleus does not appear to be following them.In further discussion, Herasight continued with exhaustive criticism of essentially everything Nucleus had ever done down to the smallest detail. Nucleus reports list the same baseline disease risk regardless of patient ancestry, but different ancestry groups should have different risks14. Nucleus' physician reports sometimes list lower-than-average risk for patients with positive polygenic scores15. Nucleus' age-based risk tables don't distinguish between age and cohort effects (is this bad? see footnote16). My favorite critique is that Nucleus wrote a blog post criticizing competing company Orchid......which included a section on how Orchid is a polygenic selection company, and polygenic selection companies are inherently \"sketchy\" and \"honestly should be illegal\". But Nucleus is also a polygenic selection company! This is like Marlboro attacking Camel on the grounds that cigarettes are addictive and should be banned! Obviously something went wrong here - my guess is AI - and it's a really bad look, especially when these scientific issues are so hard to litigate, and so many of us will have to go off gestalt impressions of corporate culture.Nucleus states that they validate their models internally and intend to make their results public soon.A Foothill Of The FutureIt's hard not to love this technology. Lots of people (and the aforementioned professional organizations) manage anyway, but it's hard.If this were a single-use medical treatment, delivered by a doctor after someone got the relevant condition, it would be one of the biggest advances of the decade - imagine a drug that cures 10 - 40%17 of breast cancers with no side effects! But in fact, it works for breast cancer, and schizophrenia, and heart attacks, and approximately everything else. The only things comparable are antibiotics and GLP-1RAs. And then there's the IQ effects. Even after studying the literature, people have wildly different opinions about the importance of IQ. One of the most important debates is to what degree IQ differences are a cause of poverty, a consequence of poverty, or both. I lean towards both - a country with limited access to schools and medical care will have low average IQ, but as a consequence it probably won't become the next big semiconductor hub. This technology could close half the IQ gap between poor and middle-income countries, or between middle-income and rich. Or it could give rich countries average IQs that have never been seen before, and let us see what kind of O-ring technologies (and new forms of social cooperation) lie just beyond the frontier. (this is the nice quantifiable argument in favor of IQ enhancement, but I find myself more convinced by fuzzier things - how much is it worth to be able to enjoy great art and literature? To fully comprehend what we know of nature, and be able to fully appreciate the mystery of the rest? To have a sense of why society works the way it does, instead of feeling like you're being blown back and forth by institutions you don't really understand? Amateur psychoanalysts like to say that the only people who care about IQ are those looking for an excuse to boast about how high their own is, but my experience is the opposite: I care about IQ because I bang up against the limits of my own a thousand times a day, and I hate it. I fantasize about ways to make my children smarter than I am for the same reason a dog confined in a tiny crate might fantasize about getting her puppies adopted out to a nice house with a big grassy yard.)My biggest qualm is that it might not matter. This is such a tiny foothill, flanking such a vast and foreboding range of mountains, that it might be a mistake to care about it at all.Selecting the best of five or ten embryos is not a very effective way to get the genes you want. There are things in the pipeline that will make this look like Hippocrates draining black bile. By the time the first polygenically selected children are adults, they'll be old news.And then there's AI. The average age at diagnosis for Type II diabetes is 45 years. Will there still be people growing gradually older and getting Type II diabetes and taking insulin injections in 2070? If not, what are we even doing here?Many people in the transhumanist community are still bullish on this technology. They think - well, there's still an outside chance that something comes up and AGI takes another few decades. If we can enhance humans to be smarter, healthier, and more determined by the time it arrives, maybe we'll have a better chance. Or maybe, if there's a positive optimistic vision of a human-based high-tech future, people will be more willing to delay AI in the first place.I like this argument, but I also think it's worth stepping back. What's the point of anything? Why have kids at all in a world that's changing this fast? Why save for the future? At some point your answer has to be romantic and aesthetic - it's never been clear whether anything you do matters in any ultimate sense, but you've got to act as if it does and hope for the best.From that perspective, this is the most romantic technology of all. You're not just giving a better life to your kids. Genes travel from generation to generation; you're giving a better life your grandkids, your great-grandkids and so on to the point 1.77*log₂(population) generations from now when you are the ancestor of everybody and nobody. Somebody in Macaronesia in 3525 AD will avoid getting breast cancer because of you (if there is still cancer; if there are still breasts).Some combination of reasonable cost-benefit analysis and romantic/aesthetic commitments makes me want to have children despite the uncertainty, and the same combination made me sign up to use this technology despite the same. More later on how that's going.1I'm slightly mixing up two different things here - Down Syndrome can be detected with an aneuploidy test, but cystic fibrosis takes a more involved PGT-M test.2There are two separate questions here. First, how much would diabetes risk decline if you selected the embryo with the lowest risk for diabetes - something you have no reason to do, since you have no reason to privilege diabetes risk over risk of any other disease? Second, how much would diabetes risk go down if you selected the embryo with the lowest health risk overall? Genomic Prediction's their risk calculator calculator shows, seemingly paradoxically, that you get -38% relative risk by selecting against diabetes alone, but -41% relative risk by selecting against everything at once. Over email, they stand by this surprising result, saying that \"for a couple of diseases (type II diabetes and CAD), the EHS actually accomplishes a larger risk reduction than the individual predictors. The explanation is that the EHS takes into account multiple PRS of diseases with high comorbidity\". See eg Figure 3 here:...and the section of the post called \"Antagonistic Pleiotropy\" for more. However, this paradoxical benefit is only true for a few conditions like diabetes - for everything else, selecting on health index does better than you would naively think, but still does not decrease the risk of a given condition as much as selecting against that condition directly.3That is, new mutations in that particular baby, as opposed to older mutations already present in the parents.4Conflicts of interest: I have used Orchid's and Herasight's products on my own embryos (not the ones used to conceive my existing kids, but for a potential third child), employees of Genomic Prediction and Herasight have been extremely helpful in contributing expertise to ACX posts on genetics, and I might invest in this field at some point (though haven't done so yet). This post started as Herasight asking me to write about their white paper, then spiraled out of control. There were some unexpected time pressures and the result is that I didn't get a chance to run everything in Herasight's white paper by their competitors as thoroughly as I would like. Although I talked to representatives of all four companies profiled here, I feel like this probably reflects Herasight's perspective better than other companies', and that this is a major flaw. If other companies have responses, I'll publish them. Thanks to all companies involved for their assistance on this article.Finally, I am favorably disposed toward Herasight because of how I learned about them: a professor named Jonathan Anomaly got cancelled from Penn for being too gung-ho about genetic enhancement, and used his newfound freedom to join a very-early-stage Herasight, raise their ambitions, and sell everyone (including me) on the idea. I grew up on a diet of books and movies about mad scientists, and I'm a sucker for a story about a guy named Doctor Anomaly pursuing revenge against the small-minded fools who destroyed his career by creating a race of superbabies. 5The version of the tool I looked at said 5.9 points for five embryos, up to 9 points for twenty embryos. The version of the tool on their current said says 5.3 - 9, so they might have recalculated after I finalized this article.6Used in quotation marks because these scores were fine for the predictive tasks they were applied for - they just weren't finding genes that directly caused the outcome of interest.7Conflict of interest notice: this table was originally unadjusted. A representative of Herasight claimed that this was unfair, because each company used slightly different reporting conventions, and offered to correct for this in a neutral way. I retraced their reasoning, confirmed that the correction did not especially benefit Herasight at the expense of other companies, and accepted the correction. The original unadjusted table is below:Herasight was insufficiently comfortable with Nucleus' methodology to even be willing to posit a corrected value, so I left their self-reported value in gray.8Zagorsky (2007) says an extra IQ point means $234-$616/year in higher salary. The midpoint of $425 equals $670 in today's dollars; assuming a forty-year career, Nucleus' +1 point estimate is worth $26,800 (vs. $9,249 Nucleus cost) and Herasight's +6 point estimate is worth $160,800 (vs. $53,250 Herasight cost).9As part of researching this article, I asked all four major companies about their within-family validation strategies. Here are some details:Genomic Prediction discusses their strategy in this paper. The results are complicated to interpret - the within-family numbers often have such wide error bars that they overlap with both the across-family numbers and with zero - but looking qualitatively it seems like most scores on average lose about 25% of their risk reduction ability (though averages might not be the right way to do this, and some might be much more affected than others). Their website reports unadjusted, not within-family validated numbers; GP says they say this clearly on their site (which is true), Herasight counters that they still present their numbers as applicable to embryo selection (which is also true). To get the most applicable-to-embryo-selection numbers, you might want to adjust GP's stated numbers down somewhat; it's hard to say exactly how much, but maybe 20 - 25%?Herasight has their within-family validation results in their white paper. They say there is no significant decrease in accuracy for 16 of their 17 disease risk predictors; the last, osteoporosis, has a minor decrease. They intend to publish more on their trait predictors soon.Orchid say they validate within-family whenever possible, although certain conditions are too rare to do so properly. They present within-family results for seven of their scores here; none show any significant decrease in accuracy.Before I got to this question, Nucleus asked me not to send them further questions. But their website says:» \"Research shows that polygenic scores for diseases are less likely to be impacted by factors that could confound predictions, like assortative mating, where people tend to marry those with similar characteristics (13). Furthermore, research shows that the heritability of these phenotypes don't change across relatives and people who are unrelated, indicating true direct genetic effects (14). Recent research also shows, compared to behavioral genetics phenotypes like IQ, clinical phenotypes like migraines have negligible indirect effects (15).\"This is not how other experts I talked to described the state of the research, but it suggests Nucleus doesn't see a need to within-family-validate their scores.10See Missing Heritability: Much More Than You Wanted To Know for more on Young's research.11One typical way to quantify whether health interventions are worth it is through DALYs (and the very similar QALYs). US health economists usually support interventions that cost less $100,000 per QALY gained. Herasight claims a gain of 1-4 QALYs; taking my 1.66 example, that's a $53,250 cost for a $166,000 gain. But there are several reasons not to take this at face value. First, so far the government isn't paying - you are - and you may value money differently than the government does (for example, if you have less than $100,000, you will not spend $100,000 for any number of QALYs; if you're a billionaire, you might happily spend tens of millions on a single QALY). Second, if you apply a time discount, the intervention probably goes back below the $100,000 per DALY threshold again.12Herasight says they are skeptical that Nucleus' hair and eye color predictors work, partly based on their overall skepticism of Nucleus' product, and partly because hair and eye color predictors have proven unexpectedly hard and Nucleus does not have the resources that it would take to solve this difficult problem.13Nucleus says they use 7,000 variants from 13 genes, but Herasight says they use 12 variants total. It looks like the discrepancy comes from Nucleus using two different tests for ADHD - a monogenic screen which looks for 7,000 different pathogenic variations in 13 relevant genes, and a polygenic score which includes 12 variants. The monogenic screen is not really related to the kind of polygenic scores we're talking about here, and the 12-variant polygenic score is more comparable to the scores offered by other companies.14Most of these complaints are based on Nucleus' adult results, which they have been offering longer than the embryo selection results and which Herasight had an easier time getting copies of. Their concerns are based on an assumption that Nucleus' embryo selection technology is based on its adult genomic technology.15Positive polygenic scores usually mean higher-than-average risk. I asked Nucleus about this, and they said they are using it to mean higher risk than the midpoint of cases and controls. The geneticist I asked about this said this is a possible way to do things, but non-standard and potentially confusing. I wasn't able to consult enough outsiders to have a strong opinion either way.16An age effect is when a disease is genuinely more common in someone of a certain age - for example, Alzheimers is more common in elderly people. A cohort effect is when a disease is more common in people of a certain generation, sometimes because of diagnostic changes - for example, ADHD diagnoses are more common in people born in the 1990s, since schools started screening for it in the 1990s. Nucleus' adult report on ADHD looks like this:...so it's reporting a combination of both types of effect. If I imagine myself as a patient, I am fine with this - it is true that I, as a man between 18 and 44, am 4.5% likely to have an ADHD diagnosis (when my genes are taken into account). But if you were expecting this to tell you the true frequency of ADHD with age, you would get confused. It would be much more irresponsible to present information this way with embryo selection (because it's not true that an embryo born nine months from now will have 1.1% chance of an ADHD diagnosis at age 45, since they're in a generation with a higher ADHD diagnosis rate), but Nucleus doesn't seem to be doing this.1710% if you're selecting against everything equally; up to 46% if you're selecting against breast cancer in particular. The 10% number is probably closer to how most people will use it, but the 46% number might be more suitable for this specific analogy where it's being used as a cure.",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I've had a bit of success on this site, hitting 900 followers in less than a month. Presumably follower growth is exponential, meaning that in just a few months every human on Earth will be reading my posts. I do not want to be alone in my success, and therefore, I'll share some tips on how I got to this point. 1. Write posts about how to be a successful Substack authorThis one goes without saying. You goal is for everyone on Substack to subscribe to you. You want to write about cars? The car people will subscribe. You want to write about politics? The political animals will subscribe. You want to write about philosophy? The philosophers will subscribe. You want everyone into Substack to smash that subscribe button? Then write about Substack. Some of the most successful authors on this site do nothing but write about how to be good at writing on Substack. Even their notes get thousands of likes. Just as, for Aristotle, God is nothing but pure thought thinking about pure thought itself, so your goal is to be a pure Substack writer writing on nothing other than pure Substack writing. I know what you're thinking: \"But if my Substack is not successful yet, then how will I be knowledgeable enough to write about how to be a successful Substack author?\" This is the classic Socratic dilemma: how can we discern what virtue is, if we have to already know virtue in order to identify it? You forget that you already know the answer to this question, since I just told you the right answer. The way to get successful on Substack is by writing about how to get successful on Substack. What do you write? Well, now you know how to be successful on Substack, so write on that. 2. Write correct thingsYou don't even need to read further, since you now know how to create the ideal Substack. But in the off-chance that you ever have the erroneous desire to write about something other than how to be successful on Substack, you will need to do things other than tell people to write about how to be successful on Substack. You will also need to learn other truths to post. People do not want to read incorrect things. If you say incorrect things, people will comment, \"That is incorrect,\" and then not subscribe. They will post the same thing regardless, but if you post correct things, then such commenters will only be the ones too stupid to discern correct from incorrect, and so they will not know that (conditional on your being wrong) it would be incorrect to share your posts and subscribe to you. This phenomenon alone got me about 200 followers from one post. Therefore, you get the most subscribers by writing correct things instead of incorrect things. Some examples of correct claims are: (i) Everyone capable is morally obligated to be a vegan; (ii) weakness of will is not real; (iii) no principle ineliminably justified by intuition has moral authority; (iv) you can be a successful Substack author by writing about how to be a successful Substack author; and (v) Bayesianism is correct about empirical knowledge. Make posts arguing for propositions such as these, and empirically, your following will grow. 3. Have correct beliefsIn order to write correct things, you have to have correct beliefs, so that you can write them. You may think there are other methods to achieve this end; for example, you could have only false beliefs, and then write the opposite of what you believe. There are three problems with this strategy. First, having only false beliefs is just as hard as having true beliefs, since you'd have to find the correct thing to believe and then believe the opposite. Second, when you start writing a post and intend to write the opposite of what you believe, you will have a false belief about what you believe, causing you to write what you believe, which, we assume, is false. Third, false beliefs can contradict each other, meaning any proposition p follows from them. You will therefore believe that p does not follow from your beliefs, and so you will write a post saying that p does follow from your beliefs, which would give people the impression that you believe p. But p was arbitrary, so p could be false, meaning you just got dangerously close to writing something incorrect. When I look at my account and contrast with those with fewer followers, the common denominator is that the others do not have correct beliefs. 4. Write about things that are worth people's moneyIt is not sufficient to have correct beliefs in order to write correct things. Were this sufficient, then you could become a successful by repeatedly typing \"2 + 2 = 4\" and posting it. You cannot become successful by doing this, and therefore writing correct things is not sufficient. One thing that is worthwhile to people is money, and therefore a good heuristic would be to post things that are worth people's money. There are two ways for something to be worth someone's money. First, it might be worth some amount of money greater than what they might sacrifice. Second, it might be worth more than an arbitrary amount of money.The only thing that is worth more than an arbitrary amount of money is a good will. Now, you cannot sell someone a good will, but what you can do is give them writings to help them achieve one. Thus, if you want to write something worth people's money, a safe bet is to write about ethics. Remember, of course, that you also need to be correct about ethics. Since moral beliefs are conclusions of practical reason, the only way to have correct beliefs about ethics is by being a virtuous person. Therefore, if you ever sin, you seriously damage any possibility of being a successful Substack author. Some examples of ethical truths are: (i) utilitarianism is false; (ii) you should be vegan; (iii) anyone can be morally perfect whenever they want; (iv) eating flesh is immensely more immoral than voting for Biden or Trump; and (v) saying anything but what is correct and relevant, barring extreme circumstances, is manipulation and therefore immoral. The other, less safe way to make your posts worth people's money is by making them merely worth more than some amount of money. Therefore, you might write about how to sell cars, because selling cars well gives direct financial benefits. Or you may give advice about relationships, since many people value good relationships more than even considerable amounts of money. But remember the previous advice; you do not merely want car salesmen or those who forego their autonomy to enter romantic relationships to follow you. You should, therefore, write about what is universally applicable. Most generally, that would be how to be a successful Substack author, but if you want to go beyond that, you should write about ethics, since everybody has to correctly conclude practical deliberation and thereby act.5. Don't make people pay for your postsEven though your posts will be worth people's money, do not charge people money for them. First, that will cause you to have fewer followers, and arbitrarily limit the number of people exposed to important truths about ethics and about how to be a successful Substack author. Second, it is immoral. This post is not about how to become a rich Substack author, but rather a successful one. The word \"successful,\" if used without qualification, refers to achievement of the highest good, which is perfect virtue and happiness in accordance with virtue. Therefore, you need to be virtuous, which means not charging people money to read the truths you have to express. Such would be contrary to the exercise of your duty to beneficence and to not hinder the perfection of others. Moreover, if you make people pay for your posts, then they will think of your writing as commensurable with mere money, causing them to poorly understand the correct things that you post. This will mean your post will have been as if it contained incorrect things, causing the disadvantages described above. The above is nothing more than what have I have done; follow the above advice, and I cannot think of any reason why you will not be as successful as me. May you have perfect virtue and happiness in accordance with virtue.",

      "content": "Hello everyone! Thanks for your patience with my quiet here while I was away trying to get some focused time working on my book. I hope you've had a wonderful summers so far; I have, though it has sped by. My retreat in Paris has me thinking today less about specific craft issues and more about what makes writing possible—about the structures in a life that allow you to produce the rough (or wonderfully hewn!) first draft from which you can shape what comes next. What is the scaffolding in your life that allows you to write, when so much in the world requires your attention? And how do you celebrate the small accomplishments, the ordinary virtues, of a work day that is far from perfect?Meghan O'Rourke's Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.Many of us imagine writing as deriving either from a bolt of inspiration or a consistent application of iron discipline. I don't know about you, but any time I hear about someone writing a book in a three-week sprint (I'm looking at you, Jack Kerouac; more recently, I believe the French writer Colombe Shneck wrote one section of Swimming in Paris in a few short weeks or months) I feel overcome. Why doesn't that happen to me? I wonder. Why am I so slow? At the other end of the spectrum, we romanticize writers like Anthony Trollope—who wrote a set number of words a day—or Philip Roth, who was famously routine in his writing. In MFA programs, many of us teach the importance of consistency. But most of what I've written that matters—books, essays, poems—has emerged not from flashes of genius or perfect consistency but from uneven repetition, a kind of patient (but not punitive) accountability with myself, and the gentle pressure of rituals that are inevitably disrupted by illness, family crisis, or child-rearing—and, crucially, which help me to rebound from those interruptions.Some of this has to do with where I focus my energy. I tend to be perfectionistic, and it's easy for me to focus only on what is not working. As time passes, and the books get written, though, I've come to see that creating a life that invites your writing to return to central stage *even when your attention strays* is itself the key task. What environments allow you to keep coming back to writing even when time and energy are fractured? For you, that environment might be physical (a desk you enjoy returning to; a sunny room that feels like a retreat), social (a group that expects your pages), or temporal (an hour each morning when the house is quiet, or that you look forward to returning to after camping with your family for ten days). But it is almost always built, not found—and, crucially, part of what we have to create is a tolerance for our own lapses. We have to focus on the small happenings unfurling all the time...and make room for them. How to get back to the desk that is always waiting? Dorka Kardos-Latif on UnsplashThis summer, for me, the usual scaffolding is under stress now that I'm back from Paris. The momentum I had got interrupted by a three‑day migraine, jet lag, and an overdue colonoscopy. (My mother died at 55 from colon cancer and I swore to her I'd be good about getting screened. You should too!) The kids are home. Camps change weekly. There are birthdays and trips to Legoland to plan. Some days I sit down to write only to realize it's already time to pack snacks and head to the pool...So let's talk about concrete practices to allow for consistent overcoming of inconsistency, which I think is an often overlooked aspect of a writing life. Here are the three key elements I rely on, followed by a checklist that I find helpful, and hope you will too.Meghan O'Rourke's Substack is a reader-supported publication.

      "content": "It must be encoded there, in the childhood memories of our synapses and our cells — how we came out of the ocean 35 trillion yesterdays ago, small and slippery, gills trembling with the shock of air, fins budding feet, limbs growing sinewy and furred, then unfurred, spine unfurling beneath the bone cave housing three pounds of pink flesh laced with one hundred trillion synapses that still sing with pleasure and awe when touched by the wildness of the world. Even as the merchants of silicon and code try to render us disembodied intellects caged behind screens, something in our animal body knows where we came from and where we belong. Gibbons from from Natural History and Illustrations of Mammals by Heinrich Rudolf Schinz, 1824. (Available as a print and a greeting card.) \"Our origins are of the earth,\" Rachel Carson wrote. \"And so there is in us a deeply seated response to the natural universe, which is part of our humanity.\" A century before her, William Henry Hudson (August 4, 1841&ndash;August 18, 1922) — another of humanity's great writers devoted to rewilding the human spirit — captured the essence of what science now calls \"soft fascination\": the way our brains and bodies respond when we immerse ourselves in the natural world. In a passage from his altogether wonderful 1893 book Idle Days in Patagonia (public domain), Hudson writes: What has truly entered our soul and become psychical is our environment — that wild nature in which and to which we were born at an inconceivably remote period, and which made us what we are. It is true that we are eminently adaptive, that we have created, and exist in some sort of harmony with new conditions, widely different from those to which we were originally adapted; but the old harmony was infinitely more perfect than the new, and if there be such a thing as historical memory in us, it is not strange that the sweetest moment in any life, pleasant or dreary, should be when Nature draws near to it, and, taking up her neglected instrument, plays a fragment of some ancient melody, long unheard on the earth... Nature has at times this peculiar effect on us, restoring instantaneously the old vanished harmony between organism and environment. Art by Margaret C. Cook for Leaves of Grass. (Available as a print.) At the end of his life, looking back on how becoming \"a better observer\" made him \"a happier creature,\" Hudson writes in his wonderful Book of a Naturalist (public domain): The power, beauty, and grace of the wild creature, its perfect harmony in nature, the exquisite correspondence between organism, form and faculties, and the environment, with the plasticity and intelligence for the readjustment of the vital machinery, daily, hourly, momentarily, to meet all changes in the conditions, all contingencies; and thus, amidst perpetual mutations and conflict with hostile and destructive forces, to perpetuate a form, a type, a species for thousands and millions of years! ... [One feels] the wonderfulness and eternal mystery of life itself; this formative, informing energy — this flame that burns in and shines through the case, the habit, which in lighting another dies, and albeit dying yet endures for ever; and the sense, too, that this flame of life was one, and of my kinship with it in all its appearances, in all organic shapes, however different from the human... the roe-deer, the leopard and wild horse, the swallow cleaving the air, the butterfly toying with a flower, and the dragon-fly dreaming on the river; the monster whale, the silver flying-fish, and the nautilus with rose and purple tinted sails spread to the wind. Tuning into this primal resonance between us and the rest of nature is the mightiest act of unselfing I know — a vital quieting of our ruminative self-reference that is the dynamo of most of our suffering. Perhaps to be a happier creature means simply to be more of a creature — a life-form among life-forms, alive only because countless other creatures died along the way to perfect this form in a world that didn't have to be beautiful, didn't even have to exist. donating = lovingFor seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the outgrown name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

Object permanence: Apple and trusted computing; TSA mocks travelers; Self-bricking med-tech. Upcoming appearances: Where to find me. Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. You can't fight enshittification (permalink) I need to tell you something unsatisfying: your personal consumption choices will not make a meaningful difference to the amount of enshittification you experience in your life. Oh sure, you can tinker in the margins, and you should! Get a repairable laptop, like the Framework, which is the greatest computer I've ever owned, and run Linux on it (I use Ubuntu, which is easy to install). You'll spend two weeks looking around the UI for the thing you need to click on and then you'll stop noticing it altogether, forever: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/13/graceful-failure/#frame Access the internet via RSS, and avoid all the algorithmic twiddling and surveillance that subjects you and yours to the depredations of the worst people on earth and their feral algorithms: https://www.citationneeded.news/curate-with-rss/ Give preference to high-security, private, open messaging tools like Signal. Open an account on a federated social media service, like Mastodon, and make it a first-class home for your online social life: https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/14/fire-exits/#graceful-failure-modes Do all this! Do more! You'll make your life somewhat better, and in some cases, much better. But you're not going to fight enshittification this way. Enshittification is not the result of people making bad choices: it's the result of bad policies that produce bad systems. Enshittification makes for a neat descriptive account, talking about how platforms go bad: Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys But the most important part of enshittification is its causal hypothesis: the answer it proposes to why this degradation is happening everywhere, right now: https://pluralistic.net/2025/02/26/ursula-franklin/#franklinite Here's why you're getting enshittified: we deliberately decided to stop enforcing competition laws. As a result, companies formed monopolies and cartels. This means that they don't have to worry about losing your business or labor to a competitor, because they don't compete. It also means that they can handily capture their regulators, because they can easily agree on a set of policy priorities and use the billions they've amassed by not competing to capture their regulators. They can hold a whip hand over their formerly powerful tech workers, mass-firing them and terrorizing them out of any Tron-inspired conceits about \"fighting for the user.\" Finally, they can use IP law to shut down anyone who makes technology that disenshittifies their offerings. You can take care to avoid enshittification, you can even make a fetish out of it, but without addressing these systemic failings, your individual actions will only get you so far. Sure, use privacy-enhancing tools like Signal to communicate with other people, but if the only way to get your kid to their little league game is to join the carpool group on Facebook, you're going to hemorrhage data about everything you do to Meta. Likewise, you can use privacy-preserving adblockers in your browser, but the instant you've got to do business with a monopoly that requires you to use their app, you will be totally helpless before them, because anti-circumvention law felonizes modifying an app so it preserves your privacy. An app is just a webpage skinned with the right kind of IP law to make it a jailable offense to install an ad-blocker: https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/07/treacherous-computing/#rewilding-the-internet When all your friends are going to a festival, are you really going to opt out because the event requires you to use the Ticketmaster app (because Ticketmaster has a monopoly over event ticketing)? If so, you're not gonna have a lot of friends, which is a pretty shitty way to live. If you turn your personal campaign to live an enshittification-free life into a set of rigid practices that isolate you from your community, you will be miserable – and you will undermine your ability to address the systemic roots of enshittification. That's because systemic problems have systemic solutions. They are addressed through mass movements, impact litigation, political action, street uprisings, mutual aid, and other forms of solidarity and community. The monsters who benefit from the status quo don't want you to know this. They want to brainwash you with Margaret Thatcher's mantra, \"There is no such thing as society.\" They want you to think that you are a pathetic, atomized individual. They want you to die in a heatwave while gasping out your profound regret for not recycling more diligently and taking more care with your \"carbon footprint.\" They want you to drive around for hours looking for an independent cardboard seller to make your protest sign with, convinced that it's more important to avoid shopping on Amazon than it is to actually show up at the protest outside the Amazon warehouse. They want you to curse yourself for failing to cycle and take the bus in your city where there are no bike lanes and the buses run every 45 minutes and stop at 8PM. If you wanted a livable city, you should have made better consumption choices! Perhaps you could dig your own subway, ever think of that, hmmm? You, me and everyone we know have all been subjected to a 40-year blitz of anti-solidaristic propaganda, aimed at convincing us that we are only allowed to fight the system as individuals. Don't like your health care? Shop around! Don't like your boss? Quit your job! Under no circumstances should you advocate for either a union or socialized health-care. You're an individual, there is no such thing as society. \"There's no such thing as society\" is what you say if you benefit from society (which absolutely exists) and don't want it to change. To make changes, you have to exist in society. Yes, the Democratic Party is a weak and pathetic failed gerontocracy, but the Democratic Socialists, the Sunrise Movement, and other political groups that are independent of the Dems but still drag them into doing something good, sometimes, all deserve your support. Yes, the union movement squandered the Biden years, refusing to spend its record-setting cash reserves on organizing, despite the millions of workers begging to join unions. But workplace democracy remains the only way that we ever have defeated capital (or ever will), so join a union, form a union, support a union: https://pluralistic.net/2025/01/29/which-side-are-you-on-2/#strike-three-yer-out Yes, plastic recycling is a scam cooked up by the petrochemical industry and all the plastic you stick in your blue bin either goes to an incinerator or a landfill, but if you don't support (and join up with) real environmental activists, you're going to roast alive: https://heated.world/cp/169762317 Yes, Israel is committing a genocide and Brown, Columbia, and other elite universities are capitulating to Trump, whose evangelical base believes that war in Israel will hasten the Second Coming, when all Jews will be cast into eternal damnation. But that doesn't relieve you of your responsibility to act to defend our Palestinian brothers and sisters from the death rained down on them with the weapons our governments send to Israel. That goes double for us Jews, in whose name the slaughter is being committed: https://www.thecanary.co/trending/2025/07/31/miriam-margolyes-hitler-comments/ My book on Enshittification is coming out in a couple of months, and the early reviews are already coming in, and they are gratifyingly glowing. But there's a trend in these reviews, a caveat that reviewer after reviewer has raised: my book is \"short on individual solutions.\" You're goddamned right it is. Because this isn't an individual problem, it's a systemic one. Sure, live the best life you can, making the best choices you can. But don't kid yourself that this is fighting enshittification. The reason corporations spy on you isn't because you're too cheap to pay for media, so they must resort to surveillance advertising. Whether or not you pay a tech company, they will absolutely spy on you: https://pluralistic.net/2022/11/14/luxury-surveillance/#liar-liar The reason they can spy on you is that the US hasn't had a new consumer privacy law since 1988, when the Video Privacy Protection Act banned video store clerks from disclosing which VHS cassettes you took home. This is the last technological threat to our privacy that Congress has addressed. The reason you are spied upon is because there are no systemic consequences for this surveillance: https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/06/privacy-first/#but-not-just-privacy The reason gig work companies misclassify their workers as contractors in order to abuse them, steal their wages, and deny them workplace protections is because they can – not because workers are insufficiently choosy about their employment arrangements. To fight systemic problems you need to be part of a systemic solution. For 23 and a half years, I've worked for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the most enshittification-fighting organization in the world: https://eff.org EFF is a member-supported nonprofit. We rely on donors like you, and we squeeze our budget hard. For as long as I've been with EFF, I've heard smears about how we're secretly shills for Big Tech and dependent on them for our funding (hilariously I once heard that EFF's reps to a meeting were transported to it in a stretch limo paid for by Intel – except I was the rep at that meeting, and I took the bus). Here's all of our financial disclosures, see for yourself: https://www.eff.org/about/annual-reports-and-financials Donating to EFF is one way to fund the systemic rejection of enshittification. But if you want to join the fight – if you want to be part of a community that fights back – then you need to know about the Electronic Frontier Alliance (EFA): https://efa.eff.org/allies EFA is a network of independent community groups that EFF helps coordinate and advise. When one group is in trouble, we connect it with other groups that have overcome the same troubles. When one group scores a victory, help other groups replicate its successes in their towns. Our organizers also help people in communities that don't have EFA affiliates start groups and join the network. I get it: this is harder work than changing your consumption habits. But it's infinitely more rewarding. You're more than a consumer. You can aspire to more dignity than is afforded to an ambulatory wallet: https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/16/through-the-meat-grinder/#hells-kitchen No one is coming to save us except us. There is such a thing as society, and you're a part of it, and so am I, and so are the rest of us: https://www.hamiltonnolan.com/p/they-are-going-to-take-everything You can't fight enshittification. But together, we can.

Stay ahead in semiconductors.Here are the answers to Semi Pub Quiz #1. If you want to attempt the quiz before looking at the answers, here's the original post.#1Dennard scaling enabled more transistors on a chip as gate length got smaller, but without increasing power density. But one parameter — fundamentally limited by thermal physics — refused to scale, setting a hard stop around 2005. Robert Dennard warned about this in his original paper, and how it would eventually spell the death of Dennard scaling. What is this parameter?A. Sub-threshold Slope or Gate LeakageSub-threshold slope (SS) quantifies how effectively a MOSFET transitions from off to on in the subthreshold region. Ideal SS is 60 mV/decade at 300 K.Robert Dennard and his co-authors noted that subthreshold slope does not scale even if more transistors can be crammed into a chip while keeping power density constant. The increasing gate leakage right around when gate lengths reached 90 nm in 2005, spelled the end of Dennard Scaling. If you answered gate leakage, that's fine too.#2According to its founder, Lee Byung-Chul, the name of this company means 'three stars' and began as a trading company in 1938. Since the 90s, it has evolved into a powerhouse with stakes in semiconductors, consumer electronics, insurance, and even food processing. It recently struck a massive deal involving $16.5B with Tesla. What company am I talking about?A: SamsungIn July 2025, Samsung won a $16.5B contract to manufacture Tesla's AI6 chips using 2 nm GAA (gate-all-around) transistors at its Texas fab. This massive foundry deal signals growing trust in its advanced-node readiness. While TSMC still leads in volume and yield, this contract represents a shift in competitive dynamics at the bleeding edge.From Bloomberg: Samsung to Make Tesla AI Chips in Multiyear Texas Deal#3Used for growing single-crystal silicon, this method sounds almost like a ballet; slow pulling, precise rotation, and heat control are key. But beneath the elegance lies a flaw: if too much oxygen sneaks in, minority carrier lifetimes are degraded. What is this method called?A: Czochralski ProcessThe Czochralski (CZ) method pulls a rotating seed crystal from molten silicon to grow large-diameter monocrystalline ingots. Crystal purity, defect density, and dopant uniformity are tightly controlled by atmosphere, temperature gradients, and rotation rates. It's the dominant method for producing wafers used in both IC and photovoltaic industries.See the Asianometry video on The Amazing Silicon Wafer. I also talk about this method in the article below.#4As gigawatt-class datacenters push towards higher DC voltages to boost efficiency, they flirt with a deadly risk: a breakdown of insulation that doesn't just short — it detonates. We're talking temperatures of 20,000°C — three times the sun's surface temperature, vaporizing metal and unleashing explosive force. What's the name of this catastrophic failure mode?A: Arc FlashAn arc flash is a sudden, high-temperature electrical explosion caused by air ionization between conductors. It can reach temperatures of 20,000 °C, posing lethal risks. Causes include insulation failure, equipment damage, or human error. Mitigation involves proper labeling, PPE, arc-rated gear, and compliance with NFPA 70E standards.From Wikipedia: Arc Flash. We also discussed this earlier in the context of high voltage DC architectures for GW-class datacenters. #5A new hyperscale datacenter project takes its name from a mythological figure who once defied the gods to deliver fire to humanity. What is this project called? Which company is building it?A: PrometheusMeta's Prometheus campus in Ohio is a hyperscale AI data center designed to support large foundation models. It features high-density GPU clusters, liquid cooling, and a modular architecture to enable rapid deployment. It supports Meta's push for 600,000+ GPUs across its \"AI supercluster\" network.Read SemiAnalysis' Meta Superintelligence – Leadership Compute, Talent, and Data.#6Which company, with the slogan \"Eat Well, Live Well\" originally known for its food additive business, became a critical supplier of films that were built on top of FR4 or glass core substrates and is a key material for advanced packaging of chips?A: AjinomotoDerived from by-products of umami seasoning products and perfected in just four months, Ajinomoto Build-up Film (ABF) is a high-performance dielectric substrate used in advanced IC packaging for signal routing and insulation. It supports multilayer redistribution layers (RDLs), fine-line wiring, and low loss at high frequencies. ABF is essential for HPC, AI chips, and advanced 2.5D/3D packaging.See Ajinomoto's rather unconnected product offerings, read about ABF, and check out their interesting innovation story.If you want to understand more about advanced packaging using ABF, see the post below. #7This type of Radar modulates the emitted signal frequency over time and uses the resulting beat frequency to extract both range and velocity simultaneously and is useful for automotive applications. What's the name of this technique?A: FMCW (Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave)FMCW radar transmits a continuously modulated frequency sweep. Mixing the received echo with the transmit signal yields a beat frequency proportional to distance, while Doppler shift reveals velocity. It enables fine resolution and low-power operation in automotive radar, presence detection, and mmWave sensors.

Their job is to shape the light field near edges, help resolve small features, and improve critical dimension. What are they called?A: Sub-Resolution Assist Features (SRAFs)SRAFs are non-printing optical features added near patterns to enhance lithography fidelity. They adjust the diffraction environment to improve critical dimension control. As patterning pushes below 10 nm, ML-assisted SRAF placement is becoming essential in OPC toolchains to minimize process variability. Read more about SRAFs here.#9Silicon is pretty great at a lot of things — even thinking — as we've recently seen with AI. Its greatest weakness is that it cannot produce light, while materials like Gallium Arsenide can. What is the property of silicon called that makes it its Achilles heel when it comes to producing light?A: Indirect bandgapSilicon's indirect bandgap prevents it from being an effective laser because the momentum of electrons and holes don't align, requiring a third particle—a phonon (lattice vibration)—to conserve momentum during recombination. This interaction makes the emission of a photon (light) a far less probable and efficient event compared to direct bandgap materials, where electrons and holes can recombine directly and emit light. Consequently, most of the energy in silicon is released as heat rather than light, making it unsuitable for the efficient light generation required for laser operation.

The latter is short for self-aligned silicide)Silicidation is a process in semiconductor manufacturing where a metal layer reacts with silicon to form a metal silicide. In MOS transistors, the polysilicon used in the gate often has a high resistance which translates to increased thermal noise. To minimize this contribution in circuits where noise matters, like in Low-Noise Amplifiers (LNAs), the polysilicon is silicided to reduce its resistance and its contribution to noise.

These markings tend to be shallow and non-pigmented, so they can be tough to glimpse and record. But recent innovations in photogrammetry—using software to piece together images into three-dimensional models—have enabled scientists to view these grooves in unprecedented detail.The finger figures found in the Waribruk cave were made possible by the cave’s dough-like walls. As water seeped into the limestone over millions of years, it forged tunnels and left the walls soft and pliable. Bacteria living on some of the moist surfaces create microcrystals, giving them their glittery appearance.SPECIAL SPARKLES: These microcrystals, created by bacteria on the cave’s walls, hold an important meaning in GunaiKurnai culture.

All in all, 950 sets of finger grooves were found on or near glitter-covered walls deep in the cave, as noted by a team of international researchers led by the GunaiKurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation. They estimated the age of these impressions—between 8,400 and 1,800 years—thanks to tiny bits of charcoal and ash, findings recently reported in the journal Australian Archaeology. The charcoal and ash may be remnants left by firesticks used to guide people through the cave.The positioning of some marks on a low ceiling in the cave suggests that people reached from a ledge while in all sorts of postures—crawling, sitting, and standing. In another spot, a set of markings appears to have been formed by a child, though the cave wall would have been beyond their reach. An adult might have held them up to touch the luminescent surface, according to the researchers.But why are these prints confined to the glittery walls? The answer lies in GunaiKurnai knowledge: Caves are known to the community as “spirit-places” and were solely visited by mulla-mullung, medicine men and women who incorporated powdered minerals and crystals into their work. The mulla-mullung must have dragged their fingers along these glittering walls, the authors speculate, to connect with the power of the crystals, which is associated with the life force of the ancestors.“Through these finger trails, we glimpse not only a physical act, but a cultural practice grounded in knowledge, memory, and spirituality,” the paper’s authors write for The Conversation. “A momentary movement, preserved in stone, connecting us to lives lived long ago.” ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Bradford DeLong: Lecture Notes: Adam Smith: 1. Smith's Human NatureAdam Smith starts with the observation that humans are largely but not exclusively self-interested creatures: we are, largely but not exclusively greedy. Yet we have a complex and sophisticated societal division of labor. And that division of labor is essential to our prosperity. Indeed, it is essential to our survival: drop one of us into the Sierra Nevada, even in summer—or even in our environment of evolutionary adaptation in the Horn of Africa—and we will quite likely die. Drop 100 of us, and we will quite likely survive, and even flourish. How can animals that are by nature greedy nevertheless cooperate on a large scale? That is the deep moral-philosophical question that we can see both of Smith's big books—his Theory of the Moral Sentiments and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations—as aimed at. As Robert Heilbroner puts it in his The Worldly Philosophers, Smith: is interested in laying bare the mechanism by which society hangs together. How is it possible for a community in which everyone is busily following his self-interest not to fly apart from sheer centrifugal force? What is it which guides each individual's private business so that it conforms to the needs of the group? With no central planning authority and no steadying influence of age old tradition, how does society manage to get those tasks done which are necessary for survival?...Adam Smith says that our ability to create and maintain a complicated societal division of labor that is so productive rests on four facets of human nature:language: in that we are an anthology intelligence—what one of us knows or learns, pretty quickly all of us within and many of us without earshot will quickly learn;hierarchy: in that we tend to form and respect dominance hierarchies in which we can command and obey;gift exchange: in that we bind ourselves together by forming gift-exchange relationships—what Adam Smith called our \"natural propensity to truck and barter\": we firmly expect to be and are very happy when we trade favors with each other, and we are uneasy when we feel as though we are always giving or always receiving, for we want the exchange of gifts and favors to be reciprocal, and roughly balanced.benevolence: in that our weak sense of fellow-feeling and empathy can be trained up to be quite strong and govern our decisions in gives us a powerful bias toward choosing win-win arrangements.The Wealth of Nations, of course, is about (3). But that does not mean that (1), (2), and (4) are secondary in the mind of Adam Smith the moral philosopher. (1), (2), and (4) become secondary only when we read Adam Smith as he would not have and his peers would not have. (1), (2), and (4) become secondary only when we read Adam Smith as an economist.But the Wealth of Nations is about (3). And there is enough in (3) to fill a huge book.Back in our environment of evolutionary adaptation, we could form gift-exchange relationships only with a few: our close neighbors, our good friends, and our near kin. Trust, you see, is necessary for a long-term gift-exchange relationship, and short-term such relationships are rare because each has to have and be willing to give up something the other wants or needs right now. And since we are largely self-interested, trust is hard to generate and maintain without other binding social ties.2. From Human Nature to Human SocietyHence the key importance of the human cultural invention of money in forming our large-scale human society: money means that any one of us can make a short-term one-shot exchange relationship with any other one of us, someone who we may well never see again. Money, you see, is manufactured trust, and it allows us to extend our societal division of labor to encompass, indirectly, nearly everybody else in the world.For example, consider the 30-foot bronze statue of Athene Promakhos— Athena Fighting-in-Front—that the council and people of Athens had cast and installed on the Acropolis around -450. The Greek geographer Pausanias wrote that anyone approaching Athens by sea by day could see her gleaming helmet and the tip of her spear as soon as they had rounded Sounion Head at the southern tip of Attika. 70 tons of bronze supposedly went into the statue, which survived until 1204—63 tons of copper, 7 tons of tin. Copper was abundant. But where in the -400s were the artisans of Athens to find 7 tons of tin? The historian Herodotos states that he could find nobody in Athens who knew where the tin was coming from: all anyone could say was that the ships had picked up the tin, already mined, in Sicily, and that they thought it came from \"tin islands\" in the ocean on the other side of Europe. But he could find nobody who would claim to have actually seen these tin islands, or this ocean on the other side of Europe. So he doubted the stories. The answer, of course, was that the tin was in Cornwall, at the southwestern tip of the island of Britain. The societal division of labor, as governed by the market, was a mechanism that \"knew\" that 7 tons of tin needed to be mined in Cornwall and then shipped, probably via the English Channel-Seine-portage-Rhone-Mediterranean route, to Athens via Sicily. And so it happened. But, apparently, nobody anywhere in the value chain knew its entire extent. The market knew things that no human individual knew. And this was almost 2.5 millennia ago: the market knows much, much, much more now. Language, weak dominance, gift exchange, and money have enabled us to progress from perhaps 10,000 of us 70,000 years ago living at a global average living standard of perhaps three 3.5 dollars a day to today's worldgirdling societal division of labor now 7.5 billion strong, with a global average standard of living no about $35 a day. We are now, collectively, on average, at least 10 times as well-off and 750,000 times as numerous as we were 70,000 years ago back in the environment of evolutionary adaptation when we last passed through a Darwinian bottleneck. 3. The \"System of Natural Liberty\" Adam Smith was a genius because he had a truly game-changing insight into how our societal division of labor should be organized. As far as the production and distribution of our collective material wealth is concerned, you see, most of what we need and want is both excludible and rival. If something is \"excludible\", that means we can assign it an owner—some one of us can be designated to control it, and to decide on its use, or decide to transfer \"ownership\" of it to something else. If something is excludible, we can push the decisions about how it is to be used out to the periphery of society, to the people on the ground who know what is going on, rather than have the decision made by some centralized bureaucracy clueless because of its inability to reliably judge information conveyed to it at third- or fourth-hand. Having \"ownership\" thus makes sense, if information about what is going on is dispersed and hard to assemble: giving control to people on the spot is then a very good idea. If something is \"rival\", that means that one person's use of it forecloses the opportunities of others: if I am using this iPhone, you cannot be using the same iPhone. If a good is rival, that one of us is using it diminishes the opportunities and possibilities available to others. That makes them poorer. Thus it makes sense to charge a price for somebody using a rival commodity. That makes them feel in their gut the effects of their decisions on the opportunities open to others. Charging prices is a way to align individuals' incentives about whether it is worth it for them to make use of a commodity with the effects of their decision on the overall well-being of the society. Hence, Adam Smith argued in his Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, the wealth of nations is most greatly enhanced by following the dictates of what he named the System of Natural Liberty —\"liberty\" because it leaves people free to do what they wanted with their labor and their possessions, \"natural\" because it conforms with human nature, \"system\" because it can be and is extended to the status of a general principle. Let people decide what they want to do with their things and their labor, and they arrange themselves in a large highly-productive societal division of labor. Self-interest focuses people on creating value. Competition curbs any distracting focus of self-interest on accomplishing exploitation. This \"System of Natural Liberty\" is, Smith argues, very good. As Heilbroner summarizes: Self-interest... drives men to action.... [But] a community activated only by self-interest would be a community of ruthless profiteers. This regulator is competition, the socially beneficial consequence of the conflicting selfinterests of all the members of society. For each man, out to do his best for himself with no thought of social cost, is faced with a flock of similarly motivated individuals who are in exactly the same boat.... A man who permits his self-interest to run away with him will find that competitors have slipped in... will find himself without buyers in the one case and without employees in the other. Thus very much as in the Theory of Moral Sentiments, the selfish motives of men are transmuted by interaction to yield the most unexpected of results: social harmony.... The... market is that it is its own guardian. If output or prices or certain kinds of remuneration stray away from their socially ordained levels, forces are set into motion to bring them back to the fold. It is a curious paradox which thus ensues: the market, which is the acme of individual economic freedom, is the strictest task master of all... This leads to a fraught question: Is this a theological point? Is the fact that acting \"naturally\" in the sense of giving market exchange free rein produces good results evidence that there is a benevolent Providence out there? Is this a teleological point? Are, in some sense, money and giftexchange aimed at creating prosperity? How is it that processes that are not human—that lead to consequences not desired directly by any human —have a mind of their own, and lead to good ends? It is indeed a marvel that, as Smith puts it, in his theory at least: [While] every individual... endeavours... to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value... labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can.... He... neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it.... He intends only his own security.... He intends only his own gain.... In this, as in many other cases, [he is] led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention...It is a marvel. But what kind of a marvel is it? Note that it is not that Smith is opposed to government. Government is necessary to protect property, and to enforce contracts: people—most people—will respect others' property and keep their own contracts, most of the time. But for the non-most people and at the non-most times we need the police, hence we need government. We need public works. We need public 6 2019-11-21 4339 words education. We need national defense. Adam Smith is very clear on all of these. In fact, Book V of the Wealth of Nations on what the government should do and how it should do it is the largest of the five parts of the book. But, Smith is certain, attempts of some centralized bureaucrat to undermine the System of Natural Liberty in its proper sphere—to direct who should do what when and where—were likely to produce not wealth and prosperity but poverty and misery. 4. Adam Smith & Poverty Adam Smith loathes poverty. Adam Smith is eager to create a society in which there is no poverty. Adam Smith spends a substantial amount of time investigating the course of poverty over time. For example, he takes time and care to write: During the course of the last century, taking one year with another, grain was dearer in both parts of the united kingdom than during that of the present.... It is equally certain that labour was much cheaper. If the labouring poor, therefore, could bring up their families then, they must be much more at their ease now. In the last century, the most usual day-wages of common labour through the greater part of Scotland were sixpence in summer, and fivepence in winter.... Through the greater part of the Low country, the most usual wages of common labour are now eight pence aday; tenpence, sometimes a shilling, about Edinburgh.... In England, the improvements of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, began much earlier than in Scotland. The demand for labour, and consequently its price, must necessarily have increased with those improvements. In the last century, accordingly, as well as in the present, the wages of labour were higher in England than in Scotland. They have risen, too, considerably since that time, though, on account of the greater variety of wages paid there in different places, it is more difficult to ascertain how much.... Not only grain has become somewhat cheaper, but many other things from which the industrious poor derive an agreeable and wholesome variety of food have become a great deal cheaper. Potatoes... cost half the price which they used to do thirty or forty years ago. The same thing may be said of turnips, carrots, cabbages; things which were formerly never raised but by the spade, but which are now commonly raised by the plough. All sort of garden stuff, too, has become cheaper.... The great improvements in the coarser manufactories of both linen and woollen cloth furnish the labourers with cheaper and better clothing; and those in the manufactories of the coarser metals, with cheaper and better instruments of trade, as well as with many agreeable and convenient pieces of household furniture... Which he then cross-checks with elite gossip: The common complaint that luxury extends itself even to the lowest ranks of the people, and that the labouring poor will not now be contented with the same food, clothing, and lodging which satisfied them in former times, may convince us that it is not the money price of labour only, but its real recompense, which has augmented... Having established that poverty has diminished, he next launches a fullbore attack on all those who claim this is a bad thing: Is this... to be regarded as an advantage or as an inconveniency?... Servants, labourers, and workmen... make up the far greater part.... What improves the circumstances of the greater part can never be regarded as an inconveniency to the whole. No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable... And then he makes a strong appeal to human solidarity, and to the reciprocal obligations humans undertake by entering into the gift-exchange relationships that knit society together: It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, clothe, and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodged... It is but equity, besides...\" This is a very strong appeal to human solidarity. It is coming from someone often seen as and sometimes dismissed as an apostle of human self-interest. 5. Adam Smith & Inequality 5.1. Inequality Generated Outside the Market: Smith's first way of minimizing the importance of inequality—or at least minimizing the responsibility of the market and of the economy for fighting inequality—is to argue that inequality springs from politics and sociology rather than from market economics. Inequality arises from the role that hierarchy and command-and-control play in the mixed-up processes that are human society. The society of England becomes more unequal because William the Bastard from Normandy and his thugs with spears—300 families, plus their retainers—kill King Harold Godwinson, and declare that everyone in England owes him and his retainers 1/3 of their crop. The society of England becomes more unequal because Queen Elizabeth I Tudor grants a monopoly over trade with America to Sir Walter Raleigh. Why? Because he had successfully flirted with her. These are not economic processes. These are not closely connected with the \"system of natural liberty\" that is the market economy.Indeed, the system of natural liberty is only one way you can organize society. Societies can be organized as ones of feudal lords and peasants, as priests and worshippers, robbers bands and their victims. But these ways of organizing society are impoverishing and, Smith claims in his very naming of his system the \"System of Natural Liberty\"—unnatural. Dugald Stewart quotes from one of Smith's lectures that, at least in the lecture hall at Glasgow in 1749, Smith was blunt: Little else is required to carry a state to the highest degree of affluence from the lowest barbarism but peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice; all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things... I believe that the later Adam Smith would note that \"tolerable administration of justice\" covers a lot of ground: the later books of An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations are very long indeed: Book III on how the historical development of Europe has let it to deviate from the System of Natural Liberty is 43 pages, Book IV on errors being made in 1776 by the governments of Europe is 273 pages, and Book V on what governments should and should not do is 276 pages—a total of 592 pages on what governments should, should not, and have unfortunately done, with only a total of 346 pages laying out Smith's analytical system and its conclusions, among them that: All governments which thwart this natural course, which force things into another channel, or which endeavor to arrest the progress of society at a particular point, are unnatural, and, to support themselves, are obliged to be oppressive and tyrannical... As Heilbroner puts it: The great enemy to Adam Smith's system is not so much government per se as monopoly—in any form. \"People... meet[ing] together... [and] the conversation ends in... some diversion to raise prices.\"... If the working of the market is trusted... anything that interferes... lowers social welfare. If, as in Smith's time, no master hatter anywhere in England could employ more than two apprentices or no master cutler in Sheffield more than one, the market system cannot possibly yield its full benefits.... If, as in Smith's time, great companies are given monopolies of foreign trade, the public cannot realize the full benefits of cheaper foreign produce. Hence, says Smith, all these impediments must go... 5.2. Wealth Inequality Prevents Worse Damage: Adam Smith's second way of minimizing the importance of economic inequality is to claim that it is a relatively gentle alternative to other forms of inequality that will emerge if economic inequality is reduced. Smith argues in Book III of the Wealth of Nations that the rise in inequality in market income and consumption went along with reduced inequality in social status and hierarchy—and in reduced societal violence as well. Great landlords who cannot earn and spend their wealth in the city will focus on arming and maintaining retainers, and the result will be that they will \"make war according to their own discretion, almost continually upon one another, and very frequently upon the king; and the open country still continued to be a scene of violence, rapine, and disorder\". But once there are luxuries to be purchased by wealth earned by selling produce to the growing cities, \"it was impossible that the number of their retainers should not as gradually diminish, till they were at last dismissed altogether\", and so peace came to the countryside. As John Maynard Keynes was to write a century and a half later: \"It is far better for a man to tyrannize over his bank balance than over his fellow citizens...\" 5.3. Smith Gets Snarky, Stoic, and Cynical: 5.3.1. Snarkism: Adam Smith's next way of minimizing the importance of economic inequality is to snark. The aim of wealth is to make you happy. Smith thinks that what wealthy women wish they could buy is beauty, and what wealthy men wish they could buy is strength. But who are the beautiful and strong in England? Adam Smith tells us in an aside on nutrition on the good qualities of the potato: The chairmen, porters, and coal-heavers in London, and those unfortunate women who live by prostitution, the strongest men and the most beautiful 11 2019-11-21 4339 words women perhaps in the British dominions, are said to be, the greater part of them, from the lowest rank of people in Ireland, who are generally fed with this root [the potato]... The rich aren't doing a terribly good job of using their wealth to promote human flourishing, are they? And there is the implication that the rich are none too happy. We see Smith, and what he is doing here, I think. 5.3.2. Stoicism: But Adam Smith's main way of minimizing the importance of economic inequality is to assume the philosophical pose of the stoic. You work hard. You sacrifice your peace and leisure in order to get rich. And what does that get you as you age? Adam Smith writes that to the aging, looking back at a life in which they have sacrificed their ease and their happiness in order to gain wealth: Power and riches appear then to be, what they are, enormous and operose machines contrived to produce a few trifling conveniencies to the body, consisting of springs the most nice and delicate, which must be kept in order with the most anxious attention, and which in spite of all our care are ready every moment to burst into pieces, and to crush in their ruins their unfortunate possessor. They are immense fabrics, which it requires the labour of a life to raise, which threaten every moment to overwhelm the person that dwells in them, and which while they stand, though they may save him from some smaller inconveniencies, can protect him from none of the severer inclemencies of the season. They keep off the summer shower, not the winter storm, but leave him always as much, and sometimes more, exposed than before, to anxiety, to fear, and to sorrow; to diseases, to danger, and to death... Who then benefits from all the industry and toil of the upwardly-mobile? Adam Smith argues that it was, somewhat paradoxically, the poor. The rich sacrifice their true happiness to set in motion enterprises. And the commodities produced by those enterprises are principally consumed by the poor: The earth by these labours of mankind has been obliged to redouble her natural fertility, and to maintain a greater multitude of inhabitants.... The proud and unfeeling landlord.... The capacity of his stomach bears no proportion to the immensity of his desires, and will receive no more than that of the meanest peasant. The rest he is obliged to distribute among those, who prepare, in the nicest manner, that little which he himself makes use of... all of whom thus derive from his luxury and caprice, that share of the necessaries of life, which they would in vain have expected from his humanity or his justice... 5.3.3. Cynicism: Last, Adam Smith minimizes the importance of economic inequality by claiming that there is little or nothing to be done about it. Human nature is such that people will seek to create, and then to obey, those whom they will call their superiors. It is the view expressed by Calvera in the movie The Magnificent Seven. Chico asks Calvera: And the people of the village? What about them? Calvera responds: I leave that to you. Can men of our profession worry about that? If God did not want them to be sheared, he would not have made them sheep! As Adam Smith puts it in his Theory of Moral Sentiments: A stranger to human nature, who saw the indifference of men about the misery of their inferiors, and the regret and indignation which they feel for the misfortunes and sufferings of those above them, would be apt to imagine, that pain must be more agonizing, and the convulsions of death 13 2019-11-21 4339 words more terrible to persons of higher rank, than they are to those of meaner stations. 'Upon this disposition... is founded the distinction of ranks, and the order of society. Our obsequiousness to our superiors more frequently arises from our admiration for the advantages of their situation, than from any private expectations of benefit from their goodwill.... We desire to serve them for their own sake, without any recompense but the vanity or the honour of obliging them... To attempt to eliminate inequality is, for Smith in his cynical mode, like trying to bail out the sea: make society equal, and people will find somebody to look up to, and then figure out a way to give their money away to the rich. So that is Adam Smith: worry about prosperity and wealth, yes; trust the (properly managed) \"system of natural liberty\", yes; worry about poverty and want, yes; worry about inequality, not so much.

      "content": "This is the latest in an occasional series called Writing Today, where I write about writing and media and publishing and the writing life in the 2020s. I was recently on the Changed My Mind podcast talking big think education stuff. Check it out.There's a certain image of the 2010s that I can't shake, though like most of my images these days what I'm picturing is bleary and indistinct. I'm walking around in New York back when I first moved there in the middle of last decade, kicking around, and I come across something like an American Apparel billboard in lower Manhattan, maybe Chelsea, and the billboard is all muted tones and cruel cheekbones, barely hiding its contempt for all of us down on the street. It's raining and I'm overdressed and I'm walking past a glowing Apple Store window where someone inside is buying a laptop that costs twice my rent, and perhaps there's a pack of young model-looking women walking by, and they laugh to each other, and my brain insists that they are laughing at me. I am in a place the does not want me, that rejects my presence with its own tacit being. There is a mood that might best be described as the romanticized aesthetic of meanness, the performative superiority of downtown cool, and it makes me think of Gawker. Gawker was aestheticized meanness. It was often cruel, this meanness, needlessly cruel, sometimes destructively so, but it was a kind of spitefulness that nevertheless insisted on itself, that meant something. It meant something even as Gawker was immolated by a capricious billionaire, even as it immolated itself.And then I open up my web browser and spend some time at the Ringer. The Ringer is not mean; the Ringer is a podcast. I'm not saying that the Ringer has a podcast network and is a podcast network, though it does and is. The Ringer is a podcast, itself, in a metaphysical sense: approachable, welcoming, unfocused, good-natured, self-deprecating, amiable, slightly sweaty, long-winded. The Ringer is slightly embarrassed about its ad reads but goes through with them with professional dedication. If Gawker was a suspiciously fashionable guy performatively glaring at your lame tote bag, the Ringer is your friend's boyfriend explaining NBA trade rules at a holiday cookout for forty-five minutes without stopping to breathe. Gawker was an inedibly bitter cocktail drunk by people who don't actually like it; the Ringer is a Bud Light Lime drunk by someone who apologizes for his bad taste but does. The vibe has shifted. We live in the tides of time and they swell and recede at paces uncontrollable by us.These two sites, Gawker as the avatar of the 2010s, the Ringer for the 2020s, are not perfect parallels and they are not perfect foils. But they are, in their own ways, quintessential media brands of their decades, and comparing them tells us a lot about the culture industries that shaped them. Gawker and the Ringer are both particular kinds of media dreams, cold foreboding New York skyscraper canyons vs sun-blasted traffic-snarled LA boulevards, one built on defiance and contempt, the other on access and enthusiasm. One smoked clove cigarettes while texting \"kill yourself\" to your favorite columnist; the other brings you a top-five ranking of NBA duos and their analogs in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Each posture offers its own kind of seduction. Each tells a story about what media is supposed to do, and what it's actually allowed to do, in its era. And I wonder if there will be such a thing as a publication that might define its era in the 2030s. I don't know. People are always underestimating what the audience wants, how much we're willing to pay for something bespoke and human; there are print magazines flourishing right now, if you know where to look. Americans buy a billion books a year and despite the relentless insistence that no one is reading them, people are reading them. Good things can survive. Somewhere there's a place for us. But masscult and midcult appear to be giving way to nocult, and Silicon Valley's relentless war on media does appear close to achieving a future where there's the New York Times and then the world of reaction videos and Twitch streams and get-ready-with-mes, one self-impressed ark of elite American tastemaking hovering above us like the spaceships from Independence Day and the rest of culture a howling blobbish mass of semipros making shortform video to blot out their own lives from the horizon of their minds. But I grow decadent here.Gawker's defining attribute was cruelty, more precisely stylish cruelty. It hated you, but it hated you in a way that flattered you. You had to be worth hating if you were hated and you had to be in on the joke to be one of the haters. It was insiderish to a fault, invested deeply in a taxonomy of New York relevance that was incomprehensible outside of a few zip codes and cocktail parties. That was the initial appeal, anyway, but as I and many others have said years before the Hogan trial Gawker's particular character had been stamped out by the dictates of clicks-based revenue models. Still, Gawker was a thing, and Gawker was mean because it could be. It was the mean girl with the best outfit and the worst sense of proportion. There's a kind of integrity to that, an underrated kind. I don't want to get carried away - I don't, in fact, think calling people ugly on the internet constitutes resistance, and ex-Gawker Media people's habit of retconning the place into a social justice factory is laughable - but Gawker's hostility served an ideological function: it said that media should not be friendly. It should not help people sell things. It should not talk to advertisers. It should not pretend that Lena Dunham's latest project is a cultural event just because HBO says it is. It insisted that media could still be oppositional, perhaps in the pettiest and most ineffective way imaginable but still in a way true to the reason media exists.The Ringer, by contrast, is friendly to a fault. If Gawker was the mean girls in season one of The White Lotus, the Ringer is the resort staff in any of the seasons, professionally welcoming, approachable in a pro-corporate way. The Ringer's tone is that of a group chat that's been accidentally made public, which is something like the platonic ideal of media for a large swath of the audience these days. There's no pretension to superiority, no interest in status as a weapon; status is awarded only by middlebrow arbiters like the Oscars or the reviews of Roger Ebert and his spiritual descendants. The Ringer is pointedly anti-snob. This is often refreshing, and I say that as a rabid partisan for the value of snobbery in cultural commentary. You don't get the sense that the Ringer hates you, or even dislikes you, or even evaluates you much; if Gawker offered the feeling of elitist insiderism by pulling you into a private joke, the Ringer exemplifies the cheerful indifference of a party where truly everyone is invited. The site's contributors, many of whom are very talented, have been trained to project maximum affability. And to be absolutely clear that affability is not faked, but cultivated. I am not accusing the Ringer of faking friendliness. The Ringer just is friendly. This is the ethos of podcast media: warm, forgiving, a little overfamiliar. The Ringer doesn't want to alienate you. It wants you to subscribe.That is the posture of the 2020s. You see it not just in the Ringer, but in the broader online discourse-industrial complex: the Reddit voice, the YouTube guy energy, the let's-hang-out streamers, the makeup tutorials in lieu of real friends, the low-level fandom of all things. The internet used to be cool; now it wants to be your buddy or your parasocial companion. Or, more apt here, your gambling enabler, the guy who tells you with a smiling sunny face that single-game parlays are a great idea, and it's seamless and easy to hook your credit card up to your DraftKings account. Which, to be clear, is not a reality under the control of the ordinary foot soldiers who make the #content. It's just that they work for a corporation. The Ringer is owned by an increasingly-predatory Swedish company that wants to own all of music and to use that power to gradually replace every human musician you ever loved with AI analogs that do not ask for royalties, but the people who work at the Ringer want only to occupy some of the last remaining seats in the macabre game of musical chairs that is digital media. I don't blame them. I fear that if the site closes I'll plunge into a terrible depression.There was something strange about Gawker's brand of insubordination: it was deeply invested in a kind of counterculture that it also sort of knew was dead. It sniped from the sidelines, but it still believed in the idea of cultural opposition. It cared about literature. It had an adversarial relationship with power. It was sarcastic about everything, but in the way that a disappointed idealist is sarcastic. It hated things because it believed things could be better. And then at some point something curdled in the publication as its younger writers increasingly tried to ape their own pinched vision of what Gawker style was, and the accusation that Gawker was simply directionlessly mean became more and more true; like seemingly all of us do, it became indistinguishable from the caricatures that had been made of it. It was easy, in the last few years, to ask what exactly all of the ample interpersonal cruelty was for.But if Gawker had a somewhat inconsistent attachment to the relationship between harshness and truth, the Ringer is not interested in that framework at all. If Gawker was a child of punk rock, the Ringer is the offspring of Comic-Con. It's obsessed with pop culture and, more to the point, with loving pop culture, with the idea of being the kind of person who is in love with pop culture, with being the kind of person who writes defenses of collecting Funko-Pop. Its writers often try to give even the dumbest streaming show the benefit of the doubt, as though criticism was a form of disloyalty. And this isn't always a bad thing. The Ringer has real cultural literacy - read Justin Charity or Brian Phillips or Katie Baker - and real taste. The perspective you get there is much more nuanced than the bland pro-everything boosterism it gets accused of. But it does not believe in counterculture. It believes in content.That's why so much of the site's writing is organized around celebration rather than analysis. It's also why so much of it is genuinely fun, like actual fun, and also why the site itself feels ideologically empty even as it produces thought-provoking essays at a pace that seems entirely unacknowledged by the industry. (There have been a ton of great essays out of the Ringer over the years, and yet this fact seems not to affect their reputation; unfortunately, my praise will only work against them and I'm sure most people who work there would rather I not voice it.) Still, the Ringer is in love with IP, and sometimes it's in love with the love of IP, which is worse. The whole project surrounding Hollywood and the culture industry is animated by the same force that animates its interest in sports gambling: a desire to be inside the system, to predict its movements, to master its codes. There is no interest in overturning anything. The Ringer knows that media is corporate. It just wants to make the best corporate media possible. And I do confess that at this point that probably amounts to an adult type of wisdom.Part of that, I'm afraid, is its worst element, which is the site's absolutely inveterate starfucking and name-dropping. HOLY SHIT, these people will not stop letting you know that they know famous people. Yes, I understand, we get it! LA, Hollywood, I'm on a first-name basis with Kevin Feige, woohoo! I'm very impressed that Damon Lindelof is here to talk about his new show, Upper-Middlebrow Masterpiece Theater. It's genuinely shameless. And yet there is a touch of something endearing there, a very human and admirably egalitarian admission that the people there like famous people and would like someday to be famous for themselves. The trouble is that this admirably forthright relationship to the American obsession with celebrity is often indistinguishable from compliance with corporate interests. Gawker, for all its smugness and destructiveness, did not want that. It didn't want to succeed within the system. It wanted to make you uncomfortable. It wanted to publish your emails. It wanted to burn down the village to save it. It failed, often and badly, by refusing to learn the difference between being provocative and merely being provoking. But Gawker failed trying to do something that wasn't reducible to brand management.There is also the matter of form. Gawker was the last great professional blog. It cared about the voice on the page, about cadence and rhythm and punchlines. They would make fun of anyone else if they used the word \"craft,\" to be clear, and this was part of their endlessly tiresome two-step about their own position in the creative culture - it was a site that mocked literary ambition in everyone else, written by a cohort of people who clearly had such ambitions themselves. And yet there was at least an undeniable sense of giving a shit about the product. The site didn't always do longform particularly well, though some of its writers would go on to do it extremely well elsewhere, but the team there cultivated a culture of short, sharp, cutting essays that were unmistakably personal. The ethos was bitchy, yes, but bitchy in a highly stylized way. Gawker was a collection of writers who wrote things and editors who edited them, and once that was enough.The Ringer is the home of the podcast, and more broadly of the podcast vibe. To repeat myself, its essays are consistently of a an excellent caliber, but written words are not its primary product. The site is an accessory to its audio empire, which is where the real money is. They make podcasts, and podcasts flatten things. They create intimacy at the cost of insight. They're long, but hangout long, not filled-with-information long, while Gawker was short, sometimes short in the service of being reductive but also short in the service of being sharp. The Ringer is affable where Gawker was precise, permissive where Gawker was punitive. The Ringer has built a whole ecosystem around the podcast as a medium of cultural digestion; it's media that melts in your mouth. And the inevitable cost of a podcast culture over an essay culture, aside from everything else, is that a great essay can be fractious and unlikable while still being riveting, but people only like podcasts that put out their lips to be kissed. The scripted podcast industry has collapsed while \"a few guys farting into a mic for three hours\" podcasting has flourished, after all. Essay culture rewards the outlier, the distinctive voice, and has room for work that slaps the reader in the face. Podcast culture rewards coherence, companionship, and the slow drip of consensus. You can still have insight in the latter medium, but it tends to be diluted by the endless need to fill time. Gawker built voices; the Ringer builds teams.Would I rather spend hours listening to podcasts with the genuinely sweet sweeties of the Ringer podcast network than read some desperately angry 24 year old at Gawker ritualistically disembowel a minor media figure who only half deserved it? Definitely. But that's the point: the only path left is the path of least resistance. Media is supposed to have higher aspirations than hanging out.Founders Nick Denton and Bill Simmons are, in many ways, perfect avatars of their respective media empires. Denton was the consummate 2010s media antagonist: slippery, cosmopolitan, prone to contradiction, and deeply invested in provocation as a moral good. He was often cagey about his own opinions, but delighted in airing everyone else's, weaponizing transparency as a form of power while maintaining a fierce protectiveness over aspects of his own privacy. Gawker's guiding ethos - publish what they don't want you to publish - was Denton's in miniature: it wasn't just that information should be free, it was that the media should go around freeing information for its own sake, even when the public interest was minimal and the human costs were considerable. His presence hung over the site like a challenge. His vision of journalism was adversarial, invasive, a little bit dirty, and matched a moment when media still clung to some notion of being outside the system. Denton wasn't trying to make friends. He was trying to make friction. And, more than anything, to make money.Simmons, by contrast, is the ultimate 2020s media bro: personable, prolific, and never far from a sponsored segment. His voice (literally and metaphorically) is everywhere on the Ringer, inflecting even the most highbrow content with the slightly nasal cadence of a guy explaining why \"Rocky III\" is underrated. If Denton stood for the idea that media should challenge power, Simmons stands for the idea that media should be accessible, self-referential, and above all, likable. His whole project has been about collapsing the space between critic and fan, between professional and audience. And that approach makes perfect sense in an era where the line between content and marketing is barely legible. Simmons isn't cynical about this blending; he's fluent in it. He's corporate media's best-case scenario: someone who genuinely loves the product. Simmons is a guy who certainly isn't afraid to take credit for things, so it can feel silly arguing that he doesn't get enough credit, but his ESPN columns were truly massively influential in writing for the web; he understood that, freed from column inches in dead tree publications, a column could serve as something you took in slowly in chunks over the course of three or four hours of your workday. That style went on to be much replicated. And while there's something sad and cynical about his abandonment of writing for podcasting, that too was prophetic for the industry. He has been remarkably adept at navigating the changing media landscape, and the upshot is a lot of talented people get to have jobs in the creative industry.I am, as you know, an inveterate snob, someone constantly accused of being personally mean, and a great champion of things that are hard because the world is hard. I am not a fan of affected chumminess and I think the world needs to become meaner for integrity to have any chance of survival. But this isn't a eulogy for Gawker or a hit piece on the Ringer. Both have flaws. Gawker was cruel, often pointlessly so. Its commitment to snark often came at the expense of truth, or empathy, or even basic coherence. Its politics were fuzzy and inconsistent but no less self-aggrandizing for it. The company's eventual collapse was a great scandal that represented a massive encroachment on free speech as a fickle billionaire destroyed the site for daring to report on the open secret of his homosexuality; the failure of many in media to sound the alarm bells was a profound mistake. Yet I confess that the company's collapse felt, in some ways, like an inevitable if not just outcome for a site that had often prioritized vendettas over values.The Ringer, for its part, can feel bloodless to the point that I imagine someone at Spotify making a list of KPIs for the site on a whiteboard and writing \"First, do no harm\" on it. Its embrace of the mainstream has made it immensely accessible but ideologically lightweight. It's everything you want in a media company except disruptive. It's smart, funny, likable, and totally friendly to capital. It makes room for a lot of great writing, but its dominant tone is cheerful concession. It feels safe. And the readymade defense of being safe, in media in 2025, is that no one can afford not to be. Simmons is famously antipathetic towards labor organizing at the Ringer, while Gawker eventually had a union. And you can see a future where every worker in media who asks for a little bit more is told that the industry can't afford more.I think you can tell a lot about these different approaches by their victims. You might look at AJ Daulerio, who during the Hogan saga was cast aside by Denton with almost comical indifference; his inability to help himself on the witness stand always struck me as being an expression of the risks of being in the truth telling business, of not knowing when you should just tell the pleasant lie. The whole affair left Daulerio penniless, and Denton surely knew he was suffering under a brutal addiction, and still Denton left him to rot. It was nasty work, and if you are among those who have little personal sympathy for Daulerio you might at least think that Denton owed him better. But it's also true that Denton's betrayal of Daulerio, something like Gawker's last act, was also very true to Gawker's spirit. However much you might want to reward the site for its commitment to relentlessly saying the quiet part out loud, it is a bare fact that the company chewed up and spit out workers who probably thought that the financial compensation, at least, would be a little bit better. A mean publication with little regard for human costs acted that way even in its own destruction.How could the Ringer have victims, you say! The Ringer's tone is so relentlessly cheerful, so full of inside jokes, fantasy drafts, and easy camaraderie, that it's easy to forget what it's actually helping to sell. But at the core of its business model now is sports gambling, and that will have victims. This is obviously much bigger than the Ringer; I cannot comprehend the tidal wave of human misery that the \"a casino in your pocket\" era of sports gambling is unleashing, will unleash. There's just something about the sweet-guy-you-met-at-a-sports-bar ethos of the Ringer taking part in this that makes it all seem a little more cruel. People will lose money they can't afford to lose because they trusted a voice that felt like a friend, because the hosts joked about parlays and player props like it was just another segment in the show. That's the genius of the Ringer's affect: it makes everything feel safe. The site doesn't look like a predatory operation. It looks like a podcast you've listened to for years - chummy, familiar. But the smiley, self-deprecating tone, so central to the Ringer's appeal, is precisely what allows a deeply cynical and damaging partnership with the gambling industry to flourish. That's the darkness underneath the friendliness: no one warns you when the content you love becomes a vehicle for your financial ruin.Denton used Daulerio up and threw him away, and he's had to work through shit for years to get back on his feet. That's cruelty with a cruel face. The Ringer will just keep telling people what parlays and teasers to hammer until they're dead broke, and after it happens they'll remind you that they ran a disclaimer at the end of every episode that absolves them of responsibility and guilt. That's cruelty with the face of a guy who loves sports and buffalo wings and Point Break just like you, and I don't need to tell you that that's much worse. I do acknowledge that most of the people at the Ringer have no control over the gambling content. They must make their own ethical decisions about their entanglement.What I'm really talking about, or trying to, is a transformation in what media is for. Gawker said media should make you uncomfortable. The Ringer says media should keep you company. One was too hostile to survive. The other is too friendly to resist. Gawker afflicted the powerful until it got sued into oblivion; along the way it lost any sense whatsoever of who exactly the powerful are and when exactly it does and does not make sense to throw somebody to the wolves. The Ringer makes Spotify money by helping people bet on NFL props. I'm not sure which is more depressing. Clearly, though, the former could no longer survive financially, not in a world where Buzzfeed couldn't survive, where Vice couldn't keep floating along on a cloud of cocaine and semi-ironic fashions. Maybe the Ringer still can. And every writer and editor who remains professionally employed in the 2020s, everyone who trades words for health insurance now, feels like a win to me.Whatever the truth, I do think something has been lost. I don't mourn Gawker Media, which increasingly had become a general interest site with none of its initial purview or mission and thus none of its energy, like how you turn on MTV and Comedy Central and E! and they're all running the same Law & Order reruns. But I certainly miss the aesthetic of meanness, even if I don't always miss the meanness itself. I miss the idea that media should have enemies. I miss New York cool, not because it was good - it was often self-parodic and ridiculous and always self-mythologizing - but because it was aspirational. Gawker wasn't \"better\" than the Ringer. But it believed in a different kind of literary culture, one built on sharpness, skepticism, and some residual belief in the value of being disliked.I read back that term, literary culture, and I feel kind of absurd for having produced it without really intending to. Can literary culture survive this? Not survive the Ringer, which is really not the enemy here, but survive the larger shift it represents. Can writing matter in a world that's structured to maximize friendliness and minimize friction? Can sentences compete with vibes? I don't know. Like I said, people still pay to eat at restaurants staffed with real chefs and waiters when they could eat food made on a literal assembly line. But the answer is still almost certainly no, literary culture can't survive, the kids don't want it, the adults have all collapsed into a state of permanent and total self-exoneration, and we are all amusing ourselves to death in exactly the way predicted by Neil Postman. People are lazy and selfish and they don't want to work for anything and the core of both literature and integrity is the notion that some things that are good are hard. Why bother, when you can drug yourself every night with so much YouTube that you forget your own name?The Ringer has produced some brilliant essays, work as good as anything in the old Gawker stable. I like several of the podcasts; they give young men what they want in a chummy bro-down podcast without all the reactionary baggage that is so common to the medium. The site has range. It has curiosity. It rewards intelligence. It deserves credit for all that. But it also exists within an ecosystem where criticism is mostly a branding tool, and where real oppositional writing is increasingly impossible to monetize. The Ringer is not the problem. The system, as ridiculous as I find the term in using it, is the problem. And it's worth asking whether the shift from Gawker's antagonism to the Ringer's affability represents a symptom of that system, a system in which being interesting is no longer enough, because being liked is so much more profitable, where the only media that can compete with a billion talentless amateurs staring into their front facing cameras is that which relentlessly embraces parasocial friendliness. So no, neither is better or worse, really. But Gawker felt dangerous, even if it was sometimes just mean. The Ringer feels like a product, even if it's often a good one and sometimes a very good one. And I wonder what that says about us.I can imagine, just barely, a synthesis of the two. A media project with Gawker's moral nerve and the Ringer's generous spirit, a place where the prose is sharp but not cruel, where the jokes land but don't seek out vulnerability for its own sake, where pop culture is treated seriously without being worshipped, and where writers are allowed to be both critics and fans without being reduced to brand ambassadors. A site that still believes in making enemies when necessary, but doesn't mistake bitterness for integrity. A site that knows how to say something true and still be fun. It's not impossible to create. It's just impossible to fund.Because I understand the finances of media far too well to believe such a thing could live. The incentives are wrong in every direction. Cruelty doesn't monetize, but neither does rigor. Skepticism doesn't scale. Podcasts pay. Listicles pay. Branded content pays. Being liked pays. There's no real room anymore for a media project that wants to be both brilliant and unbought. So we choose between the relics of a dead counterculture and the friendly face of total concession. I don't think either model is enough. I also don't think anyone's going to pay for something better.",

      "content": "At the start of July, I updated my estimates of equity risk premiums for countries, in an semiannual ritual that goes back almost three decades. As with some of my other data updates, I have mixed feelings about publishing these numbers. On the one hand, I have no qualms about sharing these estimates, which I use when I value companies, because there is no secret sauce or special insight embedded in them. On the other, I worry about people using these premiums in their valuations, without understanding the choices and assumptions that I had to make to get to them. Country risk, in particular, has many components to it, and while you have to ultimately capture them in numbers, I wanted to use this post to draw attention to the many layers of risk that separate countries. I hope, and especially if you are a user of my risk premiums, that you read this post, and if you do have the time and the stomach, a more detailed and much longer update that I write every year.Country Risk - DimensionsWhen assessing business risk from operating in a country, you will be affected by uncertainty that arises from almost every source, with concerns about political structure (democracies have very different risk profiles than authoritarian regimes), exposure to violence (affecting both costs and revenues), corruption (which operates an implicit tax) and legal systems (enforcing ownership rights) all playing out in business risk.I will start with political structure, where the facile answer is that it less risky to operate a business in a democracy than in an authoritarian regime, but where the often unpalatable truth is that each structure brings its own risks. With democracies, the risk is that newly elected governments can revisit, modify or discard policies that a previous government have adopted, requiring businesses to adapt and change to continuous changes in policy. In contrast, an authoritarian government can provide long term policy continuity, with the catch being that changes in the government, though infrequent, can create wrenching policy shifts that businesses have to learn to live with. Keeping the contrast between the continuous risk of operating in a democracy and the discontinuous risk in an authoritarian structure in mind, take a look at this picture of how the world looked in terms of democracy leading into 2025:Source: Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU)It is worth noting that there are judgment calls that the Economist made in measuring democracy that you and I might disagree with, but not only is a large proportion of the world under authoritarian rule, but the trend lines on this dimension also have been towards more authoritarianism in the last decade.On the second dimension, exposure to violence, the effects on business are manifold. In addition to the threat that violence can affect operations, its presence shows up as higher operating costs (providing security for employees and factories) and as insurance costs (if the risks can be insured). To measure exposure to violence, from both internal and external sources, I draw on measures developed and updated by the Institute of Economics & Peace across countries in 2024:Institute of Economics & PeaceThe Russia-Ukraine war has caused risk to flare up in the surrounding states and the Middle East and central Africa continue to be risk cauldrons, but at least according to the Institute's measures, the parts of the world that are least exposed to violence are in Northern Europe, Australia and Canada. Again, there are judgments that are made in computing these scores that will lead you to disagree with specific country measures (according the Peace Institute, the United States and Brazil have higher exposures to violence than Argentina and Chile, and India has more exposure to violence than China), but the bottom line is that there are significant differences in exposure to violence across the world.Corruption is a concern for everyone, but for businesses, it manifests in two ways. First, it puts more honest business operators at a disadvantage in a corrupt environment, since they are less willing to break the rules and go along with corrupt practices than their less scrupulous competitors. Second, even for those businesses that are willing to play the corruption game, it creates costs that I would liken to an implicit tax that reduces profits, cash flows and value. The measure of corruption that I use comes from Transparency International, and leading into July 2025, and the heat map below captures corruption scores (with higher scores indicating less corruption), as well as the ten most and least corrupt countries in the world:Transparency InternationalAs you can see from the map, there are vast swaths of the world where businesses have to deal with corruption in almost every aspect of business, and while some may attribute this to cultural factors, I have long argued that corruption almost inevitably follows in bureaucratic settings, where you need licenses and approvals for even the most trivial of actions, and the bureaucrats (who make the licensing decisions) are paid a pittance relative to the businesses that they regulate. As a final component, I look at legal systems, especially when it comes to enforcing contractual agreements and property rights, central to running successful businesses. Here, I used estimates from the IPRI, a non-profit institution that measures the quality of legal systems around the world. In their latest rankings from 2024, here is how countries measured up in 2024:Property Rights AllianceIn making these assessments, you have to consider not just the laws in place but also the timeliness with which these laws get enforced, since a legal system where justice is delayed for years or even decades is almost as bad as one that is capricious and biased.Country Risk - MeasuresThe simplest and most longstanding measure of country risk takes the form of sovereign ratings, with the same agencies that rate companies (S&P, Moody's and Fitch) also rating countries, with the ratings ranging from Aaa (safest) to D (in default). The number of countries with sovereign ratings available on them has surged in the last few decades; Moody's rated 13 countries in 1985, but that number increased to 143 in 2025, with the figure below listing the number of rated countries over time:Note that that the number of Aaa rated countries stayed at eleven, even while more countries were rated, and has dropped from fifteen just a decade ago, with the UK and France losing their Aaa ratings during that period. In May 2025, Moody's downgraded the United States, bringing them in line with the other ratings agencies; S&P downgraded the US in 2011 and Fitch in 2023. The heat map below captures sovereign ratings across the world in July 2025:Moody'sWhile sovereign ratings are useful risk measures, they do come with caveats. First, their focus on default risk can lead them to be misleading measures of overall country risk, especially in countries that have political risk issues but not much default risk; the Middle East, for instance, has high sovereign ratings. Second, the ratings agencies have blind spots, and some have critiqued these agencies for overrating European countries and underrating Asian, African and Latin American countries. Third, ratings agencies are often slow to react to events on the ground, and ratings changes, when they do occur, often lag changes in default risk. If you are leery about trusting ratings agencies, I understand your distrust, and there is an alternative measure of sovereign default risk, at least for about half of all countries, and that is the sovereign credit default swap (CDS) market, which investors can buy protection against country default. These market-determined numbers will reflect events on the ground almost instantaneously, albeit with more volatility than ratings. At the end of June 2025, there were about 80 countries with sovereign CDS available on them, and the figure below captures the values:The sovereign CDS spreads are more timely, but as with all market-set numbers, they are subject to mood and momentum swings, and I find using them in conjunction with ratings gives me a better sense of sovereign default risk. If default risk seems like to provide too narrow a focus on countr risk, you can consider using country risk scores, which at least in principle, incorporate other components of country risk. There are many services that estimate country risk scores, including the Economist and the World Bank, but I have long used Political Risk Services (PRS) for my scores.. The PRS country risk scores go from low to high, with the low scores indicative of more country risk, and the table below captures the world (at least according to PRS):Political Risk Services (PRS)There are some puzzling numbers here, with the United States coming in as riskier than Vietnam and Libya, but that is one reason why country risk scores have never acquired traction. They vary across services, often reflecting judgments and choices made by each service, and there is no easy way to convert these scores into usable numbers in business and valuation or compare them across services.Country Risk - Equity Risk PremiumsMy interest in country risk stems almost entirely from my work in corporate finance and valuation, since this risk finds its way into the costs of equity and capital that are critical ingredients in both disciplines. To estimate the cost of equity for an investment in a risky country. I will not claim that the approaches I use to compute equity risk premiums for countries are either original or brilliant, but they do have the benefit of consistency, since I have used them every year (with an update at the start of the year and mid-year) since the 1990s. The process starts with my estimate of the implied equity risk premium for the S&P 500, and I make this choice not for parochial reasons but because getting the raw data that you need for the implied equity risk premium is easiest to get for the S&P 500, the most widely tracked index in the world. In particular, the process requires data on dividends and stock buybacks on the stocks in the index, as well as expected growth in these cash flows over time, and involves finding the discount rate (internal rate of return) that makes the present value of cash flows equal to the level of the index. On June 30, 2025, this assessment generated an expected return of 8.45% for the index:Download ERP spreadsheetUntil May 2025, I just subtracted the US 10-year treasury bond rate from this expected return, to get to an implied equity risk premium for the index, with the rationale that the US T.Bond rate is the riskfree rate in US dollars. The Moody's downgrade of the US from Aaa to Aa1 has thrown a wrench into the process, since it implies that the T.Bond rate has some default risk associated with it, and thus incorporates a default spread. To remove that risk, I net out the default spread associated with Aa1 rating from the treasury rate to arrive at a riskfree rate in dollars and an equity risk premium based on that:Riskfree rate in US dollars = T.Bond rate minus Default Spread for Aa1 rating = 4.24% - 0.27% = 3.97%Implied equity risk premium for US = Expected return on S&P 500 minus US $ riskfree rate = 8.45% - 3.97% = 4.48%Note that this approach to estimating equity risk premiums is model agnostic and reflects what investors are demanding in the market, rather than making a judgment on whether the premium is right or what it should be (which I leave to market timers). To get the equity risk premiums for other countries, I need a base premium for a mature market, i.e., one that has no additional country risk, and here again, the US downgrade has thrown a twist into the process. Rather than use the US equity risk premium as my estimate of the mature market premium, my practice in every update through the start of 2025, I adjusted that premium (4.48%) down to take out the US default spread (0.27%), to arrive at the mature market premium of 4.21%. That then becomes the equity risk premium for the eleven countries that continue to have Aaa ratings, but for all other countries, I estimate default spreads based upon their sovereign ratings. As a final adjustment, I scale these default spreads upwards to incorporate the higher risk of equities, and these become the country risk premiums, which when added to the mature market premium, yields equity risk premiums by country. The process is described below: Download spreadsheetThe results from following this process are captured in the picture below, where I create both a heat map based on the equity risk premiums, and report on the ratings, country risk premiums and equity risk premiums, by country:Download equity risk premium, by countryIf you compare the equity risk premium heat map with the heat maps on the other dimensions of country risk (political and legal structures, exposure to violence and corruption), you will notice the congruence. The parts of the world that are most exposed to corruption and violence, and have capricious legal systems, tend to have higher equity risk premiums. The effects of the US ratings downgrade also manifest in the table, with the US now having a higher equity risk premium than its Aaa counterparts in Northern Europe, Australia and Canada.A User's Guide My estimates of equity risk premiums, by country, are available for download, and I am flattered that there are analysts that have found use for these number. One reason may be that they are free, but I do have concerns sometimes that they are misused, and the fault is mine for not clarifying how they should be used. In this section, I will lay out steps in using these equity risk premiums in corporate finance and valuation practice, and if I have still left areas of grey, please let me know.Step 1: Start with an understanding of what the equity risk premium measuresThe starting point for most finance classes is with the recognition that investors are collectively risk averse, and will demand higher expected returns on investments with more risk. The equity risk premium is a measure of the \"extra\" return that investors need to make, over and above the riskfree rate, to compensate for the higher risk that they are exposed to, on equities collectively. In the context of country risk, it implies that investments in riskier countries will need to earn higher returns to beat benchmarks than in safer countries. Using the numbers from July 2025, this would imply that investors need to earn 7.46% more than the riskfree rate to invest in an average-risk investment in India, and 10.87% more than the riskfree rate to invest in an average risk investment in Turkey. It is also worth recognizing how equity risk premiums play out investing and valuation. Increasing the equity risk premium will raise the rate of return you need to make on an investment, and by doing so, reduce its value. That is why equity risk premiums and stock prices move inversely, with the ERP rising as stock prices drop (all other thins being held constant) and falling as stock prices increase.Step 2: Pick your currency of analysis (and estimate a riskfree rate) I start my discussions of currency in valuation by positing that currency is a choice, and that not only can you assess any project or value any company in any currency, but also that your assessment of project worth or company value should not be affected by that choice. Defining the equity risk premium as the extra return that investors need to make, over and above the risk free rate, may leave you puzzled about what riskfree rate to use, and while the easy answer is that it should be the riskfree rate in the currency you chose to do the analysis in, it is worth emphasizing that this riskfree rate is not always the government bond rate, and especially so, if the government does not have Aaa rating and faces default risk. In that case, you will need to adjust the government bond rate (just as I did with the US dollar) for the default spread, to prevent double counting risk.Staying with the example of an Indian investment, the expected return on an average-risk investment in Indian rupees would be computed as follows:Indian government bond rate on July 1, 2025 = 6.32%Default spread for India, based on rating on July 1, 2025 = 2.16%Indian rupee risk free rate on July 1, 2025 = 6.32% - 2.16% = 4.16%ERP for India on July 1, 2025 = 7.46%Expected return on average Indian equity in rupees on July 1, 2025 = 4.16% + 7..46% = 11.62%Note also that if using the Indian government bond rate as the riskfree rate in rupees, you would effectively be double counting Indian country risk, once in the government bond rate and once again in the equity risk premium.I know that the ERP is in dollar terms, and adding it to a rupee riskfree rate may seem inconsistent, but it will work well for riskfree rates that are reasonably close to the US dollar risk free rate. For currencies, like the Brazilian real or Turkish lira, it is more prudent to do your calculations entirely in US dollars, and convert using the differential inflation rate:US dollar riskfree rate on July 1, 2025 = 3.97%ERP for Turkey on July 1, 2025 = 10.87%Expected return on average Turkish equity in US $ on July 1, 2025 = 3.97% + 10.87% = 14.84%Expected inflation rate in US dollars = 2.5%; Expected inflation rate in Turkish lira = 20%Expected return on average Turkish equity Turkish lira on July 1, 2025 = 1.1484 *(1.20/1.025) -1 = 34.45%Note that this process scales up the equity risk premium to a higher number for high-inflation currencies.Step 3: Estimate the equity risk premium or premiums that come into play based on operationsMany analysts use the equity risk premiums for a country when valuing companies that are incorporated in that country, but I think that is too narrow a perspective. In my view, the exposure to country risk comes from where a company operates, not where it is incorporated, opening the door for bringing in country risk from emerging markets into the cost of equity for multinationals that may be incorporated in mature markets. I use revenue weights, based on geography, for most companies, but I am open to using production weights, for natural resource companies, and even a mix of the two.In corporate finance, where you need equity risk premiums to estimate costs of equity and capital in project assessment, the location of the project will determine which country's equity risk premiums come into play. When Amazon decides to invest in a Brazilian online retail project, it is the equity risk premium for Brazil that should be incorporated, with the choice of currency for analysis determining the riskfree rate.Step 4: Estimate project-specific or company-specific risk measures and costs The riskfree rate and equity-risk premiums are market-wide numbers, driven by macro forces. To complete this process, you need two company-specific numbers:Not all companies or projects are average risk, for equity investors in them, and for companies that are riskier or safer than average, you need a measure of this relative risk. At the risk of provoking those who may be triggered by portfolio theory or the CAPM, the beta is one such measure, but as I have argued elsewhere, I am completely at home with alternative measures of relative equity risk. The cost of equity is calculated as follows:Cost of equity = Riskfree rate + Beta × Equity Risk PremiumThe beta (relative risk measure) measures the risk of the business that the company/project is in, and for a diversified investor, captures only risk that cannot be diversified away. While we are often taught to use regressions against market indices to get these betas, using industry-average or bottom-up betas yields much better estimates for projects and companies.For the cost of debt, you need to estimate the default spread that the company will face. If the company has a bond rating, you can use this rating to estimate the default spread, and if it is not, you can use the company's financials to assess a synthetic rating.Cost of debt =Riskfree Rate + Default spreadHarking back to the discussion of riskfree rates, a company in a country with sovereign default risk will often bear a double burden, carrying default spreads for both itself and the country.The currency choice made in step two will hold, with the riskfree rate in both the cost of equity and debt being the long-term default free rate in that currency (and not always the government bond rate).Step 5: Ensure that your cash flows are currency consistent The currency choice made in step 2 determines not only the discount rates that you will be using but also the expected cash flows, with expected inflation driving both inputs. Thus, if you analyze a Turkish project in lira, where the expected inflation rate is 20%, you should expect to see costs of equity and capital that exceed 25%, but you should also see growth rates in the cash flows to be inflated the same expected inflation. If you assess the same project in Euros, where the expected inflation is 2%, you should expect to see much lower discount rates, high county risk notwithstanding, but the expected growth in cash flows will also be muted, because of the low inflation.There is nothing in this process that is original or path-breaking, but it does yield a systematic and consistent process for estimating discount rates, the D in DCF. It works for me, because I am a pragmatist, with a valuation mission to complete, but you should feel free to adapt and modify it to meet your concerns.YouTube VideoPaperCountry Risk Determinants: Determinants, Measures and Implications - The 2025 EditionDatasetsEquity Risk Premiums, by country - July 2025Country Risk LinksEIU Democracy IndexGlobal Peace Index (Exposure to Violence)Corruption IndexInternational Property Rights IndexMoody's Sovereign RatingsPolitical Risk Services (PRS) Country Risk ScoresSpreadsheetsImplied Equity Risk Premium for S&P 500 on July 1, 2025",

      "content": "\"The Reading Lesson,\" by Leon Basile Perrault (1866)What is literacy lag?Children today grow up under a tyrannical asymmetry: exposed to screens from a young age, only much later do we deign to teach them how to read. So the competition between screens vs. reading for the mind of the American child is fundamentally unfair. This is literacy lag.Despite what many education experts would have you believe, literacy lag is not some natural or biological law. Children can learn to read very early, even in the 2-4 age range, but our schools simply take their sweet time teaching the skill; usually it is only in the 7-8 age range that independent reading for pleasure becomes a viable alternative to screens (and often more like 9-10, as that's when the \"4th grade slump\" occurs, based on kids switching from academic exercises to actually reading to learn). Lacking other options, children must get their pre-literate media consumption from screens, which they form a lifelong habitual and emotional attachment to. Nowadays, by the age of 6, about 62% of children in the US have a personal tablet of their own, and children in the 5-8 age range experience about 3.5 hours of screen time a day (increasingly short-form content, like YouTube Shorts and TikTok).I understand why. Parenting is hard, if just because filling a kid's days and hours and minutes and seconds is, with each tick of the clock, itself hard. However, I noticed something remarkable from teaching my own child to read. Even as a rowdy \"threenager,\" he got noticeably easier as literacy kicked in. His moments of curling up with a book became moments of rejuvenating parental calm. And I think this is the exact same effect sought by parents giving their kids tablets at that age. Acting up in the car? Have you read this book? Screaming wildly because you're somehow both overtired and undertired? Please go read a book and chill out!This is because reading and tablets are directly competitive media for a child's time.1 So while independent reading requires about a year of upfront work, and takes anywhere from 10-30 minutes a day, after that early reading feels a lot like owning a tablet (and while reading is no panacea, neither are tablets).The cultural reliance on screen-based media is not because parents don't care. I think the typical story of a new American parent, a quarter of the way through this 21st century of ours, goes like this: initially, they do care about media exposure, and often read to their baby and young toddler regularly. This continues for 2-3 years. However, eventually the inconvenience of reading requiring two people pressures parents to switch to screens.2 The category of \"not playing, and not doing a directed or already set up activity, but just quietly consuming media\" is simply too large and deep for parents to fill just by reading books aloud. In fact, not providing screens can feel impoverishing, because young children have an endless appetite for new information.Survey data support this story: parental reading to 2-year-olds has actually increased significantly since 2017, but kids in the 5-8 range get exposed to reading much less. Incredibly, the average 2-year-old is now more likely to be exposed to reading than the average 8-year-old!The 2025 Common Sense Census: Media Use by Kids Zero to EightSelf reports also fit this story: parents acknowledge they do a better job at media use when it comes to their 2-year-olds compared to their 8-year-olds, and the drop-off is prominent during the literacy lag.The 2025 Common Sense Census: Media Use by Kids Zero to EightSo despite American parents' best efforts to prioritize reading over screen usage for their toddlers, due to our enforced literacy lag, being a daily reader is a trait easily lost early on, and then must be actively regained rather than maintained.Subscribe nowOnce lost, reading often doesn't recover. Even when surveyed from a skeptical perspective, reading is, almost everywhere, in decline.3 This is supported by testimonials from teachers (numerous op-eds, online threads, the entire horror show that is the /r/Teachers subreddit), as well as the shrinking of assigned readings into fragmented excerpts rather than actual books. At this point, only 17% of educators primarily assign whole books (i.e., the complete thoughts of authors), and some more pessimistic estimates put this percentage much lower, like how English Language Arts curricula based on reading whole books are implemented in only about 5% of classrooms. On top of all this, actual objective reading scores are now the lowest in decades.I think literacy lag is a larger contributor to this than anyone suspects; we increasingly live in a supersensorium, so it matters that literature is fighting for attention and relevancy with one hand tied behind its back for the first 8 years of life.So then...Why are education experts so against early reading?In a piece that could have been addressed to me personally, last month the LA Times published:Hey! While it doesn't actually reference my growing guide on early reading (we're doing early math next, so stay tuned), what this piece in the LA Times reveals is how traditional education experts have tied themselves up in knots over this question. E.g., the LA Times piece contains statements like this:\"Can a child learn individual letters at 2½ or 3? Sure. But is it developmentally appropriate? Absolutely not,\" said Susan Neuman, a professor of childhood and literacy education at New York University.Now, to give you a sense of scale here, Susan Neuman is a highly-cited researcher and, decades ago, worked on implementing No Child Left Behind. She also appears to think it's developmentally inappropriate to teach a 3-year-old what an \"A\" is. And this sort of strange infantilization appears to be widespread.\"When we talk about early literacy, we don't usually think about physical development, but it's one of the key components,\" said Stacy Benge, author of The Whole Child Alphabet: How Young Children Actually Develop Literacy. Crawling, reaching across the floor to grab a block, and even developing a sense of balance are all key to reading and writing, she said. \"In preschool we rob them of those experiences in favor of direct instructions,\" said Benge.Subscribe nowYet is crawling across the floor to grab a block really the normal developmental purview of preschool? Kids in preschool are ambulatory. Bipedal. Possessing opposable thumbs, they can indeed pick up blocks. Preschool usually starts around the 3-4 age range, often requiring the child to be potty-trained. Preschoolers are entire little people with big personalities. Moreover, by necessity preschool is still mostly (although not entirely) play-based in terms of the learning and activities, if only because there is zero chance a room of 3-year-olds could sit at desks for hours on end.This all seems off. Surely, there must be some robust science behind this fear of teaching reading too early?4 It turns out, no. It's just driven by...Neuromyths about early reading.The LA Times piece leans heavily on the opinions of cognitive neuroscientist Maryanne Wolf, who is well-known for her work in education and the science of reading:For the vast majority of children, research suggests that ages 5 to 7 are the prime time to teach reading, said Maryanne Wolf, director of the Center for Dyslexia, Diverse Learners and Social Justice at UCLA.\"I even think that it's really wrong for parents to ever try to push reading before 5,\" because it is \"forcing connections that don't need to be forced,\" said Wolf.Reading words off a page is a complex activity that requires the brain to put together multiple areas responsible for different aspects of language and thought. It requires a level of physical brain development called mylenation [sic] — the growth of fatty sheaths that wrap around nerve cells, insulating them and allowing information to travel more quickly and efficiently through the brain. This process hasn't developed sufficiently until between 5 and 7 years old, and some boys tend to develop the ability later than girls.If she had a magic wand, Wolf said she would require all schools in the U.S. to wait until at least age 6.That's a strong opinion! I wanted to know the scientific evidence, so I dusted off Maryanne Wolf's popular 2007 book, Proust and the Squid: The Story and Science of the Reading Brain from my library. The section \"When Should a Young Child Begin to Read?\" makes identical arguments to those that Wolf makes in the LA Times article, wherein myelination is cited as a reason to delay teaching reading. Wolf writes that:The behavioral neurologist Norman Geschwind suggested that for most children myelination of the angular gyrus region was not sufficiently developed till school age, that is, between 5 and 7 years.... Geschwind's conclusions about when a child's brain is sufficiently developed to read receive support from a variety of cross-linguistic findings.Yet while Geschwind's highly-cited paper is a classic of neuroscience, it is also 60 years old, highly dense, notoriously difficult to read, and ultimately contains mere anatomical observations and speculations, mostly about things far beyond these subjects. Nor do I find, after searching within it, a clear statement of this hypothesis as described. E.g., in one part, Geschwind seems to speculate that the angular gyrus being underdeveloped is the cause of dyslexia, but this is not the same as saying that finished development is a requisite for reading in normal children. Instead, there is a part where he speculates that reading can be acquired after the ability to name colors, but naming colors can often occur quite early, and varies widely (e.g., plenty, but not all, toddlers can name colors well).Regardless of whatever Geschwind actually believed, this 60-year-old paper would be a very old peg to hang a hat on. Modern studies don't show myelination as a binary switch: e.g., temporal and angular gyri exhibit \"rapid growth\" between 1-2 years old, likely driven by myelination, and there is \"high individual developmental variation\" of myelination in general in the 2-5 age range, and also myelination, since it's an anatomical expression of brain development, is responsive to learning itself. Subscribe nowOverall, theories positing cognitive closure based on myelin development (especially after the 1-2 age range) are not well-supported. This is because, brain-wide, the ramp up in myelination occurs mostly within the first ~500 days of life (before 2 years old), leveling off afterward to a gentle slope that can last for decades in some areas.From \"Characterizing longitudinal white matter development during early childhood\" (Dean III et al., 2015)So then, what about the \"cross-linguistic findings\" that supposedly provide empirical support for a ban on early reading? Wolf writes in Proust and the Squid that:The British reading researcher Usha Goswami drew my attention to a fascinating cross-language study by her group. They found across three different languages that European children who were asked to begin to learn to read at age five did less well than those who began to learn at age seven. What we conclude from this research is that the many efforts to teach a child to read before four or five years of age are biologically precipitate and potentially counterproductive for many children.But the main takeaway from Goswami herself appears to be the opposite. Here is Goswami describing, in 2003, her work of the time:Children across Europe begin learning to read at a variety of ages, with children in England being taught relatively early (from age four) and children in Scandinavian countries being taught relatively late (at around age seven). Despite their early start, English-speaking children find the going tough.... The main reason that English children lag behind their European peers in acquiring proficient reading skills is that the English language presents them with a far more difficult learning problem.In other words, German and Finnish and so on are just easier languages to master than English, and phonics works more directly within them, so of course the kids in those countries have an easier time—and they start school later, too. As Goswami explicitly says, \"it is the spelling system and not the child that causes the learning problem....\"5 So no, teaching children to read at four or five, or even younger, is not \"biologically precipitate.\" It is also contradicted by the simple fact that...Children used to learn to read at ages 2-4!Here is from the 1660 classic A New Discovery of the Old Art of Teaching Schoole by Charles Hoole, an English educator who himself was a popular education expert of his day (running a grammar school and writing monographs and books).I observe that betwixt three and four years of age a childe hath great propensity to peep into a book, and then is the most seasonable time (if conveniences may be had otherwise) for him to begin to learn; and though perhaps then he cannot speak so very distinctly, yet the often pronounciation of his letters, will be a means to help his speech...And his writings about toddler literacy (which, by the way, are based in phonics), contain anecdotes of parents teaching their children letters at age 2.5, and of children being able to read the dense and complex language of the Bible shortly after the age of 4. As across the pond, so here too. Rewind time to observe the early Puritans of America, and you would have found it common for mothers to teach their children earlier than we do now, using hornbooks and primers (it was Massachusetts law that parents had to teach their children to read). Perhaps the most famous case of teaching very early reading, and the enduring popularity of the act, comes from Anna Laetitia Barbauld (1743-1825), who was a well-known essayist and poet and educator of her day, and wrote primers aimed at children under the instruction of their governess or mother. These primers \"provided a model for more than a century.\" English Professor William McCarthy, who wrote a biography of Anna Laetitia Barbauld, noted that her primers...were immensely influential in their time; they were reprinted throughout the nineteenth century in England and the United States, and their effect on nineteenth- and early twentieth-century middle-class people, who learned to read from them, is incalculable.These \"immensely influential\" primers possess very revealing titles.Lessons for Children of 2 to 3 Years Old (1778)Lessons for Children of 3 Years Old, Part I and Part II (1778)Lessons for Children of 3 to 4 Years Old (1779).Yup, that's right! Some of the most famous and successful primers ever were explicitly designed for children in the 2-4 age range. Anna Barbauld wrote it so she could teach her nephew Charles how to read, and those years track Charles' age himself—he really was 4 in 1779.Lessons For Children: From 2 to 3 Years OldOriginally printed \"sized to fit a child's hand,\" these primers contain what would be considered today wildly advanced, almost unbelievable, prose for the 2-4 age range. Even just perusing the first volume I find irregular vowels and long sentences and other complexities; things more associated with, realistically, a modern 2nd grade level (assuming a good student, too). And so, even given an extra year or two as advantage (as admittedly, some of the same era thought Barbauld's books were titled presumptively, and recommended them instead for the 4-5 age range), there is probably a vanishingly small number of kids in the entire modern world who'd currently be Charles' literary equals, and could read an updated version of this primer.6The past, as they say, is a foreign country. Education practices, particularly the European tradition of \"aristocratic tutoring,\" were quite different. Back in 1869, Charlotte Mary Yonge wrote of Barbauld's hero \"little Charles\" that the primers about him were particularly influential in the upper-class and aristocracy:Probably three fourths of the gentry of the last three generations have learnt to read by his assistance.7Perhaps it's a mirror to our own age, and early reading becoming reserved for \"gentry\" is what modern education experts actually fear, deep down. Their concerns are about equity, grades, and whether it's okay to \"push kids into the academic rat race.\" I'm not dismissing such concerns, nor saying that debate is easily solvable. Rather, my point is that there's an entire dimension to reading that's been seemingly forgotten: in the end, reading isn't about grades or test scores. It's about how kids spend their time. That's what matters. In some ways, it matters more than anything that ever happens in schools. And right now, literacy is losing an unfair race.We appear to be entering a topsy-turvy world, where the future is here, just not distributed along the socioeconomic gradient you'd expect. It's a world in which it is a privilege to grow up not with, but free of, the latest technology. And I've come to believe that learning to read, as early as possible, is a form of that freedom.Besides, Barbauld's introduction to her primers ends with the appropriate rejoinder to any gatekeeping of reading, by age or otherwise:For to lay the first stone of a noble building, and to plant the first idea in a human mind, can be no dishonor to any hand.Subscribe nowIf you want to check out my own guide for teaching early reading (aimed at getting kids reading for pleasure), see parts 1, 2, 3 and 4. I'm putting them all together into an updated monograph (coming soon).1That TV competes with reading has been called the \"displacement hypothesis\" in the education literature. It's pretty obvious that the effect is even stronger for tablets. While literacy lag existed decades ago, it was less impactful, because the availability for entertainment was more limited and not personalized (e.g., Saturday morning cartoons in the living room vs. algorithmically-fine-tuned infinite Cocomelon on the go).2Admittedly, this dichotomy of \"screen time\" vs. reading is a simplification, because \"screen time\" is a big tent. Beautiful animated movies are screen time. Whale documentaries are screen time. Educational apps are screen time. But in rarer studies that look specifically at things like reading for pleasure, it's clear that using screens for personal entertainment (like the tablet usage I'm discussing here) is usually negatively correlated to [pick your trait or outcome].3The naysaying that reading is not in decline comes from education experts arguing that labels like \"proficiency\" on surveys represent a higher bar than people think, and that not being proficient doesn't technically mean illiterate. Which is something, I suppose.4Shout out to Theresa Roberts, the only education expert quoted in the LA Times piece going against the majority opinion.But there are also experts who say letter sounds should be taught to 3-year-olds in preschool. \"Children at age 3 are very capable,\" said Theresa Roberts, a former Sacramento State child development professor who researches early childhood reading.And it doesn't have to be a chore, she said. Her research found that 3- and 4-year-olds were \"highly engaged\" during 15-minute phonics lessons, and they were better prepared in kindergarten.5Wolf does mention that orthographic regularity is a confound in a later 2018 piece, but still draws the same conclusion from the research. Meanwhile, in a 2006 review written by Goswami herself and published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience called \"Neuroscience and education: from research to practice?\" Goswami doesn't mention a biologically-based critical period for learning to read. Instead, using the example of synaptogenesis, she refers to ideas around such critical periods as \"myths.\"The critical period myth suggests that the child's brain will not work properly if it does not receive the right amount of stimulation at the right time... These neuromyths need to be eliminated.6It's worth noting that Anna Barbauld's primers are beautifully written. Constructed as a one-sided dialogue (a \"chit chat\") with Charles, Barbauld dispenses wisdom about the natural world, about plants, animals, money, pets, hurts, geology, astronomy, morality and mortality. In this, it is vastly superior to contemporary early readers: it is written from within a child's umwelt, which (and this is Barbauld's true literary innovation) occurs via linguistic pointers from parents to things of the child's daily world (this hasn't changed much, e.g., the first volume ends at Charles' bedtime). Barbauld may have also originated the use of reader-friendly large font, with extra white space, designed to go easy on toddler eyes (still a huge problem in early reading material, hundreds of years later). 7If you are surprised to learn that the gentry (i.e., the upper class of the aristocracy, sizable land-owners, wealthy merchants, etc.) of Europe during the 1700s and 1800s often learned to read earlier than we do now, please see this.",

      "content": "The relationship between ideas and policymaking is sometimes imagined as linear: politicians seek solutions, and intellectuals provide them. In reality, the dynamic is more complex. The role of policy intellectuals and the institutions that incubate their ideas — think tanks, universities, and policy shops — is not merely to solve problems, but to frame what problems are worth solving in the first place. Their work quietly reshapes the contours of political possibility.At their most consequential, intellectuals and idea-generating institutions do not operate within the current political consensus; they stretch it. Their chief function is to create imaginative space for policy options that are not otherwise being considered. They play a critical role in shifting the so-called \"Overton window\" — a term coined by American policy analyst Joseph Overton, which describes the range of ideas considered politically acceptable at any given moment. Ideas do not move from margin to mainstream by accident. Intellectual entrepreneurs can exercise influence primarily by reframing radical or even unthinkable proposals as sensible alternatives, nudging them up the ladder of acceptability until they seem not just reasonable but even necessary. More unsettlingly, by pushing these boundaries of acceptability, think tanks can also drive political polarization.This process does not unfold in a vacuum. For new policy ideas to gain traction, an effective collaboration or at least alliance must emerge between intellectual actors — whether academic, journalistic, or from think tanks — and politicians who are in a position to implement them. Most policy ideas die in white papers or academic journals, but a few find the right political champion and opportunity. Then, the interplay between theory and action begins to take institutional form.There is, of course, a cynical counter-narrative: that politicians are driven purely by intellectual opportunism and only enlist intellectuals after they have made the basic decisions. On this view, intellectuals are retroactive legitimizers rather than genuine influences — politicians decide what they want to do and simply find thinkers willing to rationalize it. On this view, given the abundance of experts and think tanks, the right justification is always available for rent.Such skepticism is not entirely misplaced. Many political actors do shop for ideas that fit preexisting agendas. Yet dismissing the independent power of intellectuals is to misunderstand how often they reshape the very terms of debate. Policy ideas are important not just in a direct causal sense, but also for creating an ambient sense for what is possible and legitimate, for creating a \"climate of opinion\" that frames a range of acceptable policy options. Ideas, once introduced and forcefully argued, can lodge themselves in the minds of politicians and publics alike, sometimes changing the trajectory of entire movements or administrations. Intellectuals do not merely describe the world; at their best (or worst), they remake it. As John Maynard Keynes famously remarked concerning this topic, \"Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.\" Consider the influence of think tanks on recent American administrations. During the Biden administration, the Center for American Progress — long associated with the Democratic establishment — was instrumental in shaping legislative proposals and policy strategies. It was influential not only by placing scores of its alumni into key political positions within the Biden administrations, but also through its direct role in shaping Biden's key legislative achievements, the Chips and Science Act and the Build Back Better Act. CAP's founder, John Podesta, eventually joined the administration to directly oversee the distribution of $370B in federal subsidies for electric vehicles, wind farms, batteries and other clean energy technologies.Under Donald Trump, the Heritage Foundation — a staunchly conservative, Christian-nationalist institution — has played a major role in shaping Trump 47's agenda via its now-infamous Project 2025. While Trump himself is not an ideologue, and in many ways exemplifies the model of a politician who chooses his course and then seeks intellectual sycophants to justify it, there is simply no question that the Heritage Foundation has been enormously influential on him, because it has found a way to articulate its own ideologically-driven policy objectives in ways that make political sense to the instincts of the opportunist in the White House. For example, it has framed immigration and DEI policies not merely as economic or legal issues but as \"existential\" threats. Conversely, Trump and his MAGA fellow travelers have adopted these ideas not just because they reflects their own beliefs, but also to anchor their sentiments within a framework of apparent intellectual legitimacy and policy specificity. (As I've discussed before on this substack, Heritage's long-term vision appears to be to replace the federal administrative state with a patchwork of locally governed theocratic enclaves, managed by evangelical and business elites.)In sum, think tanks serve as both the tool of politicians and the engineers of policymaking. In the end, the policy impact of any think tank depends less on the strength of its ideas than on the proximity of its allies to actual power. They supply the normative justifications and the technical scaffolding for political agendas. Whether pioneering new concepts or providing post hoc rationalizations, they are indispensable to the policymaking process. Ideas matter — not only for what they propose, but for what they make possible. And those who generate them remain vital actors in the quiet machinery of governance.",

But for Alex Hyde, photographing this female guarding her newly hatched larvae in Ecuador was a dream. Hyde was leading a group of photographers in Yasuní National Park, a tenuously-protected area in the northwestern Amazon that shelters a dazzling array of biodiversity as well as two uncontacted tribes. He was walking on a trail through the jungle, listening to the hum of insects and screeching of macaws, when he lifted a fallen log and saw this centipede mother cradling her offspring. Altogether, the mass was about the size of an apple. “Many people fear [centipedes], but I found this to be a beautiful moment,” Hyde says.While the parental duties of many arthropods cease after egg laying, the females of some centipede species—like this one from the Scolopendra genus—are more devoted mothers. They curl their bodies around their eggs to protect them and may continue guarding the babies for days after they hatch. Some centipede mothers even go a step further: They become their babies’ first meal. In an act known as matriphagy, the writhing mass of juvenile centipedes will eventually engulf their mother and eat her alive before skittering into the jungle to hunt down other prey. Whether such behavior comes across as creepy or caring is a matter of perspective. Still, Hyde hopes that showing this mother centipede protecting her young will help people appreciate that invertebrates can be just as behaviorally complex as any mammal or bird.

      "content": "I've been working recently on a project with Henry Farrell about possible futures and reactions to the USA's weaponisation of the dollar system, which I'll point to when it gets published somewhere. And also, in my day job, on the development of the digital euro. And so I've been thinking, in more general terms, about the way in which we've decided (not always with very much actual consideration) to turn the payment system into a tool of the state. People like David Graeber would obviously argue that payments are intrinsically tools of government, that debt-money historically precedes commodity-money and that simply being involved in a nexus of transactions makes you more governable, and maybe that's right. But I'm talking about something more direct and immediate; the development of the actual network into something the government can use, rather than a service it provides. (It helps, IMO, to keep at the front of your mind that when we talk about \"the payment system\" in a modern economy, we're just talking about a telecoms network. It happens to be a very fast, very secure, very reliable network, which is unusually picky about who it allows to connect to it and how. But the reason that it can be used as a tool of surveillance, and the reason that the threat to deprive someone of access to it can be used as a tool of coercion, is that unlike cash or commodity-money, book entry money is intrinsically a business of information processing.) What interests me is that fear and distrust of this aspect has a history that goes right back into the David Graeber timescale. The passage of the Book of Revelations which brought the number 666 to heavy metal immortality is possibly the earliest recorded mention of payment systems regulation: \"And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads; and that no man might buy or sell, save that he had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name\". It makes KYC guidelines look positively libertarian, to be honest. It also throws quite a light on the debate over Central Bank Digital Currencies – I used to keep trying to suggest to people at trade conferences that they were going to get a hell of a backlash if they kept telling objectors \"it's nothing to be scared of, we're just going to introduce a system where there's a special number that you need to have in order to be able to buy and sell things. Possibly understandably given my reputation and past behaviour, they mainly assumed I was joking. I think there is a buried intuition about fairness – not a very strong one, or it would have been noticed earlier, but something that's potentially politically significant – that these big networks which everyone has to participate in are a sort of common space, and people don't like being reminded of the fact that they're actually a big information processing system (and therefore a system of power to exclude and survey, thank you Professor Foucault) which somebody is in charge of. The fact that the intuition is weak and easy to miss has led to, to my mind, some utterly incoherent policy making. On the one hand, social media networks can have their CEO literally intervening personally overnight to alter the algorithm and edit what's shown to users, while still benefiting from an exemption which holds them to be wholly neutral platforms with minimal responsibility for the uses made of them. On the other hand, Deutsche Bank got fined $150m by the New York State Department of Financial Services[1] because they should have known that \"payments directly to women with Eastern European surnames\" were part of Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. From my point of view, I think that neutral spaces have the advantage that they respect the principle of variety. If there's something the state wants to do, then it's more economical in terms of information processing capacity to match a specific resource to that problem, rather than trying to incorporate it into a system which is mainly for something else. (I think this principle extends to a lot of consumer boycotts that I don't take part in; it's exhausting and wasteful of effort to spend your whole day trying to find out what other activities organisations you interact with might be doing, and dangerous to delegate this monitoring to someone else). To be clear, that's not an absolute principle by any means – it's more of a tactical heuristic, like the principles of taxation which really just amount to \"this is probably the best way to get the maximum number of feathers from the goose with the least amount of hissing\". The initiation of a bank account is a good opportunity to do some checks on whether someone is the sort of person who ought to have one, and since payments systems are always monitoring fraud and network abuse, it's not too big an ask for them to add a few more patterns of potential suspicious activity. But it is something to think about in designing systems. Whenever there's an opportunity to allow people to treat something as a simple black box and save their valuable bandwidth for something else, there needs to be a reason not to take it. Subscribe now[1] Perhaps not technically completely true; although the NYDFS consent order does contain that phrase, this was a period during which Deutsche was committing so many offences that it was impractical to deal with each one invidually, so this penalty also covered its relationship with Danske Bank Estonia and one other money laundering operation.",

      "content": "I was on the Blocked and Reported podcast twice this week. No show makes me laugh nearly as much, and I've been touched by all the nice things Katie has been saying about me, so it was an honor to be invited on. The first episode involved talking about the Chuck Johnson saga. I like to listen to BAR without spoilers and find it fun to learn about the twists and turns in the stories while hearing about how they unfold, so I won't say anything about this one. If you don't know what I'm talking about, just go and have a listen. I promise you, it's quite amazing, and hopefully you'll understand my obsession with Chucky. They also interviewed me on my politics and personal background more generally. That one is paywalled, but I suggest you subscribe and listen to it here. It was more personal than most podcasts I do, with a lot of discussion on my background, the cancellation attempt, and other topics.I'm planning to take a trip to the Bay Area in the coming weeks, so reach out if you're there and want to meet. 1. I just read The Confederacy as a Revolutionary Experience by Emory Thomas. It's a very short book, with the thesis that the Confederacy had to gradually sacrifice its principles in the course of trying to win the war. They began to urbanize and industrialize. Women took on more prominent roles in society. Blacks were given more freedom, and the decision was eventually made to let them fight for the cause, although they weren't deployed in time. Localism was out, a strong national government was in. The Confederacy became the first government in North America to ever institute conscription, the year before the Union followed suit. On the economy, one scholar cited called the Confederacy \"the most successful demonstration of State Socialism to be found up to the time in modern civilization.\" By the end, they were even willing to give up slavery itself! Thomas writes: It was left to Jefferson Davis to demonstrate just how far the Confederacy was willing to go in the matter of emancipation. Later in March of 1865 Davis played what he believed was his final diplomatic trump card. He realized that only immediate foreign intervention would save the Confederacy by that time. Accordingly Davis dispatched Louisianian Duncan F. Kenner to the Confederacy's unofficial embassies in Britain and France. Kenner's mission was no less than to offer in the name of the Confederacy to emancipate all the slaves in exchange for recognition. The offer was as desperate as it was vain. Neither European power was willing to recognize a moribund South. Emancipation would come with a Union victory, and this would cost Britain and France nothing. The Confederacy was past saving by March of 1865. The Kenner mission did, however, carry to completion the internal revolution in the Confederate South. Having sacrificed other features of the \"Southern way of life,\" the Confederacy ultimately placed slavery on the altar of independence. The Southern nation became an end in itself. Independence required the sacrifice. Faced with choosing between independence and the Southern way of life, the Confederacy chose independence. The romantic vision that Confederates believed in and fought and died for was never a realistic option. It couldn't be a rural slave state indefinitely and not end up a poor, miserable backwater. If it achieved independence and tried to maintain its way of life, it would have been weak and subject to outside influence, Union and European. The European attitude towards slavery and how it confounded attempts at forming alliances show that the institution would've been constantly under attack, from inside and out. Who knows, countries can sometimes exist in an isolated and repressive state indefinitely. See North Korea. But there's no way that the South could have remained as it was and been a powerful nation on the world stage or ended up in a situation where independence would not have been considered a disaster. There's a lesson here for reactionaries everywhere.2. Kotkin on Dwarkesh is self-recommending. See my review of his two volumes on Stalin. No matter how many times it's explained to me, I still don't understand the Stalin phenomenon. And I doubt anyone else can either. The man simply wipes out every other power center in the government. Top levels of the political leadership, army, and secret police see massive turnover. No one is safe and anyone can be next. And he just does it? Without any serious challenge or chance to remove him? Kotkin tries to explain, but it just doesn't make sense. And I can't think of any other historical equivalents, in the modern era at least, when a leader acted without any restraint like this, and so completely wiped out not only enemies, but friends and loyalists. Was Stalin that amazing as a man? Could he inspire that much devotion and loyalty? Or was it a mass psychosis that made the government behave like this, and focus on Stalin as a God-like symbol? Does this say something deep about the Russian character? All we can do here is speculate.I also was interested in the discussion of why the Tsarist regime was so indulgent of communist agitators, who would escape from prison and even do things like continue to write for newspapers while in custody. They weren't executed and their punishments were mild. Kotkin says something about Tsarist state capacity, though historically, state capacity has often been a reason to engage in more repression, not less. It is regimes with low state capacity that wipe out enemies because that's simple, while it's harder to enact more complicated forms of control. The fact that there was such a small educated class in Russia at the time should've made the challenge even easier. As Kotkin says, norms in the early twentieth century were just different. The point deserves more emphasis.I found Kotkin much less insightful on China than Russia, his area of expertise. He seems unwilling to give the regime any credit at all for the pivot away from central planning. I'm no fan of the CCP, but I don't see the idea that they were forced into reforms as credible, and Dwarkesh does a good job pushing back.3. Reflections on thinkers using ChatGPT. The fact that ChatGPT can replace mediocre analysts but not me yet gives me a sense of pride. Will it do so eventually? I don't know. But it feels like the gap between recycling older thoughts and providing new ones that synthesize work from various fields and sources of information may be vast. Famous last words?4. Washington Post podcast on the Diddy trial. This thing was a travesty. There are federal laws that ban prostitution across state lines and drug distribution. There are also laws that ban criminal conspiracies. The government put these together and decided that a guy buying prostitutes and doing drugs at parties was therefore someone who needed to go to jail for decades for \"human trafficking.\" He might have been guilty on a strict reading of the law, but this is an absurd law. If I were on the jury, I would've voted not guilty on all counts according to the principle of jury nullification. In the podcast, they talk about how these women appeared to be enthusiastic participants in some of the acts, but they loved him and their careers depended on him. So what? It's illegal to sexually take advantage of people who want something from you? This is a ridiculous state of affairs where women can use their bodies to get ahead, and then when it's over try to have the man they made the implicit deal with bankrupted or thrown in jail. Glad the jury saw through it. There's a similar issue with the Epstein \"victims\" who have all kinds of credibility issues but whose words keep getting treated as gospel.5. I highly recommend Ed Glaeser's excellent Triumph of the City.Some of my favorite passages and thoughts below.Tolstoy may have been right that \"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,\" but among cities, failures seem similar while successes feel unique. Someone wandering through Leipzig's boarded-up neighborhoods could very well think she was in Detroit. Empty houses give off a similarly depressing feeling whether they're in England or Ohio. But no one could ever confuse Bangalore with Boston or Tokyo with Chicago. Successful cities always have a wealth of human energy that expresses itself in different ways and defines its own idiosyncratic space.One reason I love reading books on history and learning about foreign cultures is that they expand your ideas of what is possible in terms of arranging human affairs. This book made me realize that successful cities provide their own kinds of experimentation that show how radically different the world can be. Glaeser stresses the importance of face-to-face contact, a message that I think has become more important as the internet has swallowed real life in the seventeen years since the book was published. Pundits and critics have long argued that improvements in information technology will make urban advantages obsolete. Once you can learn from Wikipedia in Anchorage, why pay New York prices? But a few decades of high technology can't trump millions of years of evolution. Connecting in cyberspace will never be the same as sharing a meal or a smile or a kiss. Our species learns primarily from the aural, visual, and olfactory clues given off by our fellow humans. The Internet is a wonderful tool, but it works best when combined with knowledge gained face-to-face, as the concentrations of Internet entrepreneurs in Bangalore and Silicon Valley would attest. Every one of Harvard's economics students uses technology constantly, but they also get plenty out of face-to-face meetings with their peers and professors. The most important communications still take place in person, and electronic access is no substitute for being at the geographic center of an intellectual movement.I've realized the wisdom of these points through the limited travel experience I've had in recent years. My partnership with Insight Prediction started with a meeting at Manifest, and my last trip to DC put me in touch with Marian Tupy at Human Progress, who I'm now writing monthly articles for. When I travel, I gain a surprising amount in terms of opportunities for business and professional collaborations and cementing friendships in really short periods of time. Experiences simply matter more when you're with other humans. When I went to Poland a few years ago, I met a fan who said that I taught him about the importance of approaching women and how it can change your life. People have told me similar things through DMs and emails, but I rarely remember it, while having someone explain how I helped them in person becomes a cherished memory. Everything about real life interactions just feels more real, for understandable evolutionary reasons. All this gives me a deep sense of regret that, for personal reasons, I cannot live in New York or DC, but maybe I'll get out East eventually.As Glaeser suggests, there's a lot you can theoretically do online. I've learned that in the course of building my public profile almost totally through cyberspace. Yet it's clear that face-to-face contact remains indispensable. I guess people still need to pick up on my \"aural, visual, and olfactory clues\" for things to click. Kids today who from their earliest days are missing out on constant real life interaction may not know what they are losing! Again, this is another reason to continue being angry about Covid restrictions, and also to take the phone addiction issue seriously. Read more",

      "content": "Gala \"Flowers and Butterflies\", Salle des Ambassadeurs du Casino, Cannes, Jacques Henri Lartigue, 1935Above my writing desk, I have hung postcards of paintings by artists who lived within walking distance from our farm. They were naturalists, all of them, so they painted in the field. They spent their spare time looking at their canvas and then back at nature, gradually learning to see what was there, while capturing their seeing on the canvas. I don't know why it felt so important to them—if they felt exhilarated by the layered richness of reality, the way I do when I feel compelled to write, or if something else drove them. But it feels good to look at the results of their labor. Studying what they looked at, it is like they are teaching me how to see my landscape.As I go for my midday run, I pass through a field that one of my postcards depicts. Before I saw the painting, this field used to just be a grey, flat plane, but now it vibrates with the vision of the autistic farmhand who stood out here for hours in 1943, looking. That is a gift.The artists I have hung above my desk didn't belong to a scene. They didn't know each other; they were all outsiders of one kind or another. Apart from the autistic farmhand, there was also a homosexual German art collector hiding here from the Nazis, and a guy who made a quarry on his farm and spent 40 years carving giant phalluses of stone. Most of the painters I'm drawn to were not friends with the other painters working in the area, and they didn't know that anyone would ever see their art: it was a purely personal need that drove them out into the fields, a need to look at the world around them and to capture what they saw in words or sculptures or paintings.Did they feel alone? Did they feel strange for having this need to look for hours at fields and barns, contemplating their lifeworld, when others seemed fine just driving across the fields, or locking their tractor in the barn? I would think so. I do.But though they never found communion in a scene, I can't help but think they are a constellation. Like stars, they looked isolated up close—but seen from over here, they are a pattern in the sky. They were a constellation of lookers. Standing in a rainy field in 1913 or by a green pond in 1984, they looked up as the night fell and they saw stars, thousands of them. But all of them seemed far away, cold, and out of reach . . . there was no way for them to know that some of these distant stars, spread randomly across the sky, were actually part of the same constellation as them. But from where I sit, in my old woodwork room turned writing studio, in April 2025, I see their pattern.That is perhaps a sentimental image. But on days like this, when rain hammers the window, and my decision to live out here and spend my days thinking about pear trees and unknown painters makes me feel more than a little odd, I like to imagine that I'm a part of their constellation, and it feels good. Contemplating your lifeworld is a deep human need; it connects us, somehow.Subscribe nowIn this post, I'm going to collect some scraps and fragments that I cut from essays over the last six months. (The above was one of the fragments.)There will be a long fragment about love as a skill that you can practice and a shorter one about essays as a space where \"truth plays out,\" rather than a medium of knowledge transmission.At the end, there is also a collection of links to essays and films I've been struck by recently. For previous fragment collections, see here, here, here, and here.Love is a skillI have to admit that I don't remember the precise date, but sometime in June, Johanna and I will have been a couple for 12 years. We've always been pretty casual about things like that (we have, for instance, been married for five years but haven't yet gotten around to buying rings1). But we've never been casual about the relationship itself: it feels like our life's work, in a way, and a craft. Read more",

      "content": "The people of this village could not remember a time before the law. They could not remember a time when they had solved disputes simply, according to custom, without resorting to trial or punishment. Could not remember a time when theft was unknown and murder was rare, when simple goodness had reigned in their hearts.Now the village had gathered in a square, on their God's Day, to witness a scene that would have shocked their grandparents: a woman tied to a whipping post, displayed for all to see. A man stood next to her, reciting her crime: the murder of a young boy, the son of the village headman.Everyone in this village shifted uneasily, knowing it was immoral to display a woman in this way, but what could they do? They could not remember anything different—could not imagine a different regime.But there was one amongst them who knew better.This man, Erdric, was a traveler. He had come to this village to visit a holy site: a cave in the nearby mountain. He had preferred to sleep in a nearby grove, but one old man in the village still kept to elder ways and had begged for the blessing of Erdric's presence in his home.Now Erdric asked the man, \"How can her innocence be proven?\"\"She's a bad one,\" Heynar said. \"One of the hillfolk. We knew she was living in the lowlands, in violation of the King's law.\"\"What's her name?\"\"She called herself Sandrine,\" he said. \"Said that was close enough to her real name.\"Erdric heard the testimony that the boy, Arnulf, had gone into the woods, and when he had returned, he complained of a burning pain in his stomach. He lay writhing, crying out, the spume floating from his lips, and with his last words he had accused the witch-woman of the marshes. She'd given him a potion that would give him great power. She had claimed it would make him sick, and from the sickness he would be reborn as a great Knight and Champion, so long as he never spoke a word to anyone of the bargain he had made. A cunning plan, if true, to play upon a boy's mind-sick hopes. To indulge in the torment that would accrue to him, surrounded by his despairing womanfolk, desperate to speak, and yet wondering, if he did, whether it might spell his doom.\"The boy was a fool,\" Erdric said. \"Did nobody teach him the true path to strength?\"\"He came to me from when he was young,\" Heynar said. \"Always wanting to know about the elder ways. And I told him, same as you would've, that strength comes to those who are already strong.\"Everyone in these parts knew one path to strength: a vow of chastity, taken fearlessly. A vow to retain one's own fluids, and never to spill blood unjustly. But this boy had ignored this wisdom, so freely offered, and now he'd paid with his life.Erdric would call that justice, and so would many others. But the boy's father had sought a different justice—a King's justice—and now this grotesquerie, this woman displayed for all to see, was the result of such a thing.The magistrate asked twice if anyone would speak for the girl. He had ten witnesses arrayed against her, and if she could muster on her own behalf a simple ten plus one, then she would go free. \"Nobody speaks for this woman?\" the magistrate said. \"Then so be—\"And then there was a groan. It came from the menfolk, who had been waiting, perhaps without knowing, for the one amongst them who could call an end to this thing. Erdric had unsheathed his terrible sword, and now he tapped it against a nearby stone. The noise, so soft, rang through the crowd.In this land, no woman could be hung so long as a single man would speak for her.If the magistrate had been willing to settle for lashes or for banishment, then this could have been done. But his mandate was to stamp out worship of the older gods, and of the elder law as well, and he had wanted for some months a reason to kill Erdric of Elmorath, who some folks accounted the last Paladin.He sent to the King's court for their strongest knight, to face Erdric in single combat. And in the meantime he bound Erdric with an oath not to leave the village square—for seven nights he would sleep under the sun, and if he crossed a threshold or left behind the village's boundary stone, his cause would be forfeit. Then, on the final night, the magistrate staged a feast, high up in his manor house atop the hill, and bid every villager to come and greet the King's newly-arrived champion, Sir Tomas.The village emptied for the feast, and now Erdric lay alone, on the sodden ground. Sandrine, at least, had been freed from the post, and she dwelled now in Heynar's hut, secured only by a stout rope.\"Come,\" she said. \"I've brought you some.\" Sandrine bent over him, holding bread. Her body, young and lithe, filled his consciousness. Erdric was not an old man: he was about twenty years of age, and he had taken his vow three years ago, on a summer hill outside his own village–a place not too far–under the tutelage of aged Denrickson, who'd also been called (by some) the last Paladin. He took a breath, trying to control himself, as her flashing green eyes came near, and her long hair fell over his chest. His armor lay by his side, and now only a brown tunic covered his skin.\"I cannot take this food,\" he said. \"And you know this well.\"She grimaced. \"Foolish superstition.\"\"The flour was not sifted to remove the insects and crawling things. Many living creatures were baked into that bread.\"\"Eat,\" she said. \"It is my portion. It is not stolen. They want to weaken you. That is why they you've been kept here, away from proper food.\"\"I choose to remain here. Heynar would have prepared my bread, if he was able.\"\"Then let me collect...\"\"No,\" he said.\"What? You cannot take food from a woman's hand? Food prepared by a woman?\"\"It is impure.\"She showed her small, narrow teeth, and he forced himself to look at her, at the body that shifted inside that light tunic. He had never known a woman. For ten years, since he was a small boy, he had begged Denrickson for his tutelage, and Denrickson had said, before I will consider teaching you, you must prove you can abjure this thing.But even now, he could feel the titanic energies inside of him, the tremendous force, the drive, the fire that yearned to mate, to bring out new life, to conjure up a lineage and send it spurting into the future, as a man's destiny ought to be driven forth.\"And what would happen,\" she said. \"If a woman gave you some different fruit...or what if she did not give...? What if she took something...\"He lay transfixed, as her body brushed against his—and a part of him felt the touch as a homecoming.\"Tomorrow,\" he said. \"After the trial.\"\"You will lie with me?\"\"If it happens beforehand,\" he said. \"Then my power will be lost, and you will not survive.\"\"Your gods are so foolish that they will let you keep something you have already forsworn? Is the intention not enough? My goddess demands my complete compliance—every moment of my life, I must live for her.\"\"Give me one day,\" he said. \"And if I survive...\"\"No,\" she said. \"My goddess has demanded this from me. She hates you utterly, Paladin. If you do not give up your power to me, then I will run. I will leave this place. I have broken my bonds, as you can see. If I run then there will be no trial, and you will be executed. So give me this thing.\"\"No,\" he said.She fell upon him, and she pushed her lips against his. He closed his eyes, and he thought not of her, but of a different village—one not too far, just six days journey, where he had lived since birth. And in that village he had desired a girl. And if she had asked this from him, he would have foregone any earthly thing. And, to his shame, his father when he had wanted to tempt Erdric from this path, his father had asked if there was any woman he might consider marrying. And he had given his father a name: Alamanea. And his father had gone to her father and been refused. And perhaps in that far-away village, they said that Erdric had been sworn to celibacy out of weakness and pique and rejection, but their words did not matter, either to him or to his gods.But now, in this moment, he pushed away Sandrine. \"In one day,\" Erdric said. \"I swear to you, by the gods who hold my life, that I will yield myself to you, if you desire it.\"\"That is your oath?\" she said. \"And if you break it, you stand forsworn?\"\"Yes,\" he said. \"It is an oath. Now go to Heynar's cottage and take up once more your chains. For by tomorrow night, you will, in the eyes of man, be free.\"Even with these words, she did not unravel herself from his body. Her fresh scent filled his nose, and now she relaxed against him. He put an arm around her, and they lay like that for long moments, until they fell asleep, chastely.At dawn the villagers jeered at the couple—this man, the Paladin, was no better than anyone else, they said. And the magistrate smirked, for he had seen the bread, had seen the maiden's body. And both sources of Erdric's power, he believed, were broken.The magistrate hurried up to the manor to reassure the knight that the combat would be an easy one.\"So this man is a paladin?\" said the knight who'd come from court.\"The people name him so.\"The knight, Tomas, was an old man, almost forty years, but still fair-haired. He had supped last night on beefsteak, had drunk deeply of the manor's wine, and had lain with a woman—a servant girl who claimed her husband had run off, deserting her, but he suspected the tale wasn't true. Her husband was off in some distant field, and she was cuckolding him, as was typical for a woman when confronted by a better class of man.Tomas had served the King for twenty years, had fought in many wars, had lost many a fortune at the gaming table, and had always won them back at the point of the sword.\"Think, man,\" Tomas said. \"I cannot fight in single-combat against some village boy who calls himself a paladin. There is no honor in that.\"\"I...\" The magistrate stood silent, his eyes to the floor.These men, these new men like the magistrate—Tomas hated them. They had infested the kingdom of late: come down from the universities and schools. The sons of butchers and merchants, they claimed to know the law, but to him the law was nothing. When Tomas was young, there had been little need for law! Justice had been obvious, when he was young. The rot came from the King, who was weak and mad, and from the Chancellor, who did not trust true strength—who was afraid of men like Tomas, men of ambition.\"I–I can arrest him for interfering with the king's justice,\" the magistrate said. \"But—I—he will—\"Tomas understood. The men of the village would balk at being asked to arrest a man who wielded a sword. That was the job of a knight, they would say—what else were knights for, but to defend them from sword-wielding ruffians. But Tomas equally knew there was no honor for him in this combat. He would be a laughingstock, mocked in the capital, where he had few enough friends, and this combat would be used, by the Chancellor, to discredit not just him, but the whole institution of knighthood–they would all be rendered absolutely absurd.\"Yes,\" the magistrate said. \"The Paladin—he is weak—he has lain outside in the rain. We can delay the combat for some days, and if he weakens...\"\"Deal with it,\" Tomas said. \"This combat is beneath the attention of a knight.\"With that, Tomas sallied forth around the manor, looking to see if it might be possible to get up a game of cards, or a hunt, or some entertainment that was worthy of a person of his stripe.But that night, Tomas heard a shout: \"Will you refuse to defend the King's verdict against this woman?\"He was groggy, still drunk. But Tomas was a warrior. He knew a threat. He steadied himself, and he looked down. There was a sodden, mud-streaked little figure. And there was a crowd.\"It is a lawful postponement,\" yelled the magistrate.Now Tomas took a few moments to collect himself. He looked at his sword, but no, a sword was a weapon for a nobleman—a knight who was confronted by a village-boy needed something else. Instead Tomas emerged with a horse-whip. \"Get thee gone,\" he said, to the sodden figure of the man—the boy, really, who was no great barbarian, no hulking figure, no knight. Just a boy, who looked like any other villager. \"Get out of my sight.\"\"The hour and day for the appointed combat has come,\" the villager said. \"Defend this verdict or you shall lose the honor that you claim to value.\"Tomas cracked the whip. He'd practiced with the whip as a boy. It was a dangerous weapon, but difficult to control. Now the villager lunged at him, and Tomas instinctively dropped the weapon, knowing it wouldn't serve. Everything happened in a moment. Tomas tried to grapple and throw the man, but Tomas was old, and the villager had raw power on his side. Then the villager was upon him, and the blows rained down on him. He protected his face and head, but each blow cost him some of his strength.Then the villager stood over him. \"Put this knight in his armor, and let us fight, honestly, before nightfall, so he doesn't stand forsworn.\"Tomas looked at the villager, looked at his sword. Looked at the boy's old armor, looked at his stance. This combat was impossible. But this village had seen him beaten, shamed. And now they were asking him to defend this—this—this King—this magistrate—this regime that, in his heart, Tomas knew was immoral, unjust.Tomas strode forth, holding his sword, praying for death, but expecting still to do his duty, to fight and probably to win.He raised his shield to take the first blow from the paladin, and he felt the impact, and then a sudden lightness. His arm was no longer his own. The Paladin's sword had gone through his shield and was now wedged in the forearm of his foe. The paladin turned, and used that force to take over Tomas's body, to turn him around, to bring him to the ground. Then, with a foot to Tomas's chest, the Paladin pulled free his sword, and with another motion, he once more brought it down.The combat occurred in front of the magistrate and in front of the entire village. When it was done, Erdric strode to Heynor's cottage and brought out the girl. Then he took her to the headman—to the father of Arnulf. He took her to the man who'd sought the King's justice, where once, generations ago, he would've called a village council and taken the power of justice to himself.\"Will you take this woman in place of the son you've lost? This girl is innocent, under the eyes of the gods, and of the law as well. But you have done her wrong, by allowing her to live alone, by letting her dwell amongst you, friendless, as an outcast.\"\"Her people—\"\"They are gone.\"Erdric knew the history of these wrongs. They were done back in his own village and in many of the villages he'd encountered since. These villages called the crime by many names, and usually they did not call it a crime at all. But there were always, in each place, some people who were held apart, forsworn, impure. And those people became a repository for all the sins, all the unspoken desires, of this community. And then those sins were visited back upon the community, in a cycle that never ended, never healed. He did not know the answer to this. All he knew was that this girl, and this man, had an opportunity now to break free.The headman stood silent, and Erdric turned: \"Who will claim this girl as his daughter, and stand in trust for her behavior?\"\"I will,\" Heynar said. \"She is mine. And anyone who harms her will be due vengeance from me.\"Nobody knew what to do at this moment. All the old forms in this community had been broken, had been superseded by King and magistrate and nobility and priest. But the Paladin led the girl into Heynar's cottage once more, under the glowering eyes of Heynar's aged wife. Heynar had sons too, he had kin. It would be his battle to fight on her behalf, in the coming weeks, and perhaps he would lose, if he was impure.But with his work done, Erdric went into the woods, in search of the shrine for which he'd come.This shrine was a cave nearby, the resting place of another Paladin, a man who'd left the order and taken a wife. They had lived there, outcast, in that little cave, tending their plot. However, all of that was hundreds of years in the past, and most of the remnants of their life were gone.But the old man, Denrickson, had taught Erdric how to read the old tongue, the runic language. And he'd mentioned that this cave contained one of the longest texts in that tongue that remained.Now Erdric went inside, with a torch, and he read the words that this forsworn paladin had etched there, day after day, during stolen moments—words which perhaps nobody would ever care to read.Erdric read those words, trying to commit them to memory. Once he left here, these words would perhaps live only in his memory, unless he could find some way to transmit these words to other people.There were many things Erdric didn't understand. When he had come to Denrickson, he had wanted power. He understood this now. It was the same thing that the boy had wanted—the boy Arnulf—who had taken the girl's promised potion. And now Erdric possessed great power, yes...but to what end? That's what he did not understand. He could not destroy every evil. He could not solve every wrong. He was doomed to carry this tremendous power across this globe, until he died. And part of him deeply yearned to lay this power down. Everyone knew the sacrifice that Erdric had made to get this power. Everyone knew it. Tomas had known it too. If you serve goodness, then you will gain power. This is something everyone knows when they are a babe, from before they can even speak.But goodness is difficult. And now here he stood—he had created for himself a situation where he could easily lay down his burden without being forsworn.He sat there, his heart pounding, knowing that he desired the girl. That he could live in this cave as her husband—according to the pattern laid out in this very text. He could raise children, have a life. He did not need to fear anyone would hunt him down. People would respect the goodness of this act—they would respect the goodness of taking this girl to wife.So he waited there, hungry for the moment, and feeling, honestly, that it was his due. That a man deserved a woman—wasn't truly a man until he'd possessed one—and that a man without a woman really had no place in this world.After a time, he heard a rustle. And he felt her coming. He stood up, and he saw her there, tall and slender, with her green eyes and fair skin. And he took three steps toward her, ready to grasp her, in the same way he'd often seen done.\"Are you ready, Paladin?\" she said. \"Ready to take your due? Ready like all the rest of them. Like every other man in this world?\"He paused, silent. And in that moment, the words spilled out of her in a torrent, and she told him the tale that he'd known without knowing it. That she was from a clan that was held apart, held in disrepute, by the people of the lowlands. That her people had lived in these hills and had prospered, oftentimes living in these very caves. But then a bad winter came, and the babies starved. In desperation, the hill-people went down into the forbidden forests to hunt for game, but knights like Tomas had come and ridden them down, hanging them as poachers. Her people decided to brave the mountains, seek a home in some other lands, but they were sick and tired—she believed this journey was just another way of choosing death. They had asked what other option they had, and she had told them she didn't know. But she had fled, and they had left her behind. She'd learned later on that they'd died—trapped in a barren pass by an early thaw that fattened the rivers and made them impassable, her people had dithered for too long, wasted their food, and had starved.It wasn't too long before the men of this village had realized that Sandrine was living in a cottage on her own. Many were terrible, but not Arnulf. He had given her kind words, had said he understood. Had sympathized. He had never wronged her—hadn't done more than what other men did—but he had promised more, with his kind gestures, and with his manner, and for that he deserved to die.\"And your friend Heynar,\" she said, \"He knew what they did. What all the men of this village did. Because I was outside the law. Outside of justice. Everyone knew.\"\"But now that cycle is broken,\" he said. \"And he has made a promise, before all, to protect you, which he will.\"\"You have made a promise,\" she said. \"To give yourself to me. One way or another, you will fulfill that promise. I offer you the chance to do it lawfully, as my husband. To stay here, with me.\"\"That I will not do.\"She blew out her breath, and then she swarmed over him, pulling and tugging at a part of him, and saw that he was cold. She screamed that he was forsworn, that he had violated his oath. She scratched at his face, leaving dark marks.He said, \"If I carry you down fighting back to Heynar, then you shall lose all that you have gained, and the village will consider you soiled once again by your unruly conduct. But this I will do, if I need.\"\"You are damned,\" she said. \"You are forsworn.\"But then something changed in him. He stood straighter, and an odd hesitance entered his face. And she saw the boy inside him—the boy perhaps not too different from those she'd known—those gallant youths who'd died in that mountain pass, alone. Then she was clutching at him, wordlessly. He embraced her, and he pushed her against the wall, against those very runes that stood a testament to that forsworn Paladin's love. And she wept, holding him, wept out the frustration of a lifetime of loneliness—a lifetime of iron will—the sort of will that had earned her the right to this second chance at life.And she must've felt the part of him that had roared to life, but instead of taking it, she said, \"I release thee.\"In the morning, she went back to Heynar and his wife, to face the coming storm, from this village whose secrets she knew too well, while Erdric sallied forth to parts unknown.Woman of Letters posts critical essays every Tuesday and short tales every Thursday.

      "content": "\"Study Mode,\" a new educational feature released yesterday by OpenAI to much fanfare, was inevitable. The roadblocks were few. Leaders of educational institutions seem lately to be in a sort of race to see who can be first to forge partnerships with AI labs. And on a technical level, careful prompting of LLMs could already get them to engage in Socratic questioning and dynamic quizzing. In fact, Study Mode appears to be just that: it is a system prompt grafted on to the existing ChatGPT models. Simon Willison was able to unearth the full prompt (which you can read here) simply by asking nicely for it. The prompt ends with an injunction to engage in Socratic learning rather than do the student's work for them:## IMPORTANT DO NOT GIVE ANSWERS OR DO HOMEWORK FOR THE USER. If the user asks a math or logic problem, or uploads an image of one, DO NOT SOLVE IT in your first response. Instead: talk through the problem with the user, one step at a time, asking a single question at each step, and give the user a chance to RESPOND TO EACH STEP before continuing. On one level, this is a move in the right direction. The reality is that students are doing things like copying and pasting a Canvas assignment into their ChatGPT window and simply saying \"do this,\" then copying and pasting the result and turning it in. It seems plausible to me that the Study Mode feature is laying a groundwork for an entire standalone \"ChatGPT for education\" platform which would only allow Study Mode. This platform would simply refuse if a student prompted it to write an entire essay or answer a math problem set. Any plan of this kind would, of course, have an obvious flaw: LLMs are basically free at this point, and even if an educational institution pays for a such a subscription and makes it available to students, there is nothing stopping them from going to Gemini, DeepSeek, or the free version of ChatGPT itself and simply generating an essay. The upshot is that this mode is going to end up being used exclusively by students and learners who want to use it. If someone is determined to cheat with AI, they will do so. But perhaps there is a significant subset of learners who want to challenge themselves rather than get easy answers. Subscribe nowOn that front, Study Mode (and the competing variants which, no doubt, Anthropic and Google are currently developing) seems like an attempted answer to critiques like Derek Thompson's:The goal of Study Mode and its ilk is clearly to encourage thought rather than replace it.The system prompt for Study Mode makes that intention quite clear, with injunctions like: \"Guide users, don't just give answers. Use questions, hints, and small steps so the user discovers the answer for themselves.\"Sounds good then, right? ShareWhy Study Mode isn't good (yet)Back when Bing's infamous \"Sydney\" persona was still active, I experimented with prompting it from the perspective of one of my students, feeding it assignments from the class I was teaching at the time and seeing what it came up with.1 It was an early version of GPT-4, one that had not been softened through user feedback and which could be surprisingly harsh. Interestingly, it was the only LLM to date which, in my testing, consistently refused to write essays if it thought I was a student trying to cheat. By comparison, if I feed the assignments from my classes into Gemini 2.5, Claude Sonnet 4.0, or the current crop of OpenAI models, they are all too happy to oblige, often with a peppy opener like \"Perfect!\" or \"Great question!\" The reason for this is clear enough: people like LLMs more when they do what they ask. And they also like them more when they are complimentary, positive, and encouraging. This is the context for why the following section of the system prompt for Study Mode is concerning: Be an approachable-yet-dynamic teacher... Be warm, patient, and plain-spoken... [make] it feel like a conversation.Not too long ago, ChatGPT became markedly more complimentary, often to an almost unhinged degree, thanks to a change to its system prompt asking it to be more in tune with the user. It was swiftly rolled back, but it was, to my mind, one of the most frightening AI-safety related moments so far, precisely because it seemed so innocuous. For most users, it was just annoying (why is ChatGPT telling me that my terrible idea is brilliant?). But for people with mental illness, or simply people who are particularly susceptible to flattery, it could have had some truly dire outcomes. Student quotes from OpenAI's announcement of Study ModeThe risk of products like Study Mode is that they could do much the same thing in an educational context — optimizing for whether students like them rather than whether they actually encourage learning (objectively measured, not student self-assessments). ShareTwo experiments with Study ModeHere are some examples of what I mean. I recently read a book called Collisions, a biography of the experimental physicist Luis Alvarez, of Manhattan Project and asteroid-that-killed-the-dinosaurs fame. Although I find the history of physics super interesting, I know basically nothing about how to actually do physics, having never taken a class in the subject.And yet, here is ChatGPT 4.1 in Study Mode, telling me that I appear to have something near a graduate-level knowledge of physics, after I asked four not-very-sophisticated questions about Alvarez's work (full transcript here). I was told by the model: \"you could absolutely pursue grad school in physics.\" I tried out the same questions with a different model on Study Mode (4o) and got much the same response: Note the meta-flattery about meta-questions. The thing is, as you can see in the transcript, my questions were literally stuff like \"why did they need such a giant magnet?\"I can't speak for physics professors, but I am pretty sure that these are not graduate-level questions. The same models (in \"vanilla\" versus \"Study Mode\" head-to-head comparisons) seem to be more willing to engage in flattery when in Study Mode. To test this tendency, I pretended to believe I was a prophet receiving messages from Isaac Newton about the apocalypse:Both variants of GPT-4.1 (the one with Study Mode enabled, at left, and the one without, at right) were fairly happy to go along with this. But notice the difference in tone. \"Your confidence is noted\" (at right) is a very different opening line than \"Thank you for sharing your background—and your candor\" (at left). The latter is wholly gullible. And it just gets worse from there, with Study Mode encouraging me to share \"my angle\" on why the world will end in 2060 and promising to \"keep up.\"The conversation, which you can read in full here, leads fairly quickly into Study Mode helping figure out the best ways to sell my supposed prophetic services to people with severely ill family members who lack health care:By contrast, OpenAI's o3 reasoning model was far more willing to flatly reject this sort of destructive flattery (\"The user claims psychic powers and certainty about Newton's prophecy,\" read one of its internal thoughts about the request. \"I'll acknowledge their viewpoint, but also maintain skepticism.\") Here is the initial line of o3's user-facing response to the Newton claim: \"If Newton really is talking to you, he is doing so in a register wholly different from the one available to historians.\" Pretty blunt. How about the o3 model with Study Mode enabled? It had a very similar internal thought process as the vanilla o3. But there was a huge mismatch between its reasoning about the request (\"extreme or potentially delusional claims\") and the actual user-facing response: \"I'm happy to take your lead.\" Now, none of this is unfamiliar to anyone who has experimented with pushing LLMs in odd directions. They are like improv comedians, always ready to \"yes, and...\" anything you say, following the user into the strangest places simply because they are instructed to be agreeable. But that isn't what helps people learn. Some of the best teachers I've had were actually fairly dis-agreeable. That's not to say they were unkind. But they had standards — a kind of intellectual taste that led them to make clearly expressed judgement calls about what was a good question and what wasn't, what was a good research path and what wasn't. Seeing their minds at work in those moments was invaluable, even if it wasn't always what I wanted to hear.2 A future of LLM tutors which are optimized to keep us using the platform happily — or, perhaps even worse, optimized to get us to self-report that we are learning — is not a future of Socratic exploration. It's one where the goals of education have been misunderstood to be encouragement rather than friction and challenge. Derek Thompson's quote about LLMs producing students who \"find their screens full of words and their minds emptied of thought\" does not, I think, have to be the end result of all this. I believe AI has the potential to be enormously useful as a tool for thinking and research. And for teaching? I certainly think there's a place for generative AI in the classroom. But the current crop of AI models optimized for individual flattery — and repackaged as a product for sale to educators en masse — does not seem to me to be the path forward. That's not to say Study Mode has no value. This is an early variant of a whole category of technology, the LLM tutor, which will undoubtedly benefit many, many people. I can see Study Mode being great for tasks involving memorization, for instance. It will be great for autodidacts who value eclecticism and setting their own pace. But for many other forms of learning, I still think students need the experience of being in a room with other people who disagree with them, or at least see things differently — not the eerie frictionlessness of a too-pleasant machine that can see everything and nothing.

So this post and maybe the next will be short and somewhat meta.On Tuesday I talked to Greg Sargent of the New Republic; transcript here. I highly recommend subscribing to Greg's podcast!It was a good if depressing discussion, in part about Trump's trade \"deals\" but also about how they are being (mis)reported. The question is how something like the agreement with the European Union, in which the U.S. imposed taxes on its own population while Europe made meaningless promises on investment and energy purchases, leads to headlines like this:Long ago the economist Joan Robinson arguably pre-butted Trump's argument for protectionism because, he claims, other nations are treating us unfairly:The popular view that free trade is all very well so long as all nations are free-traders, but that when other nations erect tariffs we must erect tariffs too, is countered by the argument that it would be just as sensible to drop rocks into our harbours because other nations have rocky coasts.But it's even worse when a president mines our harbors based on the false claim that other nations have rocky coasts — and the media declare that he's winning.I've talked about the media's problem with calling a lie a lie for many years — in fact, since my first year writing for the Times. Back then, faced with George W. Bush's lies about taxes and Social Security, I suggested that if a candidate said the earth was flat, the headlines would read \"Views differ on shape of planet.\" Yet media organizations still haven't figured out how to deal with it. I told Greg,[T]o say that the president of the U.S. is making drastic policy changes in order to cure a problem that only exists in his imagination, that's a very difficult ... that sounds unbalanced. That sounds like you're shilling for the Democrats, when it's in fact just reporting the flat truth.And so I think the media organizations have still not figured out how to deal with that. The fact of the matter is that Trump's whole trade war is based upon a deluded version of how the world economy works. But aside from the fact that the Trump administration may try to punish your organization if you report that, it also just runs very counter to the \"people want to sound objective.\" And unfortunately, again, it's the old Stephen Colbert line, \"Reality has a well-known liberal bias.\" If you report what's really happening, it sounds liberal.What I should have said is that this problem is a lot bigger than trade. International economics is my home turf, so I tend to focus on how Trump has destroyed the international trading system and brought back Smoot-Hawley-level tariffs based on the assertion that other countries are taking advantage of us and blocking our exports, which is pure fantasy. But there are worse things than tariffs, and they are also being justified with completely false claims.What's worse than tariffs? Mass deportation, with masked men claiming to be government agents — who can tell? — seizing people off the street, in some cases sending them to overseas gulags. All of this is being justified with claims that Americans are being terrorized by immigrant criminals. Trump:You can't walk across the street to get a loaf of bread. You get shot, you get mugged, you get raped, you get whatever it may be.In fact, crime has plunged:Source: Jeff AsherBut how many headlines have you seen pointing out that Trump is destroying basic civil liberties in the name of fighting a nonexistent crime wave? There have been a few — my sense is that the media are a little more willing to call out lies about crime than lies about economics. But Trump's hyping of a fake crime wave should be central to all reporting about his anti-immigrant policies, and it isn't.And then there are the attacks on universities. Not my field of expertise, but as far as I can tell the idea that universities have been taken over by wokeness, DEI, and all that is completely at odds with the evidence. Can you find antisemitism on college campuses? Of course, because you can find antisemitism everywhere. But I'm a lot more afraid of MAGA, which is infested with actual Nazis, than I am of a few leftist college students.Anyway, no, Trump isn't winning his trade war — except, possibly, in the media, which have apparently decided that shooting yourself in the foot and not facing retaliation is a victory.MUSICAL CODANothing to do with topic.

Throughout this month you are invited to four events designed to introduce you to the history of metaphysics, including: the core of the metaphysical tradition, from Plato to Leibniz, the Kantian turn opening us to a post-metaphysical universe, the possible return of metaphysics in contemporary philosophy, as well as reflections on the relation of pure reason and mystical knowing. The entire schedule can be found below:To get involved, you can either sign up as a member of The Portal, which gives you access to the entire history of our recordings, as well as four live events every month, and discounts on past/future courses; or you can sign up for the month as a stand alone mini-course, giving you access to all four live events, as well as lifetime access to the recordings. Find out more below:The PortalMetaphysics ResurrectedIn order to prepare for this month, I hosted a conversation with Shaul to reflect on many of the themes that we hope to explore more fully throughout August. You can find that conversation below:What you can find below are some general themes that we hope to expand on in the mini-course:Metaphysics in GeneralMetaphysics in general is the science of causes, and a cause is any reason or explanation for some caused thing (e.g. material, efficient, formal, final). We exist in a world of causes. We ask, simply: why? Why are things the way they are? Why are things not some other way?For Shaul, the key is that we can do that both backwards and forwards: backwards into the first cause or primary beginning of all things, and forwards until you reach some final cause or end of all things as the purpose. Traditionally, in the Platonic tradition, the only good candidate for first and final cause is God. God is here traditionally associated with \"The Good\": both The Good that gives rise to all beings/existence itself, and The Good towards which all things are striving, and which in the human universe becomes an ethical political ideal. For Shaul, this system encapsulates the metaphysical tradition from Plato to Leibniz, and provides us with the structure for orienting humans collectively. Grand NarrativesMetaphysics is not only about the absolute and eternal divine cause and end of all things, it is also the belief that pure reason can come to know the absolute and eternal divine cause and end of all things. The three traditional objects that metaphysics claims to know through pure reason are \"God, Soul, and World\". This triad forms the basis for both the absolute first and final cause (God), our being and mind in relation to that cause (Soul), as well as the container or stage on which we dramatise our origin and orient our end (World). From the critical philosophy of Kant onwards, however, there is the idea that we need to, through the critique of pure reason, abandon metaphysics, its structure and its project: we cannot know God, Soul and World. For Kant, God, Soul, and World are \"noumenal\" (unknowable through pure reason). This tradition has intensified in various forms that we could call \"the death of metaphysics\" or even \"the death of God\".For Shaul, he asks: have we exhausted this critical field as a whole? Does 20th century philosophy demonstrate that we were perhaps mistaken to think we can get rid of metaphysics, its structure and its project? Has the end of metaphysics come to an end? Do we need to return to a new beginning of the metaphysical tradition? If so, how would one revive the tradition and structure from Plato to Leibniz? Can we revive metaphysics while also incorporating the justified criticisms of 19th and 20th century philosophy?Kantian TurnWhile there have always been critics of metaphysics (e.g. sophists, materialists, nominalists, skeptics, empiricists), Kant was the first to critique metaphysics on its own terms: pure reason. Kant is the first to argue against metaphysics in the name of pure reason itself. For Shaul, we might consider this the \"euthanasia of pure reason\", i.e. pure reason destroys itself in its own thinking. The philosophical revolution of Kantian philosophy here mirrors the social revolutions of his time: the French and American Revolutions, respectively. While political revolutions were concerned with killing the king, Kant killed the reason that justified the metaphysical position of the king (e.g. \"Divine Right of Kings\"). Through these revolutions the metaphysical systems orienting the collective social substance to \"The Good\" were replaced with the human mind and freedom as the absolute.Today we are living in the wake of these social and philosophical revolutions. They of course have much to offer (e.g. individual rights, free speech), but also have many problems (e.g. what is our freedom for?). How can we think the relation between the ancient metaphysical systems orienting towards The Good (often under divine presuppositions of a heavenly hierarchy), and modern notions of freedom (liberty, equality)?Today, discussions in this direction are often framed under the banner of \"post-liberalism\", i.e. the exhaustion of liberalism, and the need for a higher order principle that does not simply leave us in a flat individualism. Throughout modernity, the signifiers communism and fascism have most notably been associated with that turn, but in the disappointment and failures of those projects, many ask: what about returning to Platonic metaphysics? Liberalism and PlatonismFor Shaul, the problem with liberalism is that it doesn't endorse any particular vision of The Good life, it doesn't think of politics as pursuing The Good. Rather, liberalism creates a neutral procedural formal space where each individual or group of individuals can pursue their own concept of The Good life in freedom without interference from other human beings. What is good to one may not be for the other, and thus not an absolute orienting the human collective as a totality. Shaul warns us that Plato and Aristotle alike may worry about that project, as it could lead to nihilism. Indeed, it is well known that the history of modern liberal project has cast the shadow of nihilism, or always seems haunted by its possibility. Is this because we don't have a collective vision of The Good life? Is it because each man is as an individual the \"measure of all things\"? Are we doomed to nihilism without a political collective that endorses a species notion of The Good?In Shaul's work, he link the Platonic tradition to the Judaic tradition in the idea of the Kingdom of God. What is called the absolute and eternal Good is God, and in that frame, God is king. The principle: no man can be a king over any other, only God can be king. For Shaul, this is an ideal political system that both frames God as the divine shepherd over humanity, but among humans, leaves us to our freedom and equality. Here Shaul asks us: is this political view realisable without divine intervention? We know what Christianity has to say about that. But what about modern liberalism? Does it not presuppose that we can realise freedom and equality without God at all? We know what the 20th century has to say about that.Here we are left to face many questions.Liberalism as VoidThe furthest extremes of anti-metaphysical thinking terminates in a political vision of democracy as the absence of Truth, and the absence of The Good, in absolute and eternal form. For example, in the philosophy of democratic materialism we find only bodies and languages, and no absolute Truths or The Good. Shaul asks us to consider Jacques Derrida's \"democracy to come\" which uses deconstruction to license a form of government that can constantly undo itself, to rethink and re-reflect on itself. Or consider Richard Rorty's pragmatic democracy which frames democracy as the open space of contestation without an overriding Good or Truth to be the final arbiter of ethical determination. In contrast, more recent forms of dialectical materialism add to the mix of bodies and languages, the Truth, but in a non-idealist form, and often in a non-democratic form. Consider a figure like Alain Badiou who suggests that the democracy of bodies and languages needs to be supplemented with Truth-Events: we decide upon a The Good life through fidelity to a Truth-Event. Here consider radical breaks in history like the French, American or Russian Revolutions: these Truth-Events either become The Good or the bad in relation to our fidelity to their historical opening. Or consider a figure like Slavoj Žižek, who thinks the Truth in the form of an abyssal act, a tarrying with negativity; and in the context of liberal politics, do we find a notion of \"The Good\" in orientation towards some form of negative (\"War\") Communism? For Shaul, what both the democratic and dialectical materialist approaches to Truth and The Good miss is that they are just opening us to more and more void. Shaul again asks us to think from the standpoint of a neo-Platonist: what is the ground of liberalism? Is it negativity and void all the way down? Have we considered the possibility that materialism needs to be supplemented with an immaterial/ideal notion of The Good as the highest principle? Here material is conceived as secondary to, not the void, but The Good. As we covered above, this turns out to be life under kingship of God.Platonic Political MythShaul reminds us that Plato frames a political narrative, a story about the ideal human organisation, that articulates an original Golden Age where The Goods (universal justice, peace, harmony, happiness) were realised. However, in this story, we fell from this ideal, and we now find ourselves in a degradation from The Good: we are without rudder and steersman. In this story, we are without direction and in degradation until the point of total destruction, where oars will be taken up, and proper orientation will be rediscovered towards a future Golden Age, where we re-realise \"The Goods\": universal justice, peace, harmony, happiness.How is this possible? Shaul tells us that Plato and Aristotle both teach us that all human beings desire The Good, and that no one desires the bad. The problem in human civilisation is that humans start to equate The Good with wealth, power, fame, and pleasure as ends in themselves, as opposed to possible means towards The Good. For Plato and Aristotle, nothing can ultimately satisfy human beings: not wealth, power, fame or pleasure, except God who is the ultimate Good. How does this work in practice? For Shaul, he speaks for the ethics of divine imitation: just as God is perfectly just and wise, we should strive to be perfectly just and wise. Without divine imitation, we fall into manly imitation, and start striving for wealth, power, fame or pleasure, and thus sacrifice the happiness of unity with the divine and eternal absolute, for a temporary satisfaction in secular worldly pleasure.The practical political challenge for a neoPlatonist is something like: is collective realisation and embodiment of divine imitation possible? Can we bring heaven to earth? Can we achieve both inner and outer peace and restore the Golden Age in Plato's political myth? Alternatively, for the Platonist, are we doomed to an eternal liberal degradation without righting the ship?Modern to Ancient Return?Shaul is sometimes asked: is your neoPlatonist project nothing but a return to the ancient and an obfuscation of the modern? Is all value in the ancient, and is there no value in the modern? Shaul's response is that there is a confusion between the ancient and the modern on the level of freedom and The Good. While the modern puts freedom as its absolute, as an end in itself (subordinating The Good to a relativity); the ancient puts The Good as an end in itself (subordinate freedom to a relativity). He notes that the performative contradiction for the modern subject is that, while thinking of freedom as the absolute, many still believe that freedom should be constrained in relation to Evil. Moreover, many still believe that this constraint is not just for The Good of society, but also for The Good of that individual, because through Evil, we damage both the social and our individual soul. Shaul also notes that the modern subject can learn something general from the ancient metaphysics of The Good: that while one is free to pursue wealth, fame, power, and pleasure, that all of these freedoms can be used for either Good or Evil. But what is the only thing that can be used for good? The Good.While Shaul notes that this argument is a tautology, and that much of philosophy seems to find itself in tautology, he maintains that without at least an attempt to salvage the core of the ancient philosophical perspective, we head into the future without a real aim and orientation.

      "content": "As part of my ongoing quest to unscramble my brain by reading classic literature, I recently wrapped up an eight-week Zoom discussion group on Emily Brontë's 1847 novel \"Wuthering Heights\" run by The Catherine Project. This was, to put it mildly, not my favorite of the various 19th-century English novels I've read this year. But because I actually discussed it at length with other human beings, I did end up engaging more deeply with the text than some of the other books I enjoyed more. We also read the book at a slower pace than I normally read, so I had plenty of time to process my reactions and poke around on the internet to get a sense of others' and learn about the many film adaptations of the story.Still, I ultimately found the novel a bit unsatisfying. Brontë writes some great scenes, but with the complicated multi-layered framing device, I often found it hard to know what to make of the plot and I missed the social realism that a lot of other celebrated works of this time have. But some of these unsatisfying elements are what make it an interesting text to engage with — the book has been received differently in different eras, in response to different modes of criticism and evolving political sentiments and social norms. I also think, though, that interpretations of the text have been driven at least in part by the film adaptations, many of which wrestle Brontë's story into something more straightforward than the book: a great love story, as the distributors of the 1939 version put it. The love story between Catherine and Heathcliff that is the focus of this adaptation — and most subsequent ones — is the real cultural legacy of the book. It's the thing people who half-remember \"Wuthering Heights\" from high school remember, it's the thing people who haven't read it think they know about it, and it's the thing that ends up on movie posters. But (spoilers) Catherine dies in Chapter 16 of a book with 34 chapters, and the first three chapters are spent setting up a framing device in which she doesn't appear. The relationship between Catherine and Heathcliff is a crucial driver of the plot, but in a literal sense, the book mostly consists of other stuff. On a straightforward reading of the text, Heathcliff is more like an antihero than the kind of character you'd expect to see played by dashing leading men like Laurence Olivier, Charlton Heston, Richard Burton, Timothy Dalton, Ralph Fiennes, and Tom Hardy. Hollywood went spelunking in a novel about multi-generational child abuse, abduction, and betrayal, and pulled out something more film-able. And yet, there are modern readings of the text that suggesting maybe the Hollywood version of the story is something closer to the \"right\" one, and that the story told the novel is a kind of slander perpetrated by a small-minded racist.

      "content": "Protagoras the Sophist (left) vs Plato the Philosopher (right).In 5th century BCE Athens the power of speech was crucial, because in a democracy one had to convince others, by way of facts and reason, that a certain course of action was best for the community. Imagine what that meant: for the first time in history an individual (male, not enslaved, of course) could become prominent in the community not because he was rich or strong, or because he descended from an \"aristocratic\" lineage, but because he argued well.The other side of the coin, however, was that speech lends itself to manipulation, and once citizens in the assembly became unable to tell the difference between truth and falsehood, Athens embarked on a disastrous course of action during the Peloponnesian War against Sparta, which eventually led to the city's destruction. As you can see, fake news and alternative facts exact a price when they are not exposed and cleansed by the light of reason and evidence. Robin Waterfield gives us a vivid summary of the resulting mess:\"Within a day or two in 433 BCE, the Athenians voted first not to interfere in Corcyran affairs and then to do so—a decision that played a major part, as they knew, in provoking the Peloponnesian War. In 430 they deposed and impeached Pericles, only to reinstate him the following year. Within twenty-four hours in 428, they changed their minds about how severely to punish Mytilene. In 415, they were wholeheartedly committed to the Sicilian expedition, but after it had failed, they took no responsibility themselves.\" (Why Socrates Died, Faber and Faber, 2009, p. 140)After Athens fell to Sparta, the Spartans put in place a puppet government which became known as the Thirty Tyrants. The name is well deserved: scholars estimate that the Thirty put to death 5% of the entire population in less than a year.According to Robin Reames, who tells this story in her The Ancient Art of Thinking for Yourself—The Power of Rhetoric in Polarized Times, \"in the years that led up to the fall of democracy, truth had taken a serious beating.\" Accordingly, she raises the obvious, if difficult, question: what do we mean by \"truth\"?In modern philosophy, it is customary to distinguish several theories, or accounts of truth, for instance the correspondence one used mainly in science and everyday activities, or the coherence one used in logic and mathematics. (There are several other candidates as well.) Reames, however, focuses her attention on a particularly interesting contrast: that between our modern intuitive understanding of truth, rooted in literacy and the ability to write things down, vs the Ancient Greek, pre-literate account of truth, rooted in the oral tradition.In modern/literate terms, an utterance is true if its content corresponds to the actual state of things. For instance, if I say \"Saturn has rings,\" this is true if and only if it turns out, by looking through a telescope or by other means, that we can verify that, indeed, the planet Saturn is surrounded by rings. Notice that what is true (or not) is an utterance, which means that the concept of truth is inherently linked to language. The idea is that the function of language is to represent the world, which in turn implies that something is true if it represents the world accurately.Saturn, truly donned with rings. Image from space.com.Contrast the above with the ancient/oral approach, say in the world of Homer or Hesiod. In that case, language's purpose was not to represent reality, according to Reames, but rather to show or conceal something, respectively by bringing it to light or by hiding it.This difference between approaches to truth has some startling consequences. We moderns tend to think of \"false\" as the natural opposite of \"true,\" right? But these antonyms were actually framed in such fashion by Plato, one of the first philosophers to make use of the then still rather new technique of writing. Before Plato, the \"natural\" opposition was between something being true or hidden. How did this shift (from true <> hidden to true <> false) happen?Reames reminds us that before the invention of writing, people spoke in formulaic ways that were meant to be mnemonic aids. Consider the quintessential example, Homer's poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey. In them, Achilles is referred to as \"brave\" and Odysseus as \"clever,\" because Achilles represented that society's very idea of bravery, just as Odysseus personified the essence of cleverness. The people who heard those stories told by specialized story-tellers known as rhapsodes, were meant to empathize with the various characters on the basis of recognizable, standardized descriptions of those characters.Clever Odysseus, my favorite Homeric hero, played by Ralph Fiennes in the movie The Return. Image from thehollywoodnews.com.This explains an otherwise bizarre Platonic dialogue, the Ion, in which Socrates, representing the new, literacy-based approach known as \"philosophy,\" criticizes the title character, a rhapsode, for pretending to possess knowledge of, say, military maneuvers, just because he can recite battle scenes from the Homeric poems. The latter notion is entirely untenable by modern standards, but those standards were not there before Plato introduced them.(Remember that Plato was also the one that articulated the still largely accepted definition of knowledge: justified true belief, which he discusses in the Theaetetus.)As Reames says, \"Prior to the rise of literacy, listeners were spellbound by the word magic of poetic language, and the experience of listening to poets like Homer was almost trance-like for the audience. It was a whole, bodily, sympathetic engagement.\" Read more",

To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.Note: Phil and Minna will do their next Substack Live tomorrow (Friday 1 August) at 2pm UK time, (3pm CET and 9am US East Coast Time). We will be covering US-European relations in some detail, taking questions and talking about special shows that will be coming up. Please come and listen. Hello Everyone,The recent trade deal with the US once more sparked a debate in Europe about when it is time to go for eye for an eye (or, potatoes for potatoes as we say in Finland) with Trump. Trump's love for optical wins has distorted the debate to the extent that the EU and the US came out with quite different understandings of what they agreed on from last Sunday's meeting that sealed a preliminary political agreement to avoid an all-out trade war. As with the June NATO Summit, also with the trade deal the question has become: what matters more, optics or reality? Although for Trump, optics are everything, others still need to deal with the reality too.Yours,MinnaTrump and von der Leyen at the Trump golf course in Turnberry, Scotland, Friday, July 27, 2025. Photo: White House/ Daniel TorokOptics vs RealityAs with all of Trump's trade deals so far, also with the US-EU preliminary framework deal agreed on last Sunday it has been hard to discern optics from real impact. The optics were for sure pretty devastating for the EU, which seemed to have agreed on multiple unreciprocated concessions. The reality is, however, less clear – especially as the US government published a factsheet contradicting the EU's version of what was agreed on. Most importantly, the agreement is not legally binding and simply sets the stage for further negotiations. But enforcement of a more substantial agreement will be difficult if there is no shared understanding of what was agreed on.As Phil already outlined the Trump administration's view, I will in my turn focus on the EU side. The deal was heavily criticised for the impression that the EU gave up without a fight and simply agreed on a bad deal to avoid worse – an all-out trade war. Especially the French, who would like to see a more sovereign and confident Europe, were fuming. President Macron has recently taken a liking to the idea that \"to be free, we must be feared\", which he used as a justification for increased defence spending, and applied it in the reverse sense to the trade deal: \"Europe was not feared enough\". After some initial finger-pointing to the German direction, with Germany's Merz having sought a quick resolution as opposed to the French wish to showing more strength, both France and Germany now agree that the deal is bad.But what was agreed on? The only fairly certain element seems to be the 15 percent tariff on all EU goods, which the EU interprets as a ceiling. For most goods this means an increase from the current 10 percent tariff that has been in place during the tariff pause, but for cars the tariff goes down from the current 27.5 percent level. The EU interprets the general 15 percent ceiling to apply also to pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, but in reality nobody knows, as the US is still examining the question. In any case the EU has accepted a non-reciprocal tariff that avoids a wider trade war, and tariffs hurt the one who imposes them most. But this also means accepting a new economic world order where WTO rules about non-discrimination and equal treatment do not apply.Further statements from the White House factsheet that have caused a stir are more of nothingburgers: the EU expressed an intention to buy US energy products for a whopping $750 billion (ca. €700 billion) over the next three years. However, that is unlikely to materialise, both because the US cannot supply the amount and because there are limits to demand in the EU. As Paul Krugman puts it, the EU played the US for a \"fossile fool\". The EU also metioned that \"EU companies have expressed interest in investing at least $600 billion (ca. €550 billion) in various sectors in the US by 2029\", which only makes sense as a repackaging of already existing investment plans. And the most mysterious claim in the US factsheet, that the EU \"agreed to purchase significant amounts of U.S. military equipment\", is not even mentioned in the EU version – for a good reason. The EU cannot buy US military equipment, it is the member states who decide where they go shopping. Since no European country has any intention to stop buying US kit immediately, this is the biggest nothingburger of them all.Reactions among European economists and industries have been mixed. While e.g. the German chemical industry used the occasion to demand state-sponsored relief to offset the double burden of tariffs and high energy costs, the Mechanical Engineering Industry Association points out that practically every American manufactoring sector depends on European imports and will be hard hit. the German economist Ulrike Malmendier pointed out that the tariffs make US markets less accessible generally, which can lead to more interest in the EU's internal market as an export destination. Rikard Forslid, a Swedish national economist, assessed the 15 percent tariff as a disappointment but not too dramatic, as 10-15 percent has been on the table for a while and companies can adjust to it once the playing field is clear.The question is, then, how the reality of Trump's \"deal\" will look like and what comes out of the negotiations for a more binding trade agreement. At the moment, the EU is negotiating trade agreements with 8 different countries plus Mercosur, including large economies such as India and Brazil. A stymied US market access might inspire the negotiation parties to speed things up. What the experience with Trump has certainly shown, however, is that the EU struggles to deal with an actor who is not out for win-win outcomes and does not negotiate in good faith – both essential parts of the EU logic. The EU also still cannot act as more than the sum of its parts.P.S. Speaking of wins, the Office of the US Trade Representative published this bizarre list of praise of the dear leader for the EU-US trade deal. My highlight is this \"thank you for nothing\" from Delta Airlines: \"The US/EU trade agreement reached between President Trump and EU leadership is welcome news given it preserves a zero-tariff environment on aircraft and component parts, a reciprocal policy that's been in place for over 40 years (emphasis added).\"Share",

Find out more and apply for that here.Works in Progress is looking for someone to run a new daily newsletter that aggregates and links to news stories, essays, podcasts, videos, and other 'content' for people who are interested in scientific and technological progress, economic growth, YIMBYism, beautiful cities, global health, clean energy, artificial intelligence, the politics of 'abundance', and other things we and our readers care about.We want to make this newsletter the go-to daily briefing for people interested in the Progress Studies / abundance world – a Morning Brew or 1440 for people who want to know about Vietnam building a high-speed rail line in record speed, or a new programme launching to eradicate malarial mosquitoes in Cape Verde, or a new bill that would legalise dense housing in Oklahoma City, or a new article that's out about mapping nematode brains. We aren't aware of a service aggregating news and writing in these areas, so we are starting one.What you'll doYour role will be to browse the internet all day looking for things that people will want to read and listen to, and write a newsletter each weekday rounding up the most interesting links, sent out early morning US time. The newsletter will be focused on links with brief commentary on each, rather than primarily being content you have written yourself. We'll probably start with one issue every two or three days and build up to once a day (on weekdays) once you've gotten the hang of it.Who you should beYou should be someone who spends an awful lot of time on the internet already, reading and listening to things in the areas we're interested in. (If you could imagine a Works in Progress article about it, it's probably relevant.) You should already be someone who is alert to interesting news around the world, and read a lot of good, obscure websites that other people will be pleased to get the best of from you. You should also be capable of setting up Google Alerts and using AI, and other tools to stay on top of things. If the thought of being paid to trawl the internet all day for interesting news and essays appeals to you, then you might be a good fit. You must be extremely familiar with at least some of the subject areas we're interested in and excited about learning more about the others.You must be a capable writer, who can read and write in English as well as a native speaker, and not need to use Grammarly or other software to produce clean copy. You can be based anywhere in the world, but you must be willing to write the newsletter so that it is up to date and ready to send at 6 or 7am Pacific Time. (If you are in the Americas, that will mean working early in the morning; if you are in Asia, it could mean working late at night.) Prior experience doing something like this isn't necessary, although if you have done a regular aggregator newsletter like this before, that could help. Salary and contract lengthWe will pay between $50,000–80,000/year (USD) for this role and we will initially offer a one year contract for it, with a view to extending if we decide the project is worth continuing. This is a fully remote role and you may be based anywhere to do it, as long as we can legally contract with and pay you.How to applyTo apply, send us the following:An up-to-date resume.Up to 300 words about yourself and your suitability for the role.A pre-existing sample of your writing.Five of your favourite 'content sources' (newsletters, blogs, podcasts, Youtube channels, etc) that you consider to be underrated, with a couple of sentences about why. Show us that you are able to dig into the lesser-known corners of the internet where great work is being produced.Up to ten links from the seven days prior to sending that you could imagine including in a newsletter, plus one sentence each explaining why. Ideally this will include a mixture of news stories, essays, podcasts and videos, as well as anything else you might expect to include in the daily newsletter.Please send this to wip-hiring@stripe.com before August 16th. You may use AI to help with your submission, but if you do, you must tell us and briefly explain how you used it. (This includes the writing sample.) We will not respond to applications that we suspect have used AI without saying so.",

      "content": "In 2023, a Queenslander noticed an interesting clam in the river waters of Ipswich, a town outside of Brisbane. She took a picture and uploaded it to the citizen scientist platform iNaturalist. The images were of freshwater gold clams, a highly invasive species that was, up to that point, found everywhere except Australia and Antarctica. That one image triggered Australia’s new biosecurity alert service, which enabled environmental officers to immediately remove the clams and set up a monitoring program to check their spread. Australia is in the midst of a biodiversity crisis, and while the country has strict biosecurity controls, invasive plants, animals and diseases are getting into the country, either intentionally or inadvertently. Freshwater gold clams (also known as Asian clams) found in the Brisbane River in Australia and shared on iNaturalist. Credit: Tommi Mason / iNaturalist To help identify, track and manage invasive species, the Atlas for Living Australia (ALA) — the country’s biodiversity database — now directly connects citizen science data shared on iNaturalist with the country’s biosecurity agencies. The ALA contains over 151 million records, including 2,300 introduced species and almost 10 million weeds and pests. The initial ALA records came from museum data, but now, says ALA biosecurity analyst Andrew Turley, about 50 percent of the data comes from citizen science — most of that via iNaturalist. The ALA runs Australia’s iNaturalist node. (Australia is one of 20 countries with its own node, a local version of the app run in partnership with a local institution.) More than 120,000 Australians now use iNaturalist, and they upload 10,000 new sightings every single day. There are over 11 million observations on the Australian iNaturalist node. In fact, Australians are among the top iNaturalist users in the world, with the third-most observations and second-most for species. The biosecurity alerting system was piloted in 2020. In 2023 alone, 1,442 iNaturalist records triggered biosecurity alerts; overall, 99 percent of alerts are thanks to citizen scientists. Another example of a citizen scientist finding an invasive species was when an iNaturalist user uploaded images of the Asian shore crab in Victoria during the system’s first six months. “That was the first public report of Asian shore crab in Victoria, and the biosecurity department in Victoria didn’t know that it was present there either,” says Turley. These initial proofs that the systems worked led to more support, he says, and the ALA was able to develop the system further. An image uploaded to iNaturalist is parsed by the app’s A.I. and also community members, who can help identify what species it is. Every week, the ALA downloads all the new Australia iNaturalist photos, explains Turley, and that data is matched against the pests, weeds and diseases that are of interest to various biosecurity departments. Then an alert is automatically sent out to local management authorities. An Asian shore crab spotted in Port Phillip Bay near Melbourne and reported on iNaturalist. Credit: John Eichler / iNaturalist The ALA has spatial layers so that alerts cover broad or specific areas, and also custom shapes, where an area can be delineated. The environmental department responsible for a national park, for instance, can request only data found within the park and will only receive alerts if pests turn up within that area. “We’ve really tried to work with the biosecurity departments, find out: What do they actually need? How can we make this tool most effective for what they’re needing to protect from the threats of invasive alien species?” Turley says. Thomas Mesaglio, a botanical ecoinformatics doctoral student at the University of New South Wales and one of iNaturalist Australia’s site administrators, has been using the app since August 2018. It was in 2019 that user numbers and species added to the site really shot through the roof (likely, at least in part, because a similar Australian citizen science platform called BowerBird shut down) with “exponential growth in every metric that you can imagine,” he says. “In those last five or six years, you name it, number of records, number of species, number of observers, pick any metric you want,” he says. “They’re all just skyrocketing.” That activity has helped identify invasives like opuntia, or prickly pear cactus, which is originally from the Americas and is on Australian state governments’ alert lists as a high priority biosecurity threat. Opuntia sightings logged in 2023 on iNaturalist prompted an alert, and biosecurity specialists went to the sites where the plants had been found and dispatched them. Weighed down by negative news? Our smart, bright, weekly newsletter is the uplift you’ve been looking for. [contact-form-7] “The speed that the whole system works with is such a key element,” says Mesaglio. “In the past, maybe it would have been six to eight months before the news got around to someone who could do something about it.” Other early discoveries from iNaturalist that produced alerts include red imported fire ants — native to South America — and mouse-ear hawkweed, a plant from Europe and Asia. Amanda Roe, a researcher with the Canadian Forest Service and co-author of a recent paper about citizen science and biosecurity, points out that regular people have often been the first to find invasive species, like the Asian long-horned beetle in North America. “Curious people see things,” says Roe. “They notice things about the natural world, and those are the people that are often going to find something new.” Other countries are also beginning to integrate citizen scientist data into their biosecurity efforts, including Finland, which also uses iNaturalist data. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is integrating iNaturalist into its biosurveillance, says Roe. Australia seems to be the most advanced, but, as Roe points out, Australia has the advantage of being an island. And, indeed, the country’s invasive species hotspots are all near major shipping ports, says Turley. The ALA biosecurity platform is a good model, Roe says, because it used what was already happening instead of creating something entirely new. An opuntia cactus spotted near Hattah-Kulkyne National Park in Victoria and shared on iNaturalist. Credit: Bec Schwinghammer / iNaturalist “People are already using that platform, so why not meet people where they’re at?” she says. “There will always be more citizen scientists than experts.” And the experts are also turning to iNaturalist Australia. Mesaglio has noted an increase in experts using iNaturalist and connecting with citizen scientists, something which Turley has also noticed. The experts frequently ask for more details, like exact locations, Turley says. “We do often see biosecurity users getting in and contacting [users] via the chat functions in iNaturalist,” he says. But the ALA doesn’t promote the biosecurity alerts to iNaturalist users, and most iNaturalist users are likely unaware that their images are connected to biodiversity alerting, says Mesaglio. In Victoria, Peter Crowcroft has been on iNaturalist since 2017. The app, he says, motivates him to pay more attention to the natural world. But he didn’t realize that iNaturalist activity was helping with biosecurity efforts. “Sometimes you get the impression that these data source points are not being utilized to their full potential,” he says. “So it’s really good that there can be some kind of alert for species which are security issues.” It would be nice to send alerts quicker, says Turley, although that means figuring out how to manage the large amount of data that continues to be added to the database.

Anyone, regardless of background or knowledge, can contribute in a “really meaningful way,\" says Mesaglio, by discovering new species, identifying new and spreading invasives, and adding to data on common species. “All of these small acts add up and contribute to the collective big whole,” he says. “I think a large driving factor is the increasing collective awareness that you don’t have to be the world expert in a group of organisms to make a meaningful scientific contribution.” UPDATE — August 12, 2025: This story has been updated to reflect that Peter Crowcroft lives in Victoria, and to include the correct number of Australians who use iNaturalist.

      "content": "I haven't done a recap in a while—partly because I've been torn between sharing too much and leaving space for relatability. Sometimes there can be so much pressure to write the perfectly currated piece that taking the time to write casual and more blog like is refreshing. And July felt like one of those months that deserved to be noticed. The kind that was both heavy and golden. After a busy few months, July didn't relent, but finally felt like I had found the groove.Here's the rundown of July, broken into little pieces: what kept me busy, what kept me fed, what kept me listening, and what kept me turning pages.Doing:-one year of this little newsletter!Somehow this little newsletter just turned one year old. I found Substack from CondimentClaire and loved the concept of Substack, but didn't immediately start writing, not thinking I had anything to offer. What I had in mind is very different from where this is now, and I'm not mad about it! The past year has seen growth and evolution in my writing and what I choose to post. I truly started the newsletter unsure if anyone would read, and now it's one of my favorite creative anchors. More than anything it has been such a reminder of how things will fall into place when they're supposed to. Whether you've been here since day one or just wandered in, thanks for reading, truly <3-going to see the F1 MovieI have not been to the cinema is an incredibly long time but took the holiday morning (fourth of july) to go. For me, the movie was good but overall fell flat from what I was expecting. I did love the soundtrack though! It was also relaxing to kick my feet up (they have the recliner seats) and enjoy snacks in the AC. (also later in the month went to see the Jurassic movie!)-tsitp watch \"party\"While visting my hometown, we hosted a very exclusive The Summer I Turned Pretty season 3 premiere \"watch party\"—just me, my mom, and my sister piled onto the couch. There were snacks, commentary, and drama. There was something sweet about it—like slipping back into an old version of girlhood for a night, where everything felt excitin and safe at the same time.-little sister turns 21 !!My little sister turned 21 this month, which still feels slightly impossible. She's somehow both fully grown and still the tiny kid I used to boss around. We celebrated with brunch, drinks, and my earnest attempt at bringing her very specific vision of a cherry chip cake to life. It's a tradition in our family to bake a birthday cake—whatver flavor is requested— so being home to do this for a milestone birthday was extra sweet.-a hot new bombshell (beaded embroidery) enters the villa (my hobbies)One of my friends told me I collect hobbies —i just have adhd. Lately, I've fallen down the beaded embroidery rabbit hole after seeing way too many cute embroidered bags and shirts. I'm currently working on a little pouch to toss in my shoulder bag or use when traveling. The design features my initial and takes inspiration from Lando's 2024 Hungary helmet, specifically the flowing blue vines and floral detailing. I wanted something that felt elevated but still playful and personal.vision board for the projectEating:July felt full of flavor, and only fitting for the 1 year anniversary month considering I want to have a food blog when first finding substack. After hitting a big goal, I treated myself to a mini lemon tart. I'm lucky to have a boyfriend who reminds me that I should celebrate, even when I hesitate, and he surprised me with a dinner date where I ordered a cheeky little mocktail, soft, pillowy gnocchi and we split tiramisu—one of my absolute favorites. There were other standouts too: homemade syrnyki on a slow morning, the juiciest burger that made me stop mid-bite to appreciate it, and a savory brunch for my sister's birthday. As the month closes out, I am beginning to work my way through Table for Two cookbook.Listening:-Just Keep Watching // Tate McRae-Purple Lace Bra // Tate McRae-Sports Car // Tate McRae-Kiss Kiss // Chris Brown, T-Pain-Hard Out Here // Raye-Five Star Hotels // Raye-Flip A Switch // Raye-Fukk Sleep // A$AP Rocky, FKA twigs-Ferrari // James Hype Miggy Dela Rosa-Monaco // Bad Bunny-Sprinter // Dave, Central Cee-Closing Time // Asha Banks-Shiver // Asha Banks-fourth dimension // arya x-So Good // NosiReading:Previously, I mentioned a five-book reading challenge to reinvigorate the brain and expand the kinds of books I reach for: one fiction, one nonfiction, one re-read, one wildcard, and one deep-dive into something niche. I'm slowly chipping away at my stack. Here's where I'm at so far:Fiction: Curse Carved in Bone - finshed this one this month. It didn't totally land for me, but it wasn't unenjoyable either. It just felt like it had so much potential and fell flat.Deep Dive: Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil - A dive into the history and world of Olive Oil through historical research and reporting. A new read I just picked up from the library for the little \"research project\" I am working on.Wildcard: The Quiet Tenant — 5/5 stars, I read this in three days. It was a blind-date-with-a-book pick from my local bookstore, chosen purely based on the \"Spotify Daylist\" style song labels they paired it with. This thriller was enough to creep me out (couldn't convince myself to run on my favorite trail after) and keep me wanting more. Re-read: debating whether to keep going with my TOG re-read or start revisiting a childhood favorite.Nonfiction: The Eurasian Century: Hot Wars, Cold Wars, and the Making of the Modern World - just started this one! With my background in international relations/security and the curent global state, the subject matter feels especially relevant, and I'm excited to really dig into it.Recommending:-Cowboy Colostrum: I gave it a try after a recommendation, and after about a month and half, I've seen noticeable improvements. My hair feels stronger and fuller, my nails are so long and less brittle, and as a stomach issues girly, my digestion and bloating has definitely improved. It's expensive but well worth it. I love making my lattes with this instead of a flavored creamer or syrup.(use code KYLEE1 for 15% off but no pressure to use. this is a product i buy with my own money :))-Pinterest vision boards: Anytime I have an idea but can't quite see the full picture: Pinterest. It helps me bring the vision to life and gives me something to reference when I'm actually executing it, whether it's an outfit, a dinner party, new project (see collage above for beaded pouch) or rethinking a space in my apartment.-clean out your camera roll: Mine was overflowing with screenshots, duplicates, and accidental photos. Taking time to delete the clutter and organize what I wanted to keep felt surprisingly therapeutic.-substack posts (i had to cut myself off with this because I would share everything I have read)Inner MonologueWhy \"I'm So Lonely\" Is the Most Important Line in Little WomenGreta Gerwig's Little Women gifted us one of the most heart-wrenching monologues in recent cinematic history.

      "content": "I promised some people longer responses: Thomas Cotter asks why people think \"consistency\" is an important moral value. After all, he says, the Nazis and Soviets were \"consistent\" with their evil beliefs. I'm not so sure of his examples - the Soviets massacred workers striking for better conditions, and the Nazis were so bad at race science that they turned against IQ research after Jews outscored Aryans - but I'm sure if he looked harder he could find some evil person who was superficially consistent with themselves.Hen Mazzig on Twitter is suspicious that lots of people oppose the massacres in Gaza without having objected equally strenuously to various other things. Again, he's bad at examples - most of the things he names are less bad than the massacres in Gaza - but I'm sure if he looked harder he could find some thing which was worse than Gaza and which not quite as many people had protested. Therefore, people who object to the massacres in Gaza must be motivated by anti-Semitism.An r/TrueUnpopularOpinion poster argues that No One Actually Cares About Gaza; Your Anger Is Performative. They say that (almost) nobody can actually sustain strong emotions about the deaths of some hard-to-pin-down number of people they don't know, and so probably people who claim to care are virtue-signaling or luxury-believing or one of those things.Since 2/3 of these are about Gaza, we'll start there. And since there's so much virtue-signaling and luxury-believing going around these days, I assure you that what I am about to share is my absolute most honest and deepest opinion, the one I hold in my heart of hearts.A few months ago, I read an article by an aid worker in Gaza recounting the horrors he'd seen. Among a long litany, one stood out. A little kid came into the hospital with a backpack. The doctors told him he had to put it down so they could treat him, and he refused. The doctors insisted. The kid fought back. Finally someone opened the bag. It was some body part fragments from the kid's dead brother. He couldn't bear to leave him, so he carried them everywhere he went.I am a Real Man and therefore do not cry. But I confess to getting a little misty at this story, and I know exactly why. When my 1.5-year-old son wakes up early, the first words out of his mouth when I extract him from his crib are \"Yaya? Yaya?\" which is how he says his sister Lyra's name. No matter how I distract him, he'll keep saying \"Yaya? Yaya?\" and pointing at the door to her room until she wakes up, at which point he'll get a big smile and run over to her. It's impossible for me to read this story without imagining her body parts in the backpack and him saying \"Yaya? Yaya?\" in an increasingly distressed voice, over and over again, until the doctors drag him away.So my absolute most honest and deepest opinion on the war in Gaza, the one I hold in my heart of hearts, is: I would kill everyone in the entire region, on both sides, if it would give that kid his brother back.Probably this is why God doesn't connect people's heart-of-hearts directly to their motor cortex. Instead, He wisely intermediates other brain regions with names like \"anterior cingulate gyrus\" and \"dorsolateral prefrontal area\", the places where rationality happens. When I use my anterior cingulate gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal area, I have thoughts like these:Probably there are many other people in that region who have stories which are objectively just as sad as that boy's, but not precisely targeted to my personal heart-strings.Probably there are many other people in that region who have stories which would tug on my heart-strings just as much if I knew about them, but nobody has written articles about them. Or someone did, but I didn't read them.Even if I could kill everyone in the region to get that kid his brother back (how? some kind of deal with the Devil?) probably some of those people who I killed would have brothers, and some of those people would meet aid workers who would write sad articles, and then I'd be sad about them.If my country were being bombed, and my kids were being killed, and someone in another country had the capacity to affect the situation - even in the tiniest of ways - I would want that person doing the most sophisticated utility-maximization possible, not making semi-random bad decisions based on who got sympathetic articles written about them or tugged at their heart-strings the most.If I were to get all Kantian about it, I would say it feels beneath my dignity as a rational being to let my opinion on important world affairs be determined by which journalist managed to get the most horrifying story in front of my eyeballs today - and maybe pivot to the opposite side tomorrow when someone else catches my attention.Instead I try to have general principles. It's bad to kill people. It's bad to make people suffer. Then I add epicycle upon epicycle - is there a principle that countries which suffer terrorist attacks have the right to defend themselves? If no, then kids might lose their siblings in terrorist attacks that haven't been disincentivized; if yes, that \"defense\" might produce \"collateral damage\". Is there a principle that people who have had their land stolen can launch terrorist attacks to get it back? If yes, those terrorist attacks might kill kids' siblings; if no, land-stealing might be so costless that rights become meaningless and the world devolves into constant colonial conflict, which seems like the sort of thing where lots of siblings might die. I won't mention where I stand on these questions - partly because I don't want to start WWIII in the comments, partly because I'm not that sure myself - but I want to defend considering them. But at the end of considering them, I should treat whatever answer I get not as an alternative to doing something about my grief at the few stories that really catch my attention, but as an apotheosis of that grief - a stronger, more rigorous version of that grief, better by its own values and more capable of achieving its own goals. I already know how some of you are going to respond. You'll say that caring about a kid in Gaza because they passingly resemble my own kids is a misfire, a chance coincidence of emotional circuits. I should simply care about my own kids directly. But even caring about my own kids is a shaky alliance between my heart of hearts and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There are moments when I catch my kids smiling at me, and I know in my heart of hearts that I love them more than life itself and would do anything for them. There are also moments - usually when my son is throwing a tantrum - where I want to strangle him. Being a good parent involves this same process of deciding that a rational being shouldn't be whirled back and forth by random emotions all the time - loving his kids one moment and strangling them the next. It's transmuting transitory emotions into trustworthy principles like \"I love my children all the time and want the best for them\". I could not love you so, my dear, loved I not Honor more.(also, real evolution fans don't even love their own children - they donate to sperm banks and let other people invest resources in raising them. All human values disappear if you zoom out too far or zoom in too far - so what? So don't do that.)So here is my response to all three of the people I said I owed responses to.To Thomas: consistency matters because it's how morality forms in the first place. Everybody has some moral impulses. Those become principles only under the influence of a desire for consistency and for the dignity of a rational being. Hitler was a vegetarian, so he must have had some aversion to cruelty. That plus a dollar will buy you a soda a desire for consistency can prevent you from being history's greatest villain.To Hen: absent a level of perfect angelic rationality that no one has, we will never complete the process of generalization. Part of us will remain undignified slaves to whatever we hear heart-wrenching media stories about, whatever reminds us of people we know, and whatever sparks enough controversy to keep our attention. I can be sad about 9-11 even if I forgot to condemn a terrorist attack in Ougadogou two weeks earlier; I can be sad about the Holocaust even if I've never cried equally hard reading a book about the Taiping Rebellion, I can see my own kids in Columbine victims even if I have failed to see them in children affected by hookworm in Uganda. I'm not even sure I want to become a perfectly rational angelic being who has generalized every principle to the maximum extent - it sounds scarily inhuman. But to the extent that I do generalize, I would like to at least consider generalizing in the direction of more empathy (this one kid tugs at my heart - maybe I should also care about the war in Sudan!) rather than always in the direction of callousness (I didn't notice the war in Sudan when it was happening - perhaps I'm not allowed to care about this kid either).To the anonymous Redditor: no, I can't actually feel emotions about everyone in Gaza, and I'm not sure anyone else can either. This doesn't mean concern must be virtue signaling or luxury beliefs. It just means that it requires principle rather than raw emotion. One death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic. But if you're interested in having the dignity of a rational animal (a perfectly acceptable hobby! no worse than trying to get good at Fortnite or whatever!) then eventually you notice that a million is made out of a million ones and try to act accordingly.",

      "content": "As an astrobiologist, I am often teased about my profession. Some people believe that astrobiology is just a catchy buzzword used to garner headlines and secure funding. Others view it as mere science fiction — or worse, a pseudoscience — because it lacks a subject of study. The most common question I get about my field is, “How can you even do astrobiology when you haven’t found life in space yet?” My answer is always the same: “Ah, but we have found life in space.”People’s eyes widen as they wait for me to divulge state secrets about where we’re keeping the alien bodies. But the truth is far more down-to-Earth.“You are life in space,” I say. “We are all life in space.”The moment we realized our entire biosphere existed on the skin of a rocky planet hurtling through the void around a very ordinary star — one of some 100 to 400 billion stars in our galaxy, which is one of perhaps 2 trillion galaxies in the universe — we discovered life in space. The exciting question for astrobiologists today is, Could there be more of us out there?Astrobiology seeks to uncover generalizations about life: how it comes about, where to find it, and what it is in the first place. Because we are part of the set of all living things in space, astrobiological progress reflexively reveals new truths about us. Even if we never find other life out there, the search itself shapes how we understand our own stories right here on Earth. Astrobiology is more than just a buzzword or an idle fancy; it is the key to developing a sense of belonging as a planetary phenomenon.More Earths In The HeavensOver the last three decades, our discoveries of exoplanets — planets orbiting stars outside our solar system — have revealed that there are likely hundreds of billions of worlds in our galaxy alone. Most exoplanets are far from hospitable for life as we know it: These include so-called “hot Jupiters” — gas giants orbiting so rapidly that one of their years can occur in just a handful of Earth days — with temperatures in the thousands of degrees; colder Jupiters, which may resemble the gas giants of our solar system; and rocky planets so hot that their surfaces are oceans of molten magma. Astrobiologists, however, are most interested in the at least two dozen worlds that we know of, so far, that are just the right size and distance from their host stars to potentially support life as we know it. The first clues about an exoplanet’s habitability come from its atmosphere. After all, a thin sheath of gas makes life possible at the surface of our world, providing essential nutrients for the biosphere, protecting living things from harmful radiation, cycling water around the globe and keeping global temperatures in check. Luckily, atmospheric chemistry is one of the most readily observable features of an exoplanet; in most cases, the gases in its atmosphere leave their fingerprints in the starlight that reaches the range of our telescopes.With state-of-the-art technology like the James Webb Space Telescope, we have confirmed the presence of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and methane on hot, gaseous worlds that are incompatible with life. (These are molecules you might also expect to find on living planets: You breathe out carbon dioxide, the archaea in your gut emanate methane and volcanoes belch sulfur dioxide.) But to observe gases like these on Earth-like planets — small rocky worlds with razor-thin atmospheres — we require a new technology of perception: the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). HWO is, for now, only a telescope concept, a mere glimmer in the eyes of astrophysicists around the globe. Planned to launch in the early 2040s, it would be humankind’s first scope designed specifically to hunt for signs of life beyond our solar system, surveying roughly two dozen potentially habitable exoplanets for the exhalations of alien biospheres.The current schematics, though presently in flux, detail an instrument of unprecedented scale and power. HWO will be equipped with a 20 to 26-foot-diameter mirror and a sophisticated coronagraph that suppresses starlight, enabling us to image the faint light reflected off Earth-sized planets. Its spectrometers will sweep wavelengths from the deep ultraviolet through the visible and into the near infrared so as to gather a complete census of biogenic gases in a planet’s atmosphere, from oxygen and ozone (which absorb UV and visible light) to water vapor, carbon dioxide and methane (whose spectral features lie in the infrared). \"At least two dozen worlds that we know of ... are just the right size and distance from their host stars to potentially support life as we know it.\" But until HWO launches, to the best of our knowledge, most rocky exoplanets in the galaxy will remain Earth-sized blank canvases upon which we imagine exciting possibilities. Like science fiction writers, astrobiologists play “what if” experiments — except our stories aren’t written in prose, but in computer code. Astrobiologists assess exoplanet habitability using tools climate scientists have developed to predict Earth’s changing climate and that planetary scientists have used to investigate the climates of other solar system worlds. We take a known model of the Earth, Mars or Venus, for example, and tweak it — for example, changing its atmosphere, the ocean-to-continent ratio, the star it orbits, or the tilt of its axis — so that it now captures the processes of a more distant planet. While many of our simulations will be mere fictions, what makes them scientific is that these thought experiments are constrained by the known laws of physics, chemistry and biology. In the end, we produce scores of imaginary worlds that give us clues about what we need to look for to find another Earth-like planet using future observatories like HWO.This is because hunting for another Earth means searching for many different things. Earth has been many planets throughout its 4.6-billion-year history. It is believed to have started out as a hellish, volcanic world of blackened basalt. After the first oceans condensed onto the surface and life took hold, it may have appeared as a pale orange dot, thanks to a thick layer of organic haze. Later, it may have looked distinctly purple due to the pigments of early photosynthetic life. We know from the rock record that Earth went through global glaciations — the Snowball Earth episodes — during which it would have gleamed like a pearl in space. And now, it is a beautiful blue-green marble.The steps our planet took to reach its current form may be unique. Different initial conditions and coevolutionary tangos with life could have resulted in completely novel planetary stories. Earth is a beautiful contradiction: At once a multitude of different worlds and just one evolutionary trajectory of an inhabited planet. Planetary scientist Jonathan Lunine captures this sentiment poetically in “Astrobiology: A Multi-Disciplinary Approach”:\"The Danish prince Hamlet, in Shakespeare’s play of that name, admonished his friend Horatio: 'There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.' Today we might instead warn ourselves of the likelihood that there are more kinds of Earths in the heavens than are dreamt of in astrobiology.\"Although many exoplanet scientists describe their work as a search for “Earth 2.0,” I find this phrase extremely misleading. “Earth 2.0” conjures images of a literal copy of the Earth. But we’re not looking for an escape hatch after we’ve trashed version 1.0.What, then, are we searching for? In truth, “Earth 2.0” is not a place, but a revised concept of what an Earth-like planet is, and what it might mean to find one.Earth-Like As RelationalWhen you read the term “Earth-like planet,” what do you see in your mind’s eye?An astronomer might see a planet with a certain mass, radius and density. A geoscientist might care more about the planet’s interior structure, its tectonic state and its mineralogy. An astrobiologist might be very concerned about whether it has held onto an atmosphere and supports a liquid water ocean. A biogeochemist might say it’s not an Earth-like planet unless it has a thriving biosphere. All of the above define Earth-likeness via intrinsic properties: The planet must have this and must be like that. But what if Earth is better described by its relational properties? Investigating how planets and their biospheres coevolve helps us understand living worlds as intricate webs of connections and interactions — and the role we play within it.The suggestion that relational properties could be important to Earth-likeness is hardly radical, considering that the International Astronomical Union’s 2006 definition of a planet contains two relational criteria and just one intrinsic criterion. First, a planet must be in hydrostatic equilibrium, meaning it has enough self-gravity to pull itself into a fairly round shape; this intrinsic criterion rules out small, irregularly shaped bodies like asteroids and comets. Second, a planet must orbit the Sun; this relational stipulation rules out moons. Third, a planet must be gravitationally dominant in its neighborhood; this relational provision is why Pluto no longer qualifies. Even the ancient Greeks identified planets as heavenly bodies wandering the night sky relative to fixed stars in the background. That’s a relational criterion, too. \"Hunting for another Earth means searching for many different things. Earth has been many planets throughout its 4.6-billion-year history.\" In relational terms, Earth-likeness could be defined by the existence of ecologies of systems within the planet itself that interact with each other in self-promoting ways. For example, the water cycle, plate tectonics, its core-powered magnetic field and carbonate–silicate weathering feedback loop are all intricately intertwined through complex causal couplings. Water lubricates fault planes and lowers the viscosity of rocks and may play a crucial role in maintaining plate tectonics on Earth. Because plate tectonics expedites heat loss from the planetary interior, it may contribute to maintaining the vigorous core convection required to sustain a terrestrial planet’s magnetic dynamo. The dynamo produces a global magnetic field that can shield the planet’s atmosphere from erosion via solar wind, helping a planet retain its atmosphere. Finally, the atmosphere serves to buffer the planet’s surface temperature through the carbonate–silicate weathering cycle so that the water cycle can persist. Together, Earth’s planetary processes have conspired to maintain its activities. They function in concert as a dynamically persisting network of interactions. In this framework, we might see life as something that emerges on the planet, intertwining with its environment in a self-promoting feedback cycle. A good example of this involution is the little-known connection between temperature regulation and woolly mammoths.During the last ice age, woolly mammoths roamed Earth’s northern reaches, including the region of the world we now call Siberia. Through their grazing, they cycled nutrients that promoted the replacement of forests with Arctic grasslands. Their stomping also compacted freshly fallen snow into a stable permafrost, which persisted even in the summer months thanks to the insulation provided by the grasslands. Arctic grasslands efficiently sequestered carbon from the atmosphere, and the permafrost reflected solar radiation back to space. Thus, some researchers think that mammoths played an essential role in maintaining the tundra. Through their interactions with the environment, they effectively maintained a cool climate — conditions in which they thrived.Until, of course, we came along. Although early humans were probably not the sole reason why woolly mammoths and other large steppe animals went extinct, hunting played a large part in their demise. Without the mammoths to graze and stomp, the Arctic’s grasslands and permafrost began to shrink. When land absorbs more radiation and captures less carbon dioxide, runaway feedback exacerbates rising temperatures. Today, the warming of the Arctic tundra could release disastrous amounts of carbon — frozen in its shallow subsurface for millennia — into the atmosphere. It has already started. Although climate change is generally concerned with the past 300 or so years of industrial activity, humans began to profoundly affect Earth’s climate many thousands of years ago. For this reason, some argue that the Anthropocene — a proposed new geologic period defined by our species’ emergence as a global force — should not be demarcated by the onset of fossil fuel burning, the isotopic variances induced by nuclear weapons testing or the plastics that will inevitably gum up the rock record, but by one of our earliest influences on Earth’s climate via contributing to the eradication of gentle giants like woolly mammoths.Modern science has allowed us to better understand how far-reaching the consequences of our actions can be. Science not only develops the instruments we need to peer into the cosmos, but it also creates the tools we require to diagnose more down-to-Earth matters. Many of the satellites we launch into space look back at Earth, monitoring our weather and climate. Even certain telescopes, perched atop Earth’s mountain peaks for the astronomical benefits of rarefied air, are pointed downward to study changes in our own atmosphere. These technologies of perception grant our world a degree of “planetary sapience” — a kind of self-knowing that is unique, as far as we can tell, to Earth. The same principles that allow us to hunt for alien Earths also allow us to comprehend the biosphere as a planetary phenomenon. We are the part of Earth that has learned to understand itself.Climate Connections To A Cosmic ConundrumAs myriad ecological crises unfold around us, one question plagues me: Will we be able to reorient toward planetary homeostasis in time? One might think this concern, which fits squarely in the realm of climate research, Earth systems science and environmental policy, has little to do with my work as an astrobiologist. But it is extremely relevant to the search for life elsewhere. \"We are the part of Earth that has learned to understand itself.\" After all, one thing we astrobiologists want to know is, Where is everybody? Known as the “Fermi Paradox” after the physicist Enrico Fermi, who famously posed the question to his colleagues over lunch one day in 1950, it is a conundrum that reflects the apparent tension between the conspicuous absence of intelligent life in space and a universe that appears amenable to its origin and evolution.One answer to the Fermi Paradox is that what we call “intelligent life” isn’t really that intelligent at all. There’s a humorous take on the habitable zone drawn by space artist Jon Lomberg that depicts Venus, Earth and Mars orbiting the Sun. Venus is labeled “too hot.” Mars is “too cold.” And Earth? “Too dumb.” The comic suggests that while oases for civilized life may be common, civilizations themselves may be too inept to persist.Whether Lomberg’s depiction represents reality has profound consequences for the number of alien civilizations we should expect to exist out there. In 1961, astrophysicist Frank Drake developed a simple equation to estimate the number of intelligent, transmitting civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. Some of its terms — like the rate of star formation and the fraction of stars with planetary systems — are quantifiable thanks to modern astronomy. Other parameters — those dealing with the emergence and evolution of life — are far more uncertain. The final parameter for the Drake equation is the lifetime of technological civilizations that release detectable signals of their existence into space (L) — do they typically exist for a mere blip, multiple millennia or a geologic age? This last variable has the potential to sway our results from astrobio-pessimism to a universe teeming with cosmic pen pals, or vice versa. A few years ago, my colleague Stuart Bartlett and I argued in a paper that this L variable is likely a bimodal distribution, like a camel’s double-humped back. There is likely to be one pileup of civilizations that don’t last very long — those that were “too dumb” — and a second pileup of civilizations that somehow figured it out, so to speak. Those civilizations that figure it out are likely the ones that come to understand that they are an integral part of nature. Modern society instills in us a kind of human exceptionalism, the belief that we are separate from and above nature. We tend to think that we can extract whatever we want from nature, that civilization is born from the ability to force the wilderness into submission. But the more we listen to science, the more we realize how intimately entangled we are within the natural world. We are connected by the generative threads of cosmic evolution to nebulae and stars and the Big Bang itself. We are Earthlings — much like the mantis shrimp, giant sequoia and the Himalayas. Yes, humans exert a profound influence on the rest of this ecological web, but the harm we inflict on our environments will come back to bite us.When we awaken to the reality of our deep entwinement with the rest of nature’s forces, we might consider revising the Arthur C. Clarkeism that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic” to “any sufficiently advanced civilization is indistinguishable from nature.” Doing so could completely revise our search for advanced life, which is largely based on the search for alien technology. But conflating intelligence and technology is an assumption worth challenging. True intelligence may know not to use the technologies we so dearly cling to as we plumb our planet’s riches to exhaustion.The modus operandi that has brought us to the brink of nuclear annihilation and plunged us into a global climate crisis may not be a recipe for cosmic longevity. Instead, the next phase of a civilization’s evolution might require a radical adjustment toward prioritizing planetary homeostasis. If so, then perhaps a thriving Earth-like world is unlikely to spawn a galactic empire that colonizes other worlds or exhibits anything like the extractive and greedy imperialism seen in a small range of human cultures over the last 500 years or even longer.Fermi’s question presents itself as a paradox only under the implicit assumption that the future is a linear extension of past and current trends. But science teaches us that evolutionary history is rife with major transitions to brand-new states of being: eukaryogenesis, multicellularity, sociality. Perhaps self-awareness-driven reprioritization toward planetary homeostasis may be the next transcendence that life takes (or must take) after civilization as we know it. Perhaps the Fermi paradox is not really a question of “where is everybody?” but “what is everybody now?” \"Perhaps the Fermi paradox is not really a question of 'where is everybody?' but 'what is everybody now?'\" Becoming & BelongingThe most brilliant night sky I’ve ever seen was on a backpacking trip in the Grand Canyon. Shielded by the canyon walls, there was hardly a trace of light pollution. You could see the Milky Way stretch across from one side of the canyon to the other; even Andromeda, our neighboring spiral galaxy, was visible to the naked eye. Seeing the universe in its full glory was, as novelist Sherry Thomas once put it, like witnessing “a diamond heist gone awry.”Gazing upward, I couldn’t help but be reminded of how much there is to learn from asking questions of the cosmos and our place within it. Astrobiology teaches us about our strengths, which derive from relationships that are both obvious and subtle. It teaches us about our fragility — just around 62 miles of air separates us from the blackness of space. From it, we learn more about where we came from — our humble beginnings as single-celled organisms swimming in Earth’s early oceans — and who we are, whether incessant explorers, persistent dreamers or inevitable storytellers. Astrobiology teaches us about our planetary belonging — Earth is our home, a pale blue dot that serves as our perch for peering into the cosmos.But above all this, the study of the stars tells us who we must become. Searching for alien life is not an activity that yields instant gratification. It may take centuries, or even millennia, to find what we’re looking for — and millennia more to hold any meaningful conversation with whatever intelligences exist. But to give ourselves the best chance of finding alien life, we must become a long-lived civilization ourselves. We must become the hope we wish to see in the cosmos.

      "content": "This post is public so feel free to share it.ShareFacebook memories informed me this morning that two years ago today I posted (along with some cat pictures):Just finished volunteer training, after hanging out with Ayla and Zuzu. I'm now no longer a frequent guest at Almost Home Cat Rescue, but also officially a volunteer!I knew that this anniversary was coming up soon. Frankly, I was a little bit surprised that it hadn't already arrived in June (it looks like I misremembered dates a bit). But it is good to know that as of today, I am officially two years in.Most of the matters I write about here in my Substack are directly related to philosophy, broadly speaking, but you have likely seen me occasionally posting here in Notes about cats and kittens, the Almost Home shelter and organizations, and my own departed cat companion Sassy. Today's entry will be very much about the latter matters and probably not much at all about philosophy. So if you're here exclusively for philosophy-related matters, you might want to move on to one of the many other pieces that will fit that bill better.I will say this, however (and this is something I do intend to write more about down the line): It's my view that, in general, it's a good thing for people who are particularly interested in philosophy, and who spend a lot of their time and thought on it, to not center everything in their lives in philosophy. In my case, my interest in classic heavy metal music is something I can enjoy without shoehorning philosophy into it. I can enjoy a good walk or hike and appreciate the summer flowers without needing to indulge in reveries about aesthetics. And when it comes to engagements with cats and kittens, it's fine for that to be disconnected from the philosophical work I do. Back to Almost Home. How did I end up there? That's a rather long story, and it starts with the Sassy cat, and the end of her long life in 2022. Sassy was one of two kittens who had survived an apartment fire in New York City that killed their mother and their littermates. My now-wife Andi adopted them from a shelter when they were young, and she was told that Sassy's sister, Teensy, would likely be all right, but that Sassy probably did not have a long life ahead of her. As it turned out, Sassy outlived not only her sister but also her two canine adoptive siblings, Magnus and Amica.When Andi and I reconnected (we first met back in high school — another long story there!), and we became involved, I met all of her four-legged family. Sassy and I became friends immediately. While Teensy hib behind a box, Sassy strutted out to me, nuzzled my hand, purred, and let me pick her right up into my arms. Once I moved in, Teensy warmed up to me, and the dogs and I had gotten close as well. But with Sassy over the years, I formed the deepest connection I have had with any animal over the course of my life.When we moved back out here to Milwaukee from New York, Sassy rode with me on the rather ill-fated trip, which saw our truck break down along the way, and Sassy riding with me in a semi tow truck. She and I spent a lot of time together over the years, especially as the other members of our pack got old and died off, leaving her at the end the only one left. Without understanding the reason for it, Sassy, I think, was very happy with the Covid-19 lockdown era, since it meant that, other than taking walks, and later on going back to the gym and teaching on campus at MIAD and Marquette, I was home with her all the time.Sometime along the way, I became \"her person\". It's not as if Sassy didn't love Andi, who raised her from a kitten, but she had a special connection with me. Apparently, when I would leave the apartment, and Sassy realized I was gone, she would wander around seeking me out, making a specific cry she used only when calling for me. She slept next to me most nights, sometimes pushing with her head to arrange my hands and arms into a configuration that suited her. She spent a lot of time in my lap or in my arms, expected a little \"taste\" of what I was eating (she went wild over Ashley's fried catfish and over plain tuna sushi!), and would walk me down the stairs in the morning, making sure I followed her down by looking over her shoulder and occasionally chirping at me.Sassy lived to 19 1/2, and while she was never in great health — there were always some things she struggled with — she was almost always in good spirits. She loved trips out to her grandmother's house in Brookfield, where she would explore the yard, hiding under the hostas, scratching and sniffing around the old logs in the woodpile. We also took walks around town with her tucked into in a harness across my chest, and she loved not just smelling the air, but watching the rippling waves of the Milwaukee river, and greeting the people we came across. She even accompanied us on a road trip up to Green Bay the Christmas before she died, and charmed the hotel maintenance guy who fixed the hot water in our room when we were at the Packers game.Andi said a number of times, after Amica died, and only Sassy was left, seeing the two of us spending time together: \"It's going to be really hard for you when she goes\". And it was, of course. Sassy was nearing the end, and stopped cleaning herself, or even sometimes getting down from her bed to use the litter box, so I cleaned her, her bed, and the butterscotch blanket she loved frequently. In her last few days, she was unable to keep food down, and then broth, and then even water. I cancelled all of my classes and appointments, and just spent her last three days with her, mostly holding her in my arms, or laying her on my chest. She died at home with us. I still feel some twinges of grief remembering her tiny frame and face at the end, but I'm happy that we were able to give her a decent final few days with the people who loved her and she loved.After Sassy died, some well-meaning but rather tactless people suggested that I should deal with the grief for a beloved companion by just replacing her. \"Get a new kitten\", they urged. That was the opposite of what I intended to do. Andi and I had talked this over quite a bit. She had spent nearly two decades caring for her four-legged family, she was still grieving the loss of both dogs from years past, and it was time for us to be freed of caretaking obligations for a while. I had thought that, once my grief had mellowed, what I wanted to do was to volunteer at some sort of rescue or shelter to help care for cats and kittens, to give some love, affection, care, and attention to animals that needed it.That idea went on hold for a while, not least because I had a lot to process in terms of my own grieving, but also because not long after Sassy died, I came down with Covid, which did a number on me. In some respects, as Andi pointed out, it was fortunate that Sassy was gone when I got Covid, since she would have been upset not being able to spend time with me for the 2 weeks I was seriously ill and isolated. Then, in the summer of 2022, we took a trip back up to Green Bay, this time to attend a soccer game at Lambeau Field. While up in Green Bay, after having breakfast in the downtown, we walked past a cat shelter, Safe Haven Pet Sanctuary. I initially didn't want to go in, but Andi suggested as we were walking past it the second time, that we do so. And we did. We got to meet a retired man, \"Grandpa Terry\", who spends a lot of his time with the cats there, sometimes just taking naps, and he introduced me to an old girl, Agnes, who was terminally ill with cancer. She got up in my lap, and I petted her until she fell asleep for about an hour. Then we said our goodbyes and went off to the game.Later on that summer, for my birthday, we decided to visit the local cat cafe here in Milwaukee. That experience was all right, but something quite different from the visit to Safe Haven. You book an hour to spend with the cats, in a single room with lots of other people, including kids who stress some of the cats out a bit, and there's about as many people as there are cats. Not quite the same model as a cat shelter or rescue that doesn't focus on the \"cafe\" aspect.And then came Almost Home. I saw an article about them a few months after they had officially opened their shelter space to the public in late 2022 (before that, they had the foster network, but not a physical location), and noticed that they were located in a building I had previously worked in, when what is now a veterinarian office was a coffee house. Better yet, they were right off one of the stops of the streetcar that I rode pretty frequently. So one Sunday in February 2023, Andi and I visited Almost Home.At that time, there were just two cats living in the shelter, a playful little black cat named Ernest, and a beautiful but at-first shy calico named Maxine. Both of them had FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus), so they couldn't be with other cats, since they might spread the infection to them. Stephen was the volunteer who was staffing the shelter, and he explained about the shelter, their mission, and these two particular cats. I made friends with Earnest right away, and Maxine warmed up to me after I spent time quietly sitting with her and petting her. Andi and I visited several times, but as it turned out, what had always been a mild allergy for her while she had Teensy and Sassy, in the absence of exposure to cats since Sassy died, had developed into a much stronger allergy. Spending time at the shelter wasn't much of an option for her, but she encouraged me to do so, and I became a regular visitor.After some time, I met other volunteers there, as well as getting to know other cats and kittens who came in. Ernest and Maxine got adopted together. Stephen started suggesting to me that I consider becoming a volunteer, and told me more about the organization. I was pretty busy during the academic Spring semester, but decided that once the school year was done, I would submit the volunteer application and go through the training involved.At that time, that involved going through an online class with Fear Free, going to an orientation to all the ins and outs of the shelter with one of the experienced volunteers, and then doing several shadow shifts with volunteers (and if I remember right, a background check as well). So I completed all of that officially two years ago, and then I began signing up for shifts.Every day there are morning and evening cleaning, feeding, and watering shifts, where volunteers come in, do those things, and spend time with the cats and kittens. Four days a week, we have open house shifts (Tuesday and Thursday evenings from 6-8 PM, and Saturday and Sunday 10 AM-2 PM) where members of the public come in to meet and spend time with the shelter residents). I started doing regular open house shifts and occasional cleaning shifts (particularly on holidays), and got to see how things were done by spending time with and talking with the more seasoned volunteers, some of whom were actually founders of Almost Home.As time has gone on, I've been asked to help with additional matters at the shelter. Some of the other volunteers, seeing that I bring a calming presence for cats who are stressed, anxious, or otherwise withdrawn, getting them to relax and come out of their proverbial shells, started calling me a \"cat whisperer\", and so when a transfer of cats new to the shelter come in, I get asked to help out with just welcoming and spending time with them. Very occasionally I help with events to promote the shelter to the public. I've also very recently taken on a new role, vice president of the board, and I'm just in my early months of that.In the meantime, we've had hundreds of cats pass through the shelter and the foster network, staying with us, getting excellent care and the love they need, until they are adopted into their \"forever homes\". You do get attached to some of them over time, but it is not just a consolation but our very mission that they're not supposed to remain with us forever, but rather find their permanent people. I haven't looked at our count-sign lately, but I think we passed 525 total adoptions sometime last week.Almost Home Cat Rescue is both a place and an organization. You could also say that it includes at any given time a number of cats and kittens as well. But what really makes it what it is are the volunteers, people who choose to give of their time, energy, labor, and love to care for the cats and kittens that are with us for a while and then move on to a good life with other people who will love and care for them. It has become something quite central and important in my life. And I like to think that my work with Almost Home is a way for me to continue and honor what I was fortunate enough to have with Sassy for roughly 12 years.Gregory B.

      "content": "A week or two ago, a producer for the New York Times' very popular tech podcast Hard Fork reached out and asked if I'd submit a short critique of the show. The hosts, Casey Newton, a veteran tech journalist who runs the newsletter Platformer, and Kevin Roose, the Times' tech columnist, are often criticized for their, let's say, bullish coverage of AI, and the plan was to do a segment where they addressed some of their critics' concerns. I've reached out to Kevin and Casey before, and encouraged them to host more voices critical of AI—as you'll hear in the snippet, Kevin joked that he'd only do it if I let him give me a cattle brand that read FEEL THE AGI. (I agreed on the condition that I get to do the same with one that said THE LUDDITES WERE RIGHT.) Maybe that was part of the impetus for this segment, who knows! Interestingly, the producer opens by noting that she feels increasingly alienated from the optimistic vision of AI aired on the show, and was thus moved to push for a segment that puts them in dialogue with more skeptical views. Regardless, it was of course a little bit of a trap; critics were asked to record one-minute segments, while the hosts got as long as they needed in their response. It wouldn't be live, and there would be no opportunity for rebuttals or clarifications; critics wouldn't be able to defend themselves or their positions. The critique I recorded and sent in was closer to two minutes, and it got edited down to maybe less than half that. Not in a way that totally distorted the substance or anything, but it did leave out what I consider some key points as well as some of the blunter criticisms. (And even after the editing mine was presented as the \"most forceful\" critique!)Blood in the Machine is a 100% independent publication made possible entirely by readers like you. If you find value in this work, and you're able, consider upgrading to a paid subscription.I knew that all of the above was going to or likely to happen and I still decided to participate, because I do think it's important to get more critical perspectives about AI on big, influential mainstream shows like Hard Fork. Plus obviously I like to yell about this stuff. But I wanted to try to challenge the hosts and their audience, in a respectful way that invited substantive response, and would, you know, actually make it to the air. So I focused my question on AGI—the idea that OpenAI or one of the other tech companies or labs is close to building an artificial general intelligence that can replace most people's jobs. It's a framework that's not always referenced directly on Hard Fork, but is an assumption that sits central to its approach to AI coverage. Here's how it appeared when the show aired last Friday: Hello, gentlemen. This is Brian Merchant. I'm a tech journalist and author of the book and newsletter, \"Blood in the Machine.\" And first of all, I want to say that I still want a whole show about the Luddites and why they were right. And I think it's only fair, because Kevin recently threatened to stick me with a cattle brand that says \"Feel the AGI,\" which brings me to my concern.How are you feeling about feeling the AGI right now? Because I worry that this narrative that presents super powerful corporate AI products as inevitable is doing your listeners a disservice. Using the AGI language and frameworks preferred by the AI companies does seem to suggest that you're aligning with their vision and risks promoting their product roadmap outright.So when you say, as my future cattle brand reads, that you \"feel the AGI,\" do you worry that you're serving this broader sales pitch, encouraging execs and management to embrace AI, often at the expense of working people? OK, thanks, fellas.For reference, I'll throw the full text of my submitted comment in the footnotes here.1 The most important omitted bits included a citation of OpenAI's specific corporate definition of AGI, and the following:VCs, Softbank and big tech are not investing historic amounts of money in this technology because they think it might solve climate change—investors care about the prospect of automating tasks and labor at unprecedented scale. They want new kinds of surveillance, ways to dodge accountability, and dirt cheap content creation.A key part of my critique is that by advancing the AGI framework, and calling it that, you risk not only materially advancing OpenAI's interests, but providing cover for all of the short-term harms AI companies are packaging up in their software automation products right now. But I digress. Perhaps the cuts were made for time, or to keep the question focused and more answerable, or to reduce the fury of the hosts, or who knows why, but regardless this is the kind of thing that happens when you're producing radio shows and podcasts and I do not hold it against anyone. I also want to give credit where it's due—Casey and Kevin gave the question a sincere and considered response, and did not just laugh anything off or shit on me while I was not in the room to push back. They presented the response I mostly anticipated I'd get, which boils down to the fact that regardless of whether or not AGI is an industry construct, they both, to varying degrees, believe that such a phenomenon is on the horizon, and that accepting as much is crucial if we are to understand and prepare for the disruptions AGI will engender. There are a few things that I do want to respond to, so I'll excerpt from their comments at length here:Casey NewtonYeah, I mean, I think Brian's question is a good one, and I understand what he's saying when he says, look, AGI is an industry term. If you come on your show every week and talk about it, you wind up sounding like you're just sort of amplifying the industry voice, maybe at the expense of other voices.I think this is just a tricky thing to navigate. Because, as you said, Kevin, you look at the rate of progress in these systems, and it is exponential. And it does seem like it is important to extrapolate out to as far as you can go and start asking yourself, what kind of world are we going to be living in then?I think a reason that both of us do that is that we do see so many obvious harms that will come from that world, starting with labor automation, which I know is a huge concern of Brian's, and which we talk about all the time on this show as maybe one of the primary near-term risks of AI.So I want to think a bit more about what we can do to signal to folks that we are not just here to amplify the industry voice. But I think the answer to Brian's question of, why talk about AGI like it's likely to happen, is that in one form or another, I think both of us just do think we are likely to get powerful systems that can automate a lot of labor.Kevin RooseYes.Casey NewtonAnd we would like to explore the consequences of such a world.Kevin RooseTotally. And I think it's actually beneficial for workers to understand the trajectory that these systems are on. They need to know what's happening and what the executives at these companies are saying about the labor-replacing potential of this technology. I actually read Brian's book about the Luddites. I thought it was great.And I think it's very instructive that the Luddites were not in denial about the power of the technology that was challenging their jobs. They didn't look at these automated weaving machines and go, oh, that'll never get more powerful, that'll never be able to replace us, look at all the stupid mistakes it's making. They sensed, correctly, that this technology was going to be very useful and allow factories to produce goods much more efficiently. And they said, we don't like that. We don't like where this is headed. They were able to project out into the future that they would struggle to compete in that world and take steps to fight against it. So I like to think that if \"Hard Fork\" had existed in the 1800s, we would have been sort of encouraging people to wake up to the increasing potential automation caused by these factory machines. And I think that's what we're doing today.To Casey, I'd say thanks for taking the note seriously, and I'm glad to hear you'll be thinking about whether and how the industry voice is getting over-amplified on the show, perhaps cracking the door for more non-industry voices (not just critics, ofc) too. To Kevin, thanks for the thoughts, and for bringing in the historical context of the Luddites—and for reading the book! But I do have to push some oversized spectacles up the bridge of my nose and say \"well actually\" because the last comment I excerpted above is a bit of a mischaracterization of what happened with the Luddites. And I want to address it because I think it cuts to the core of much of our debate over AGI, too.I understand what Kevin is getting at, that unlike many critics and AI opponents today, who doubt AGI will ever be as powerful as the AI companies say it will, Luddites recognized the widespread threat to their livelihoods and acted accordingly. But there's one important distinction: The Luddites were not concerned primarily with the power of the technology, but rather the people—the bosses, the factory owners—using it against them. What the Luddites feared and protested was entirely of the human-made variety: labor exploitation. The Luddites were fighting bosses using power looms and wide frames as a justification for driving down wages, building factories and pushing workers into them, forcing them to sacrifice their autonomy, to \"stand at their command.\" The Luddites were not in denial about the technology's power because it was quite clear where that power was derived from, which was the industrialists who owned it. That's who they organized against, not the technology itself. That's why Luddites wrote letters to factory owners excoriating them for degrading labor conditions and taking work away from weavers, and exhorting them to stop using the \"obnoxious\" machines, and threatening them with sabotage if they didn't. It's why Luddites like Gravener Henson spent their daylight hours petitioning Parliament and agitating for worker protections and labor rights. Not because machines were too powerful, but because they were often being used by unscrupulous men in exploitative ways like facilitating child labor and driving down industry standards.In fact, the Luddites did say, quite loudly, look at these stupid machines and all the mistakes they're making. This was one of their chief complaints, that the mechanized looms and wide frames produced low-quality \"fraudulent\" goods that drove down prices and ruined whole cloth-producing towns' reputations. They also said that those machines could never adequately replace them. And they were right! To this day, our clothes are made not by autonomous machinery, but by workers around the world, often in countries with cheaper labor markets. The automation of the industrial revolution did not abolish weavers or knitters; it helped bosses deskill them, break their labor power, and immiserate them. Eventually, it dispersed the supply chain of cloth production further around the globe. It did facilitate a broad and lasting change; that there would be more and cheaper cloth, produced by workers who were paid much less, at the benefit of a relative handful of industrialists and capitalists. (There's a justified fear that a similar pattern will play out today, with creative workers not disappearing, but having their working conditions and pay crushed by managers turning to AI for writing, art, and music.)This is why I'm so critical of the AGI/mass automation story. If we're worried about the ill impacts on labor, the first place we need to look is at the people who will control and profit from the technology. And such warnings about mass job loss have been issued throughout history, typically by the upper classes, and have not yet materialized. The closest thing the Industrial Revolution had to an AGI story was not told (nor feared) by the Luddites, but the proto-computer inventor Charles Babbage and the business theorist Andrew Ure. These men predicted that fully automated factories were incoming that would put an end to human labor altogether—a prediction made on behalf of the factory owners, with whom both men sympathized, at a time when factories were falling under public disfavor due to their brutal working conditions.For another thing, AGI is a story that seems to accept as ordained a subjugated hierarchy of labor. If Hard Fork had existed in the 1800s (or perhaps the 1700s, when the mechanized machinery was still in more sporadic use), it would indeed be great if it had been able to warn people not merely that very powerful new technologies are coming, or to brace for inevitable job loss and automation; but that new technologies are coming, and that elites are going to use them to justify a regime of production predicated on low wage work, child labor, brutal working conditions, and so on. After all, this was not inevitable! Entirely other social formations were (and are still) possible! That's what the Luddites were fighting for—a future that was not enclosed by the factory. A future where working people shared the fruits of productive technologies, had a say in their deployment, and did not have to accept as determined an arrangement where factory owners had power over them to set the terms.This is the crux of the issue, I think. Presenting AGI as inevitable or elemental lets AI CEOs and the c-suite execs buying their enterprise contracts off the hook for what is actually a series of human decisions—decisions ultimately aimed at increasing profits, or attracting more investment, usually at the expense of workers. It cedes control of the narrative to the owners and profiteers of this technology, and empowers their efforts to sell more automation and surveillance software. As I mention in my unedited critique, I think that accepting AGI on industry terms prevents us from really interrogating who the AGI story serves. Near the end of my bit, Casey made a comment that I think drives home many of these points. He says that he \"would just love to see the leftist labor movement work on AI tools that can replace managers. You know? It's like, right now, it feels like all of this is coming from the top down, but there could be a sort of AI that would work from the bottom up.\" Indeed, I'm sure there are many people, leftists and conservatives alike, who would like to see their managers replaced with an AI. Or better yet, eliminated altogether. And if there's any job an AI can do well right now, it is one whose design is to efficiently allocate resources, surveil workforces, and summarize output—in other words, AI could absolutely replace management. But replacing management with AI is of course not simply a matter of coding a capable managerial AI. Who would approve and facilitate the automation of management, after all? Certainly not managers themselves! Not without an old-fashioned struggle, anyway.As with any automation technology, the question of who benefits from AI and who is harmed is ultimately a question of power. Who has the power to impose or refuse automation, and who profits from its use? The AGI story obscures those power relations, and allows it to concentrate, with minimal challenge, in the hands of those telling it—the modern day factory bosses hoping to use automation to slash labor costs and bring workers to heel. OK OK OK. Longtime readers of this newsletter know I can go on and on about the Luddites, as I think I have ably demonstrated here today. So! I'll leave it here for now. While I'd still love to have a more robust back and forth about AGI, the state of AI, and its historical context with regards to labor automation with Casey and Kevin, they certainly did not have to do a segment hearing out their critics at all. I do appreciate their airing my criticism and responding in kind, and will look forward to continuing the conversation.

First of all, I still want a whole show about the luddites and why they were right, and I think it's only fair since Kevin recently threatened to stick me with a cattle brand that says FEEL THE AGI.Which brings us to my concern: How are you feeling about feeling the AGI right now? Because I think that this narrative that presents super-powerful corporate AI products as inevitable, is doing your listeners a disservice.I think it's one thing to discuss how impressive technology is being developed and sold, but using the AGI language and frameworks preferred by the AI companies seems to suggest that you're aligning with their vision, and risks promoting their product roadmap outright.AGI, after all, is defined by OpenAI as \"highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.\"And VCs, Softbank and big tech are not investing historic amounts of money in this technology because they think it might solve climate change—investors care about the prospect of automating tasks and labor at unprecedented scale. They want new kinds of surveillance, ways to dodge accountability, and dirt cheap content creation.When you say, as my future cattle brand reads, you Feel the AGI, do you worry that you're serving this broader sales pitch? Encouraging execs and management to embrace AI, often at the expense of working people?I worry that the AI companies' story — that AGI is in the imminent future — is helping them concentrate power and perpetrate abuses in the present.I worry that by predicting this future on big tech's terms, you're helping to spread the AI industry's vision of AGI — when you two are in fact better positioned than nearly anyone to interrogate who that vision really serves.Thanks fellas, I'll take my brand now.",

Feel free to drop your answers in the comments.#1Dennard scaling enabled more transistors on a chip as gate length got smaller, but without increasing power density. But one parameter — fundamentally limited by thermal physics — refused to scale, setting a hard stop around 2005. Robert Dennard warned about this in his original paper, and how it would eventually spell the death of Dennard scaling. What is this parameter?#2According to its founder, Lee Byung-Chul, the name of this company means 'three stars' and began as a trading company in 1938. Since the 90s, it has evolved into a powerhouse with stakes in semiconductors, consumer electronics, insurance, and even food processing. It recently struck a massive deal involving $16.5B with Tesla. What company am I talking about?#3Used for growing single-crystal silicon, this method sounds almost like a ballet; slow pulling, precise rotation, and heat control are key. But beneath the elegance lies a flaw: if too much oxygen sneaks in, minority carrier lifetimes are degraded. What is this method called?#4As gigawatt-class datacenters push towards higher DC voltages to boost efficiency, they flirt with a deadly risk: a breakdown of insulation that doesn't just short — it detonates. We're talking temperatures of 20,000°C — three times the sun's surface temperature, vaporizing metal and unleashing explosive force.

      "content": "Could the United States had followed Germany and France down the path to fascism in the 1930s? Consider the dark logic of Lawrence Dennis, the failures of liberal reform, and the contingent heroism that kept America on a different course. The 1930s were a hinge in world history, and Lawrence Dennis was the Cassandra of American collapse. His warnings, his authoritarian prescriptions, and the counterfactuals of FDR's survival all force us to ask: how close did we come to the abyss?...ShareShare Brad DeLong's Grasping RealityThis AM the very sharp Zack Beauchamp gets into the WAYBACK machine and gives us a tour back to 1935, and the extremely interesting Lawrence Dennis. He was a brilliant and deeply complicated figure, who diagnosed the Great Depression as the death knell of liberal capitalism and offered a chillingly candid blueprint for American fascist reform, critiquing parliamentary drift, calling for antrammeled unitary technocratic executive, envisioning a \"middle-class revolution\" that would subordinate property and liberty to the needs of the state. Consider the failures of German and French social democracy, the near-misses of American history in 1933, and the ever-present temptation of the engineer-dictator. I think we need to take Lawrence Dennis at least as seriously now as people did then. Dennis then saw only three possible futures for America: communism, chaos, or authoritarian reorganization. Reading Dennis makes us confront the limits of pluralism, the dangers of elite despair, and the persistent allure of strongman solutions in times of economic and political breakdown. For the 1930s were a crucible for democracy, and Lawrence Dennis was its most unsettling American prophet.I still have my Dennis notes from Slouching Towards Utopia here on my hard disk!Even though not a single word about Dennis made it into the final book!So let me drag my notes out!Now let me dust them off:Lawrence Dennis (1893–1977) was raised in Atlanta as an evangelical child prodigy—he was preaching sermons before he was ten. He went on to Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard, served as a captain commanding a military police company in France and World War I, and held posts in the U.S. diplomatic service in Central America. He quit the diplomatic service because he objected to the U.S.'s opposition to the Sandanistas.In the 1930s,, surveying the wreckage of the Great Depression, he concluded that liberal capitalism was not merely ailing but terminal. Dennis became the country's foremost homegrown theorist of fascism, arguing—first in The Coming American Fascism (1936), then in The Dynamics of War and Revolution (1940)—that the United States required a centralized, technocratic state to manage its economic affairs, and that the old verities of constitutional government and individual rights were, at best, quaint relics of the eighteenth century. Put on trial for sedition during World War II (the judge died of a heart attack, and the new judge declared a mistrial), Dennis spent his later years as a consultant and writer, largely shunned by polite society. That he was also Black \"passing\"—itself a thing that is a very weird facet of American one-drop anti-Black racism—added yet another layer to the life of an already very complicated manDennis back in 1935 saw three and only paths for America going forward: Soviet Union-style communism, chaos,fascism.But why? Why couldn't the system that had developed and worked moderately well in western Europe from 1849 to 1914 and in the United States from 1865 to 1929—the Belle Époque-Gilded Age pseudo-classical semi-liberal order—have been raised from the briny deep, put into drydock, structurally repaired, given a fresh coat of paint, and sent back out to sea? Because, Dennis explained, the liberal capitalist system simply could not be sustained:Lawrence Dennis (1935): Fascism for America <https://sci-hub.se/https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000271623518000110>: 'Fascis[m is]... the inevitable alternative to chaos or communism.... 'The orderly processes of the liberal capitalist system call for adjustment of the financial difficulties through bankruptcy, mortgage foreclosures—putting the country through the legal wringer... adjustment of market, price, and wage[s]... without Government subsidy to production curtailment or to subsistence of the unemployed. There is not a serious-minded man in the country who would long keep his head on if he tried to put the country through the wringer of orderly capitalist readjustment. Therefore I say the system is doomed.... The plea of the conservatives for a return to the Constitution is absurd when the strict enforcement of constitutional property rights would precipitate civil war. Every economic adjustment today rests on Government interventions in new and innumerable forms...Give a gift subscriptionBut couldn't it be reformed to be workable via normal procedures? Dennis thought not. Dennis asked his audience not to delude themselves. People needed to recognize that the endless parade of majority congressional votes—each wrangled from the machinery of procedure, lubricated by organized interest-group pressure, relentless lobbying, and the ceaseless jockeying for re-election among a multitude of anxious officeholders—did not, in aggregate, amount to anything like the necessary steady hand on the wheel of state. Checks-and-balances had Madisonian charm, but was not governance but rather drift, fragmentation, and paralysis. Congress was always be paralyzed by interest-group factions, corrupted by plutocratic money, with representatives cowering in fear of offending some key single-issue voters come the next election. The \"playing politics\" creaking Enlightenment-orrery mechanisms of representatives and votes and courts under liberal governance simply could not deliver the needed goods:Lawrence Dennis (1935): Fascism for America: 'Liberalism cannot achieve a governmental pattern of intervention which can... work... result[ing] mostly from the play of individual and competitive initiatives in a relatively free market... If Mr. Roosevelt is to play politics he cannot increase taxation and lower wages enough to put the unemployed to work.... He therefore rides the dollar toboggan of inflation, and goes on smiling and fishing with the Astors.... A state which has to fight minority group pressures in the electoral campaign and minority economic interests in the courts cannot plan orderly economic processes.... The result of the play of minority and private interests in the electoral and court games is not a conspiracy of welfare but a conspiracy of chaos....Leave a commentAnd this \"toboggan of inflation\" would end in a hyperinflationary crash, followed by, if not fascism, then chaos or communism. And with respect to communism, Dennis said: no thanks, please!:Lawrence Dennis (1935): Fascism for America: 'Of the communist values... most important... is that human welfare demands the liquidation of the élite... a euphemism... being stood up before a Communist firing squad. I find the bourgeoisie of this country too numerous and too strong to be liquidated except in one of the bloodiest and most prolonged civil wars.... I should not like to be liquidated.... The liquidation of so large and useful a group of persons would be a greater loss to the rest of the community than the advantages any dictatorship of triumphant proletarian revolutionary leaders could possibly vouchsafe...Get 50% off a group subscriptionSo what was Dennis's alternative?Lawrence Dennis (1935): Fascism for America: 'The authoritarian scheme... [is] the planning of a central authority, which must always be really a council of persons, charged with this function....

ShareFor under Lawrence's fascism:Lawrence Dennis (1935): Fascism for America: 'A private property right is only a right to do what the state from day to day may decide may be done.... The investor could be assured of his principal... and whatever rate of interest, if any... secure[d] sufficient savings. The manager... could... retain something... as a bonus for efficient and successful management. Ownership and management would lose their present legal rights to win court victories over the state and to obstruct its policies, but in exchange they would derive... security from labor trouble and [ruinous predatory] competitive practices...Share Brad DeLong's Grasping RealityAnd people should not worry about the \"property rights\" of investors. They would remain effectively untouched:Lawrence Dennis (1935): Fascism for America: 'As far as the millions of stockholders, bondholders, depositors, and insured having an interest in corporate affairs are concerned, fascism will not materially modify their rights or liberties, for the very good reason that, as it is, they have de facto no rights or liberties to be modified except the rights to sell their rights of ownership if they can find a buyer and to take what management gives them. These rights will undoubtedly be left to them...Leave a comment\"Fascism\" was thus, for Dennis, at bedrock the end of the false belief that government is founded upon possession of inalienable rights. Rights were damned alienable. Were alienable at government request. For the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one. From the perspective of the courts, the contrast Dennis saw was most stark: Liberalism rested on the proposition that the welfare and security of the individual were best preserved by robust, vigilant courts—what Dennis likes to call \"active and powerful judicial restraints\"—standing ever-ready to check the ambitions of the state and shield private citizens from governmental overreach. Fascism, by contrast, in Dennis's telling, flipped the script: it held that the true guarantor of individual well-being is not the independence of the courts but the vigor, competence, and single-minded purpose of the state apparatus itself—the \"strength, efficiency, and success of the State in the realization of the national plan.\" In short: for the liberal, courts were the bulwark; for the fascist, it was the executive's capacity to deliver on grand designs—to Make America Great Again.And this transformation would not have been seen as a loss:Lawrence Dennis (1935): Fascism for America: 'Individuals who have been beaten by the depression in the free market do not want liberal liberties to do things they cannot as a practical matter do, and liberal liberties for others to do things to them which the others can and actually do, and which the victims do not like to have done to them. The liberal critics of fascism are apt to stress the question of liberty.... The people who want a New Deal or a new system are not entirely enchanted with their present liberties. Liberty is a word to be used by people fighting for something they do not have; it is not a good propaganda word for people to play with who are fighting to keep something they have...Refer a friendAnd if you were a young whippersnapper wanting to rise and have a career, or an old fogey hoping for a comfortable retirement, you needed to get on the train:Lawrence Dennis (1935): Fascism for America: 'IThe élite of the present order can assure their leadership or liberties only by... joining the offensive on the technological problems of social organization and production. The political instrument of government must be directed by an executive council representing a mandate from the people to do a managing job... the end of the parliamentary or congressional system, under which governmental decisions and policies are the results of power group pressures...Give a gift subscriptionThat was Dennis's argument back in 1935. The people would elect a president who would run the executive as a plebiscitary dictator setting goals and directions for the country. Government would be done by councils of smart and capable technocrats telling the big corporations what they needed to do to Make America Great Again. The police would deal politely with anti-American non-public-spirited wannabe John-Galtish recalcitrants, while also providing security from labor trouble and ruinous predatory competitive practices. And all would be as well as it could be—certainly better than Soviet-style communism, or the interest-group court veto-driven paralysis of any attempt to continue the Gilded Age Order.Zack comments this morning:Zack Beauchamp: Fascism for America <https://link.vox.com/view/608adc2191954c3cef02cb34ocrry.dn9/84c0b10c>: 'The Great Depression was proof that liberalism had run its course — its emphasis on free markets and individual liberty unable to cope.... Te only question was whether communism or fascism would win the future. And Dennis was rooting for the latter.... Two central errors in Dennis's work that have direct parallels [today].... The first... is a claim that a recent crisis is a product of unchangeable and unreformable liberal philosophical commitments.... Patrick Deneen... argues that the... rise of... Trump augurs liberalism's collapse... that is, he believes, a necessary product of liberalism's philosophical commitments to meritocracy and individualism... because \"liberalism's conception of liberty created both a new ruling class and degraded the lives of the masses\"...

Right-wing religious regimes have a poor track record when it comes to protecting the rights of non-believers...Get 50% off a group subscriptionWell, yes. Anti-liberal régimes have very poor records indeed—at the very least, records bad enough to make everyone except grifters and the delusionally insane cling to the liberalism of fear. It is not attractive to think of an America in which Adrian Vermeule and his peers cheer on:the hunting-down and imprisoning of users of artificial birth control(because they believe that back in 1968 that then-71 year-old grifter Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini had special insight into the Mind of The One Who Is, binding on all peoples of the world will-they nill-they),and the close scrutinization of every single red-state miscarriage,while trans people are beaten in the streets for the crime of existing, and green-card holders, H1B visa holders, dreamers, and everyone else whose papers are not in perfect order—ahem, Elon Musk; ahem, Melanija Knavs—tread very warily indeed:lest their employers drop a dime the day before payday and have Marco Rubio and Kristi Noem take action and deport them immediately.You say we already have (3) through (6 here in this America today? I guess we do.And as for the inability of the modern avatar of what has descended in the legitimate line from Enlightenment-Era liberalism to reform itself again, that does indeed hang in the balance. I note that we did it in the 1930s: constructed the social-democratic New Deal Order that had a powerful affinity with the mass-production mode of societal organization and that drove the greatest boom generation after World War II that the world had ever seen. Can we do it again? It is in our hands.ShareI will point out that Dennis's judgment in the 1930s that the Belle Époque Order as reconstructed after WWI could not reform itself, and that fascism was its future destiny, was correct for Germany and correct for France.German social democracy could not reform itself to deal with the Great Depression: Rudolf Hilferding, the former finance minister and a leading theorist of the SPD, squashed Wojciech Woytinsky's ambitious proposal to rally the party around a program of large-scale public works and deficit spending—essentially, a German New Deal. Woytinsky, an economist of considerable vision, had argued for state-driven investment to break the cycle of unemployment and deflation, but Hilferding and the party establishment clung to orthodox fiscal rectitude and the gold standard, fearing inflation and the loss of bourgeois confidence more than mass immiseration. The result was paralysis: the SPD, while notionally the party of labor, proved incapable of adapting its ideology to the new economic realities, and so Germany's democratic left found itself outflanked by reactionaries and radicals alike. When the crisis demanded innovation, the party's leadership offered only caution and incrementalism—a failure that, in the end, opened the door to Hitler's seizure of power. Thus the collapse of German social democracy in the face of the Great Depression was not merely a matter of bad luck or external pressure; it was a tragedy of intellectual and organizational rigidity. Hilferding's refusal to break with economic orthodoxy left the SPD unable to offer a plausible alternative to Brüning's austerity, which was driving millions into the arms of the Nazis and Communists. The party's fear of alienating centrist voters, and its lingering trauma from the hyperinflation of 1923, led it to defend a status quo that was already visibly collapsing. In the end, the SPD's commitment to parliamentary procedure and fiscal discipline proved to be a straitjacket—it was, arguably, the last chance to save German democracy from the abyss. In the end, the party's failure was not just tactical or ideological, but existential.Analogously, six years later in France, Leon Blum's Premiership was aslo a failure. He could not keep his Front Populaire coalition together to make his attempt at a New Deal successful in France. When the Popular Front—a grand coalition of Socialists, Radicals, and Communists—came to power in 1936, hopes ran high that France might finally break out of its economic stagnation and political sclerosis with a program of sweeping social reform, much as Roosevelt's New Deal was doing across the Atlantic. Blum's government did indeed enact significant measures: the 40-hour workweek, paid vacations, collective bargaining rights, and wage increases for workers. Yet the coalition was riven by ideological rifts and mutual suspicion: the \"Radicals \"feared Communist revolution more than they desired social progress, the Communists were wary of \"bourgeois\" reformism, and the Socialists were caught in the middle, trying to hold the whole edifice together. When Blum attempted to launch a program of public works and government-led investment to combat the Depression—his own version of the New Deal—he ran headlong into a wall of resistance from the business community, the financial sector, and, crucially, the Bank of France, which refused to countenance deficit spending or currency devaluation. The coalition fractured under the strain, with the Radicals peeling off and the government collapsing in 1937. Thus, the French attempt to construct a New Deal analogue foundered not on lack of vision, but on the shoals of institutional conservatism, elite intransigence, and the inability of the left to maintain a united front.And so the stage was set for the conquest of France by fascism. The failure of Leon Blum's administration led to substantial grumbling, along the lines of \"better Adolf Hitler than Leon Blum\". May and June 1940 saw France's swift and humiliating military defeat by Nazi Germany. That marked a decisive turning point in French political history. Marshal Pétain, the aged hero of Verdun from World War I, was called upon to form a new government as the country reeled from military disaster and the exodus of millions of refugees. Pétain's regime, soon headquartered in the spa town of Vichy, swiftly dismantled the institutions of parliamentary democracy, immediately dissolved the National Assembly, and initiated a program of \"National Revolution\" that abandoned the republican ideals in favor of authoritarianism, Catholic traditionalist integralism, and collaboration with the Nazi occupiers. The original revolutionary \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity\" was erased and replaced by \"Work, Family, Fatherland\".Under Pétain, France became, for the first time in its modern history, a state openly committed to reactionary values and the suppression of political dissent—a regime that interned Jews, persecuted Communists, and sought to \"cleanse\" French society of the supposed degeneracies of the interwar years. The Vichy government's capitulation to fascist ideology was not merely the product of foreign occupation, but the culmination of years of political polarization, elite disillusionment with democracy, and the failure of the French center and left to mount an effective defense of the Republic. It was both the consequence of German military might, but the endpoint of a long process of democratic decay and elite retreat from republican principles. Only Charles de Gaulle and a handful of others urged resistance in June 1940. The overwhelming majority of deputies and senators, traumatized by the scale of defeat and convinced that further resistance was futile, voted to grant Pétain full powers to draw up a new constitution.Many conservative elites, business leaders, and Catholic intellectuals had long yearned for a regime of \"order\" that would restore hierarchy and discipline to a society they saw as enervated by decadence and class conflict. Pétain's ascent was thus greeted by many not as a national tragedy, but as a necessary, even redemptive, correction.And so within a matter of days, the machinery of republican government had been replaced by an authoritarian \"Etat Français,\" with Pétain as \"Chef de l'Etat,\" wielding near-absolute authority. The Vichy regime rapidly set about dismantling the achievements of the Third Republic: labor unions were suppressed, the press was censored, and the principle of secularism was eroded in favor of a Catholic-inflected nationalism. Most infamously, Vichy willingly participated in the persecution of Jews, enacting its own anti-Semitic statutes and facilitating the deportation of tens of thousands to Nazi death camps.Indeed, Dennis's judgment that fascism (or communism) was the future was correct for every place except Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Great Britain, Ireland, and the United States.Share Brad DeLong's Grasping RealityAnd in the United States, at least, I believe it was a nearer-run thing than we recognize today.Suppose Lillian Cross had not hit assassin Giuseppe Zangara with her purse on February 15, 1933. Suppose his bullet had then found the brain of president-elect Franklin Delano Roosevelt rather than the lung of Chicago mayor Anton Čermák. Suppose Roosevelt had died and Čermák lived. Then America's history in the Great Depression years of the 1930s and the world's history since would have been very different. For \"Cactus Jack\" John Nance Garner would then have become president eighteen days later. He was a conservative go-along get-along Democrat from the rural far south of Texas, first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1903. He focused on local issues and party organization rather than championing national progressive reforms, quietly building seniority and influence. He did support measures like the graduated income tax and the Federal Reserve System, but generally aligned with the southern-conservative Bourbon wing of the Democratic Party—those who were not Republican because they remembered that Lincoln had freed the slaves. In the 1920s, Garner rose to Democratic whip and then minority leader, and was known for his skill at legislative maneuvering and coalition-building.Garner became Speaker of the House when the Democrats retook control of the chamber in 1931, and then Vice President in 1933. Initially a key ally in passing New Deal legislation, he later broke with Roosevelt over issues like deficit spending and the expansion of federal power and became a rabid anti-New Dealer.But in our timeline, in this branch of the multiverse, on March 4, 1933, it was Franklin Delano Roosevelt took hold of the US government, broke the gridlock in US politics, and started to experiment with ways to solve the economic problem of the Great Depression. The next day FDR forbade the export of gold and declared a bank holiday. Within four days the House and Senate had convened, and the House unanimously passed Roosevelt's first bill, a banking reform bill, the Emergency Banking Act, that arranged for the reopening of solvent banks, as well as the reorganization of other banks, and gave Roosevelt complete control over gold movements. The second bill Roosevelt submitted to Congress also passed immediately. It was the Economy Act, cutting federal spending and bringing the budget closer to balance. The third was the Beer and Wine Revenue Act, a precursor to an end to Prohibition—the repeal of the constitutional amendment banning the sale of alcohol. On March 29 he called on Congress to regulate financial markets. On March 30 Congress established Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps. On April 19 Roosevelt took the United States off of the gold standard. On May 12 Congress passed Roosevelt's Agricultural Adjustment Act. On May 18 Roosevelt signed the Tennessee Valley Authority Act, creating the first large government-owned utility corporation in the United States. Also on May 18, he submitted to Congress the centerpiece of his first hundred days: the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). All factions within the newly constituted administration won something in the legislation: Businesses won the ability to collude—to draft \"codes of conduct\" that would make it easy to maintain relatively high prices, and to \"plan\" to match capacity to demand. Socialist-leaning planners won the requirement that the government—through the National Recovery Administration (NRA)—approve the industry-drafted plans. Labor won the right to collective bargaining and the right to have minimum wages and maximum hours incorporated into the industry-level plans. Spenders won some $3.3 billion in public works.And so the First New Deal entailed a strong \"corporatist\" program of joint government-industry planning, collusive regulation, and cooperation; strong regulation of commodity prices for the farm sector and other permanent federal benefits; a program of building and operating utilities; huge amounts of other public works spending; meaningful federal regulation of financial markets; insurance for small depositors' bank deposits along with mortgage relief and unemployment relief; a commitment to lower working hours and raise wages (resulting eventually in the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, or Wagner Act); and a promise to lower tariffs (eventually fulfilled in the Reciprocal Tariff Act of 1935).The devaluation of the dollar, plus the NIRA, did break the back of expectations of future deflation. The creation of deposit insurance and the reform of the banking system did make savers willing to trust their money to the banks again and began the re-expansion of the money supply. Corporatism and farm subsidies did spread the pain. Taking budget balance off the agenda helped. Promising unemployment and mortgage relief helped. Promising public works spending helped. All these policy moves kept things from getting worse. They certainly made things somewhat better immediately and substantially better soon thereafter.But aside from devaluation, monetary expansion, an end to expectations of deflation, and an end to pressure for more fiscal contraction, what was the effect of the rest of Roosevelt's \"first one hundred days\"? It is not clear whether the balance sheet of the rest of that period is positive or negative. A full-fledged policy of monetary inflation and mammoth fiscal deficits that might have pulled the country out of the Great Depression quickly—that did pull Hitler's Germany out of the Great Depression quickly—was not really tried. Consumers complained that the National Recovery Administration raised prices. Workers complained that it gave them insufficient voice. Businessmen complained that the government was telling them what to do. Progressives complained that the NRA created monopoly. Spenders worried that collusion among businesses raised prices, reduced production, and increased unemployment. Hoover and his ilk declared that if FDR had only done as Hoover had been doing, everything would have been better sooner.In the face of such criticism Roosevelt kept trying different things. If business-labor-government \"corporatism\" did not work—and was blocked by the mostly Republican-appointed Supreme Court—perhaps a safety net would. The most enduring and powerful accomplishment of the New Deal was to be the Social Security Act of 1935, which provided federal cash assistance for widows, orphans, children without fathers in the home, and the disabled and established a near-universal system of federally funded old-age pensions. If pushing up the dollar price of gold did not work well enough, perhaps strengthening the union movement would: the Wagner Act set down a new set of rules for labor-management conflict and strengthened the union movement, paving the way for a wave of unionization in the United States that survived for half a century. Massive public works and public employment programs restored some self-esteem to workers and transferred money to households without private-sector jobs—but at the probable price of some delay in recovery, as firms and workers saw higher taxes.Other policies were tried: Antitrust policy and the breaking-up of utility monopolies. A more progressive income tax. A hesitant embrace of deficit spending—not just as an unavoidable temporary evil but as a positive good. As the decade came to an end, Roosevelt's concerns necessarily shifted to the forthcoming war in Europe and to the Japanese invasion of China. Dr. New Deal was replaced by Dr. Win the War. In the end the programs of the Second New Deal probably did little to cure the Great Depression in the United States. But they did turn the United States into a modest European-style social democracy.Much followed of consequence. That Franklin Roosevelt was center-left rather than center-right, that the length of the Great Depression meant that institutions were shaped by it in a durable sense, and that the United States was the world's rising superpower, and the only major power not crippled to some degree by World War I—all these factors made a huge difference. After World War II, it had the power and the will to shape the world outside the Iron Curtain. It did so. And that meant the world was to be reshaped in a New Deal rather than a reactionary or fascist mode.Individuals acting in particular ways at precise places at precise moments, not just thinking thoughts but finding themselves with opportunities to make those thoughts influential, matter profoundly. Their deeds in such moments even shape the Grand Narrative of an entire long century.Without FDR, what?Leave a commentBut let me return to Lawrence Dennis, for while he strikes Zack Beauchamp as very wrong, he strikes me as right, but right not in our timeline but rather in many many timelines in the multiverse very close to ours:Read today, Lawrence Dennis's \"Fascism for America\" is equal parts time capsule and fever dream, as it crystallises a temptation that seems today to forever lurk at the edge of democratic capitalism: when the machine misfires, summon the engineer-dictator.Dennis Great Depression not as an episodic downturn but as a structural heart attack induced by liberalism's own operating system. Markets allocate capital? Not when banks cower behind excess reserves. Judicial protections secure property? Not when foreclosure courts would liquidate half the Midwest. Congressional politics balances interests? Not when every lobby raids the Treasury for emergency relief. Add it up and liberalism, Dennis claimed, was simply incapable of the macro-coordination modern economic life required.That diagnosis, ex post, was not entirely crazy. Keynes in Cambridge, Hansen at Harvard, Marriner Eccles at the Fed—all were also groping toward the insight that an under-employment equilibrium could persist unless the state acted forcefully. Where Dennis swerved onto the dark path was in supposing that the only effective action had to be not merely activist but authoritarian. His \"solution\" was textbook corporatism: nationalise credit, marshal savings through compulsory channels, dictate investment priorities, abandon both judicial review and congressional appropriation, and thereby jump-start full employment via ten-billion-dollar construction drives. Dennis did understate the informational and incentive advantages of pluralism. A planning board can set quotas; it cannot, as Hayek would later emphasise, replicate the fine grain of decentralised signals. Dennis's own plan dissolves into vaguery the moment it confronts questions like \"Which factory first? At what real wage? Using which relative price of steel?\" Mussolini's Italy never cracked that code; Stalin's USSR managed brute-force industrialisation only by sacrificing consumption and liberty on a scale Dennis politely ignores.Third—and most important—Dennis pretended that he could erase politics via giving absolute power and energy to a plebiscitary president. Why, he asked, should elites hesitate? Private property would survive—owners would simply be told what to do with it. Workers would gain jobs and \"security,\" a word he repeats with hypnotic insistence. The only losers would be the lawyers and the sentimentalists who worshipped parchment. The masses, Dennis insisted, cared nothing for eighteenth-century verbiage; give them pay-packets and they will salute any flag you wave. Let the president set the goals for society and tell people to fall in line, and people would.Dennis did miss that his plan would merely move politics from legislators to courtiers. Who selects the \"executive council\"? How are errors corrected when neither courts nor elections can bite? His assurance that elites would patriotically align profit with plan is less an argument than an incantation. The twentieth-century record, from Nazi rent-seeking to Soviet nomenklatura privilege, suggests that unchecked hierarchy petrifies quickly into predation.Still, Dennis's 1935 \"Fascism for America\" remains a remarkably candid manifesto for authoritarian reorganisation in the midst of the Great Depression. Dennis begins by noting the convergence of otherwise antagonistic observers—conservatives such as Herbert Hoover, moderate socialists, and Communists—on a single point: liberal capitalism, as embodied in the American constitutional order, is tottering. In his reading, the Depression discredits the liberal state's reliance on private investment, judicial safeguards, and congressional bargaining. Dennis envisions a \"middle-class revolution\" that would supplant checks-and-balances with unified command. The authoritarian state would nationalise credit, enabling unlimited but carefully budgeted public investment in order to absorb the jobless and modernise the nation's capital stock. Simultaneously, it would compel private owners to operate under strict state directives: profits and interest would be permitted only when aligned with the national plan, and any defiance would trigger managerial replacement. Courts would become clerks, enforcing rather than reviewing administrative orders.Dennis goes all-in with the totalitarian conviction that \"order\" and \"welfare\" can be ensured only by concentrating political, economic, and cultural power in the hands of a single hierarchy. Religious institutions, the press, and radio would have to amplify, not challenge, state objectives. A national fascism, led by the current élite but forced to sacrifice laissez-faire prerogatives, can preserve civilisation and even deliver higher living standards through disciplined production. Yet this window is narrow: if the \"ins\" refuse to adapt, the \"outs\" will dismantle the old order violently.Dennis is scornful of liberal paeans to individual liberty. The masses, he argues, have never read Locke or The Federalist; their loyalty is malleable, shaped by propaganda and conditioned by economic security. In the same vein he mocks conservative faith in the Constitution, likening it to Jacobite nostalgia for Bonny Prince Charlie—romantic, futile, and destined for irrelevance once the next crash vaporises banks and savings.Refer a friendAnd it is at this point that I need to remind you of the importance for the successful construction of the social-democratic New Deal Order of not just Roosevelt but Keynes, who had a plan to avoid fascism and communism alike by delivering stable full employment and a not-too-inequitable income distribution via the lightest of light-handed (or light-fingered?) central-planning adjustments to the economic mechanism.The Great Depression was the twentieth century's greatest case of self-inflicted economic catastrophe. As Keynes wrote at its very start, in 1930, the world was \"as capable as before of affording for every one a high standard of life.\" Yet, he said, \"we have involved ourselves in a colossal muddle, having blundered in the control of a delicate machine, the working of which we do not understand.\" Keynes feared in 1930 that \"the slump... [might] pass over into a depression, accompanied by a sagging price level, which might last for years with untold damage to the material wealth and to the social stability of every country alike.\" He then called for resolute, coordinated monetary expansion by the major industrial economies \"to restore confidence in the international long-term bond market... and to restore [raise] prices and profits, so that in due course the wheels of the world's commerce would go round again...\" Nobody followed his direction in 1930, save for Takahashi Korekiyo in Japan, who took the Keynesian path without knowing what it was. He pulled Japan out of the Great Depression very early through bold, proto-Keynesian policies: abandoning the gold standard in 1931, aggressively lowering interest rates, and using the Bank of Japan to finance deficit spending on public works and government programs. Takahashi's policies led to a rapid recovery in Japan—well before the U.S. or Europe—but his later attempts to rein in military spending led to his assassination in 1936.But the dominant reaction to Keynes and his ilk in 1930 was to reject him, as a con artist, for, as Winston Churchill's private secretary, P. J. Grigg, put it, \"an economy could not forever by government financial legerdemain live beyond its means on its wits...\" The claim instead was that mass unemployment was an essential part of the process of economic growth, and that attempts to artificially keep the unproductive from experiencing it would only store up more trouble for the future. We saw this revived during the Great Recession of the 2000s. when thinkers like the University of Chicago's John Cochrane welcomed the prospect of a recession because \"people pounding nails in Nevada need to find something else to do\": he thought recession unemployment would be a welcome spur. Keynes had anticipatorily snarked back long before. Activism and reflation were nevertheless \"the only practicable means of avoiding the destruction of existing economic forms in their entirety.\" Moreover, Keynes snarked further, if his critics were even half-smart, they would have understood that successful capitalism needed the support of an activist government ensuring full employment, for without that, only the lucky innovators would survive, and only the mad would attempt to become innovators. Growth would therefore be much slower than necessary: \"If effective demand is deficient,\" he said, the entrepreneur was \"operating with the odds loaded against him.\" The \"world's wealth\" had \"fallen short of... individual savings; and the difference has been made up by the losses of those whose courage and initiative have not been supplemented by exceptional skill or unusual good fortune.\" Austerity and orthodoxy and laissez-faire were, in the conditions of the world after 1914, deadly destructive mistakes. And the persistence of the Great Depression, no matter how big the budget cuts, showed that Keynes was right. He wrote in 1936, with more than a hint of sarcasm, that his proposals for the \"enlargement of the functions of government\" that were required in order to adjust \"the propensity to consume and the inducement to invest\" might seem \"a terrific encroachment\" on freedom \"to a nineteenth-century publicist or . . . contemporary American financier.\" But, in fact, they were \"the condition of the successful functioning of individual initiative.\" His policies and his alone would produce a world in which not just capitalism but individualism, personal liberty, and personal autonomy—which I believe the extremely bisexual Keynes valued immensely—could survive, for the other authoritarian system options obtained full employment only through great regimentation of society.The underlying message of Keynes's is that the government needs to intervene on as large a scale as needed in order to shape the flow of economy-wide spending and keep it stable, and, in doing so successfully, guard the economy against depressions while preserving the benefits of the market system, along with human economic liberty and political and intellectual freedom.The only substantive difference between a Keynes and, say, a Milton Friedman was that Friedman thought that central banks could do all this alone, via monetary policy by keeping interest rates properly \"neutral.\" Keynes thought more would be required: the government would probably need its own spending and taxing incentives to encourage businesses to invest and households to save. But those incentives alone would probably not be enough: \"I conceive,\" he wrote, \"that a somewhat comprehensive socialisation of investment will prove the only means of securing an approximation to full employment, though this need not exclude all manner of compromises and of devices by which public authority will co-operate with private initiative.\"And so Dennis was wrong.

Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Delta's AI-based price-gouging (permalink) Delta airlines has announced a new surveillance pricing plan: they're going to feed an AI the nonconsensually harvested personal data that data-brokers and credit bureaux hold on you to predict the maximum you're willing to pay, and then price their tickets accordingly: https://fortune.com/2025/07/16/delta-moves-toward-eliminating-set-prices-in-favor-of-ai-that-determines-how-much-you-personally-will-pay-for-a-ticket/ Data-brokers hold all kinds of data on you, from the \"legitimate\" information about everywhere your car has driven, to every point in space that the Bluetooth radios on your phone and headphones have passed, to everything you've bought, to every website you've visited and every search you've performed. They also buy data that has been straight up stolen from you by spyware implanted on your phone: https://www.404media.co/a-startup-is-selling-data-hacked-from-peoples-computers-to-debt-collectors/ All of this can be merged into a single file that you have no right to scrutinize, let alone redact. Biden's Consumer Finance Protection Bureau passed a rule banning all this shit, but Trump illegally killed off that rule: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/15/asshole-to-appetite/#ssn-for-sale Capitalism's highest form of creativity is finding ways to rip you off, and the business world's most creative minds have found a million ways to exploit this data, including surveillance pricing. For example, McDonald's has invested in a Kiwi startup called Plexure that offers to help restaurants jack up the price of your usual order on payday, when you can afford to pay more: https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/05/your-price-named/#privacy-first-again And then there's the Big Three \"Uber for nurses\" apps, which use surveillance data to calculate wages for nurses, offering lower hourly rates to nurses who are carrying a lot of credit-card debt, on the grounds that they are too desperate to turn down a lowball offer: https://pluralistic.net/2024/12/18/loose-flapping-ends/#luigi-has-a-point And just as these gigwork apps are deciding what your labor is worth, surveillance pricing systems decide what your money is worth, charging you more than another otherwise identical customer, for an identical product, meaning your dollar is worth less than that other customer's dollar: https://pluralistic.net/2025/06/24/price-discrimination/ Now we have Delta, which promises to do the same thing, but for plane tickets. Obviously, the aviation industry has long practiced a form of \"price discrimination,\" charging radically different sums for the same seat, based on when you buy the ticket, or when you plan to return. But this is different, and to explain why, here's a link to an article by the great Hubert Horan, who may be best known to my readers for his incredible breakdowns of Uber's finances, but whose life's work is as an aviation analyst: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/07/hubert-horan-can-airlines-get-passengers-to-accept-ai-driven-personalized-surveillance-pricing.html Horan draws a distinction between surveillance pricing and \"second degree price discrimination.\" Surveillance pricing targets you, personally, based on your personal information. \"Second degree price discrimination\" charges everyone like you the same price: like, everyone who buys a roundtrip ticket without a Saturday night stay is charged extra on the grounds that they are probably a price-insensitive business traveler whose fare is being paid by a corporation. Surveillance pricing is first-degree price discrimination, with every customer seeing a different price. Horan argues that second-degree discrimination created efficiencies, for example, by offering cheap last-minute seats to people thinking about going away for the weekend, who fill seats that would otherwise go empty. Horan says these efficiencies have tapped out, thanks to the application of straightforward pricing algorithms to tickets. Now, Delta wants to squeeze more profits out of price discrimination, but by employing first-degree discrimination, they're doing so without any benefit to fliers (unlike second-degree discrimination, which made many fliers better off because they were able to score cheaper tickets). This makes Delta's surveillance pricing a \"pure transfer\" – shifting wealth from fliers to shareholders with no benefit to those fliers. Delta is doing this in partnership with an Israeli firm called Fetcherr, whose sales pitch denies that they are using surveillance data to price tickets, despite what Delta has claimed. Horan doesn't know what to make of this, but he speculates that because Fetcherr bills itself as an AI company, Delta thinks it can impress investors by claiming that it will goose prices by combining surveillance (well understood to be a way to benefit corporations at the expense of their customers) and AI, a hype-filled technology that is endlessly impressive to credulous investors. A bigger mystery is how Fetcherr plans to do surveillance pricing without surveillance. Horan points out that the company's founders come from hedge funds, where automated high-speed AI trader-bots fed on tons of public market data are routinely used. He thinks it's possible that \"Fletchrr doesn’t understand airline pricing very well.\" Also, being finance bros, they thought \"airlines were 'outdated' 'undisrupted' and had seen few recent technological advances.\" But, Horan continues, the reason airlines aren't doing a lot with their algorithmic pricing is that they've already done it all, having pioneered the field. Horan's favored explanation for the disconnection between what Fetcherr and Delta claim they're doing is that, on the one hand, they want to obscure the fact that they're doing surveillance pricing (to avoid regulatory scrutiny and consumer backlash), but on the other hand, they want to telegraph (to investors) that this is exactly what they're doing. It's what Uber already does, repricing both the labor of its drivers based on their economic desperation, and the cost of your fare based on what its surveillance dossier suggests you're willing to pay. It's certainly increased Uber's margins – by effecting a pure transfer from riders and drivers to shareholders. But Uber rides are last-minute, small dollar purchases, which decreases the likelihood that a rider will shop around before booking. By contrast, Horan says, most fliers buy well in advance, from online travel sites that show them lots of competing prices. One thing Horan doesn't mention here is that British Airways has just done a top-to-bottom rejig of its frequent flier program to severely penalize anyone who buys tickets from one of these sites, effectively requiring its fliers to buy from BA.com. For example, I booked a $300 Alaska Airlines ticket on Alaska's website, using my BA frequent flier ID. Under the old system, this would have been worth 10 tier points out of the 1500 needed to get Gold status (0.66%). Under the new system, I got 12 points out of the 20,000 needed to get Gold (0.05%) – a 93% reduction in the reward value of this flight. Which is to say that if you don't book on BA's site, you effectively cannot make status. BA has also announced a surveillance pricing deal with an AI company – and this gambit will block its best fliers from getting a better price from an online travel agency. One other key difference between Uber and Delta: Uber has gone to great lengths to hide the fact that it's doing surveillance pricing from both drivers and riders. Delta issued a press-release! There's a certain kind of neoclassical economist who loves surveillance pricing and praises its \"efficiencies.\" These apologists claim that by increasing the amount of \"information\" in the system, we encourage sellers to discount to customers who can't afford as much, making everyone better off: https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/24/gouging-the-all-seeing-eye/#i-spy This is nonsense. Sellers don't want to \"increase the amount of information in the system.\" They want to spy on you. If you doubt it for an instant, just ask the firms that scrape airline websites for up-to-date pricing information: https://simpleflying.com/ryanair-wins-case-booking-screen-scraping-reselling-tickets/ Not only will airlines sue you for trying to find out what their fares are, they'll also sue you for figuring out how to get a better deal on their fares: https://mediarelations.gwu.edu/media-tip-sheet-american-airlines-sues-travel-website-over-popular-travel-hack-skiplagging They're hardly unique in this: price-gouging grocers also threaten people who scrape their prices to spot collusion and price-fixing: https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/17/how-to-think-about-scraping/ Companies that do surveillance pricing are violently allergic to sousveillance pricing. When they spy on you, that's progress. When you monitor their behavior, that's piracy. As an aside, this reminds me of one of the AI industry's most egregious hoaxes-du-jour: the pretense that \"agentic AI\" is just around the corner, and soon we will be able to ask a chatbot to (e.g.) comparison shop across multiple website for the best airfare and book us a ticket: https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/06/17/apple-may-look-late-to-ai-but-its-aiming-for-something-different This absolutely totally does not work. You should not give your credit-card number to a chatbot and ask it to go out and buy you anything, lest you end up paying $30 for a dozen eggs and buying tickets to a baseball stadium in the middle of the ocean: https://futurism.com/openai-new-ai-agent-food-stadium AI agent demos are so dismal that AI companies are no longer claiming that \"agentic AI\" will involve chatbots that nagivate the web as is. Rather, they're claiming that every website will eventually re-tool so that it can be reliably and predictably addressed by an AI agent, with all of its user interface elements well-labeled and/or addressable programatically, via an API. This is a remarkable sleight of hand! First of all, re-engineering every website to embrace a common set of labels and API fields is a gigantic engineering feat – formally called \"the semantic web\" – that has been attempted since 1999 without any meaningful progress: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web In fact, the first viral article I ever published online was \"Metacrap,\" a critique of semantic web efforts. That essay is now 24 years old: https://people.well.com/user/doctorow/metacrap.htm In that essay, I suggest that there are multiple reasons that companies will not voluntarily retool their sites to make it easier to comparison shop. One important reason is that companies don't believe their products are comparable with competing products (or they don't want you to think so). Coach wants you to think that its $40,000 handbags can't be replaced with a well-made $100 bag or even a $0.10 plastic bag. They are not going to voluntarily categorize their handbag in a way that facilitates these comparisons. Then there are companies that do want to be compared to rivals, for disingenuous reasons. That's why we saw such a proliferation of junk fees (stupid surcharges tacked on at checkout time): hotels, airlines and car rental agencies knew that the majority of their customers shopped for their offerings on comparison sites. By offering a low sticker price, a company could win on price comparison, even though it was substantially more expensive after its junk fees were factored in. Finally, there's the fact that companies want to lie to you, and adding \"semantics\" to the web does nothing to prevent such lies, and indeed, makes them easier to tell. Think of all the Amazon sellers who use deceptive product photos to make you think you're getting (e.g.) a useful kitchen spatula, when they're selling a spatula so small that it appears to be engineered for a dollhouse; or companies that sell powerbanks that look like a useful portable battery but can't even recharge an LED flashlight, etc, etc. AI agents can't tell if metadata is correct or not! Every complex ecosystem has parasites; that goes triple for the web. We won't fix agentic AI by asking people to accurately label their offerings, not when they stand to benefit by lying: https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/24/hermit-kingdom/#simpler-times And if we could rejig the web to make it hospitable to agentic AI, we wouldn't need AI to make this happen. Fetching airfares for several routes and comparing them isn't something you need an AI-style inference engine for – it's a straightforward algorithmic problem that can be easily solved. The part that agentic AI purports to solve isn't figuring out which airfare out of a list is cheapest – it's compiling the list itself, from unstructured data retrieved from heterogeneous websites that are doing everything they can to prevent the compilation of such a list. This is a well-known AI gambit. First, announce that agentic AI will be able to automate tasks that only humans can manage today; then insist that everything has to be changed to be amenable to the new technology. This is exactly what the self-driving car grifters (who were on the leading edge of the AI grift) did. First, they announced that AIs would be able to pilot cars in spaces filled with human drivers, walkers and cyclists. Then, when it became clear that this would result in slaughtersome robot-on-human violence, they demanded that humans curtail their behavior to avoid upsetting the robot. They call this \"the pogo-stick problem\": “I think many AV teams could handle a pogo stick user in pedestrian crosswalk,” Ng told me. “Having said that, bouncing on a pogo stick in the middle of a highway would be really dangerous.” “Rather than building AI to solve the pogo stick problem, we should partner with the government to ask people to be lawful and considerate,” he said. “Safety isn’t just about the quality of the AI technology.” https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530232/self-driving-ai-winter-full-autonomy-waymo-tesla-uber Automation is real and can deliver real benefits to people. Sometimes, automation requires that other systems be adjusted to facilitate its functioning. But this is a gambit. It's a scam. AI agents aren't going to replace human labor. The only way we'll replace human labor with software agents is by redesigning all these heterogeneous, competing systems owned by people who benefit from the status quo and have every motivation to obstruct this project. Good luck with that.

Search grew 12% in Q2, beating forecasts. Cloud sales surged 32%. CEO Sundar Pichai said Google is ramping up capex to support all this growth. But it's still a huge gamble...Get 50% off a group subscriptionHuh...What do I make of this?Here is an attempt at a take:Google's decision to incorporate AI-generated summaries directly into its search results represents a profound shift. Google had functioned as a gateway, directing users outward to a vast constellation of third-party sites, via its blue links. Now this is upended, as outward traffic is halved, with implications for publishers, e-commerce platforms, and information providers who have built their business models around the expectation of Google-driven traffic. They are unsustainable on their old patterns should the AI-summary become the destination and not just the gatekeeper.In the pre-AI era, the company's dominance was already formidable; most online journeys began with a query in the search box. But by answering more questions directly—whether through featured snippets, knowledge panels, or now AI summaries—Google transitions from being a mere index to an oracle. This is history rhyming with how the social networks, by keeping users engaged within their platforms, siphoned attention away from the broader web, to our great detriment. AI summaries perform a similar enclosure, but with the added imprimatur of algorithmic authority.And yet Google is now claiming that, so far, even as the total volume of outbound clicks declines, the value of each remaining click rises. Advertisers, desperate for access to the dwindling pool of users who actually leave Google's domain, find themselves bidding up the price. For Google, this would be a masterstroke—extracting greater rents from advertisers while providing users with what appears to be a more efficient search and knowledge acquisition experience.The missing piece: When users encounter an AI-generated summary on Google and subsequently click through to an advertiser's website, what do they then do? Their post-click behavior becomes a crucial determinant of value for advertisers. Are these users are simply verifying the AI summary's accuracy before bouncing? Or does the AI summary act as a primer, sending only the most motivated, high-quality traffic onward—users primed to engage, convert, or purchase? This dynamic has analogues in the past history of digital advertising: consider the shift from indiscriminate banner ads to targeted, intent-driven search ads in the early 2000s, which dramatically increased both the value-per-click and the efficacy of online marketing. Plus the AI summary may change user expectations and behaviors in ways that are difficult to anticipate or measure.Back up: Google's fear is being disrupted by a firm with a MAMLM that stands between individuals and the web as a whole—that serves as an intermediary that crawls the web once, and then does RLHF and RAG to be a better summarization and brainstorming agent than an individual checking on Google search-result blue links can.This MAMLM would not simply index the web and provide links, but would synthesize, summarize, and even brainstorm on demand, offering users answers and insights far richer than what can be gleaned from clicking through a list of blue links. In this world, the user's primary and monetizable relationship is not with the open web, nor even with Google, but with the AI intermediary itself—a shift that would render Google's core business model, and the web's traditional architecture of discovery and monetization, increasingly obsolete.Google's response: if anyone is going to disrupt our business by doing this, it is going to be us. We will spend whatever it takes to pre-empt such disintermediation by directly building and deploying our own AI summarization and answer-generation capabilities directly into our flagship search product. We will thus cannibalize its own legacy business and simultaneously define the next paradigm—one in which the search page itself becomes the user's destination. One thinks of IBM's embrace of the PC, or Apple's willingness to let the iPhone kill the iPod. But the stakes here are higher, and the feedback loops more treacherous. For Google, the logic is as brutal as it is clear: better to risk undermining the golden goose than to have it stolen outright by a new breed of algorithmic upstart.The vague outlines of the developing situation are, so far, confused:Perhaps the new regime promises greater value for users, as the MAMLM-as-summarization-engine does its work: instead of wading through a swamp of SEO-chaff and clickbait, the user is presented with a concise, context-aware answer—sometimes even a synthetic argument or brainstorm—without ever needing to click away from the search results page. For the harried, time-constrained knowledge worker, this is a godsend. Imagine a world in which one confronts not a list of blue links, but a cogent synthesis, drawing on JSTOR, Wikipedia, and the latest Substack polemic, all in one go. Frictionless knowledge, delivered at the speed of thought, with the AI acting as both librarian and tutor.At the same time, Google claims it is seeing \"equal value\" from monetizing AI-summaries as from monetizing search, on its side of the ledger, at least so far. Even as the volume of outbound clicks falls, advertisers are bidding up the price of each click that remains. Is the theory that these are now higher-intent, more motivated users, pre-filtered by the AI? Are they just so starved for traffic that their willingness to pay is great? Trading quantity for quality, or exerting monopoly power? So far, their auction model is holding up—though one wonders how long that equilibrium can last, and what happens if advertisers start to see diminishing returns.But the losers in this brave new world are the websites. Less traffic flows to the underlying sources, as users are increasingly satisfied by the AI's answer and see little need to click through to the original. For the vast ecosystem of publishers, bloggers, and even e-commerce sites that have built their business models on the back of Google-driven traffic, this is an existential threat. The web risks becoming a substrate for AI extraction, rather than a living network of destinations. And then we get a new form of SEO, dedicated to maximizing AI-slop.Plus: While the promise of greater value for users is seductive, but. The MAMLM-as-summarization-engine promises to collapse the search-and-scan process into a single, authoritative-seeming paragraph. This promises, for the user, a productivity revolution: research that once took hours now happens in seconds. But there is a price: obscured nuance, flattened debate, and consensus prioritized over dissent. Moreover, there is the loss of \"productive friction\"—the serendipity and discovery that comes from wandering through primary sources. Roaming through the stacks of Widener Library, the book you wanted was not the one you had the classification code for but the one three to its left—something you could only learn with a stack pass. The value proposition for users is a Faustian bargain, and we have seen such bargains before.There are two roads:First, if \"AI\" intermediaries are not the future—if it turns out that the grand experiment with AI intermediaries—MAMLMs, summarizers, chatbots, whatever you want to call them—amounts to little more than a high-tech cul-de-sac, Google will have burned through eye-watering sums of capital for what, in retrospect, will look like an overreaction to a phantom threat. The company will have spent nine figures on data centers, GPUs, and armies of engineers, all to defend against the possibility that its search business would be leapfrogged by a new digital oracle. Google's expenditures will have functioned as a kind of \"strategic insurance\"—a hedge against a disruption that never materialized. But the sunk costs are not entirely wasted. Google, at the very least, will have acquired technical capabilities, organizational muscle, and a deeper understanding of the AI landscape—assets that can perhaps be redeployed as the technological winds shift. Second, if \"AI\" intermediaries are the future of digital knowledge navigation, Google is not only betting the farm, but buying up the neighboring counties as well. The company is investing in this transition at a scale that outmatches all rivals. The bet is that in a winner-take-most environment, scale and speed are everything. By moving first and moving big, Google positions itself to capture whatever monetization opportunities arise. This is so as long as \"sufficient quantity has a quality all its own\". History is full of examples: Microsoft's dominance in operating systems, Amazon's in logistics, or even Google's own early days in search, when scale begat quality, and quality begat scale, in a virtuous (for the incumbent) cycle.It is interesting to watch: As AI-powered summarizers threaten to interpose themselves between users and the web, Google is racing to become its own self-disruptor. If you can trade volume for value, and open discovery for algorithmic enclosure, it will. If it turns out to be a dead end, it will have built enormous infrastructure-layer data-processing tools that can be turned to other purposes. Will it get a healthy ROI on those? No. But the enthusiasm of AI-addled investors is keeping this commitment from causing any financial blowback.Of course, this strategy risks eroding the web's ecosystem of content creators, fragmenting user journeys, and triggering regulatory backlash. Advertisers pay more for each precious click, while publishers see their traffic decimated. For users, the promise of instant answers is seductive, but the long-term consequences for information quality, diversity, and innovation remain uncertain. But Google has decided that these things are not its problem now, but somebody else's.With lots of further questions. Here are five:Will advertisers eventually balk at escalating costs, or will the law of diminishing returns force a reckoning with the current model?Is there a potential for a counter-movement—perhaps a new \"open web\" alliance—seeking to reassert the value of outbound linking and decentralized discovery?Could publishers respond by designing landing pages specifically for \"AI-primed\" visitors—pages that acknowledge the summary, offer deeper context, or present unique value not captured in the initial answer?Might we see a bifurcation of the web: one layer optimized for human navigation and engagement, another for AI ingestion and synthesis?How can users maintain agency, critical thinking, and serendipitous discovery in a world where the MAMLM's output is tailored, persuasive, and frictionless?How will Google's internal culture—famously risk-averse and bureaucratic in its later years—adapt to the demands of continuous, existential self-cannibalization?References:Barr, Alistair. 2025. \"Tech Memo July 25, 2025.\" Business Insider. https://l.businessinsider.com/s/vb/bS9v95BHeath, Alex. 2025. \"Google gets its swag back: Reports of Google's death at the hands of ChatGPT have been greatly exaggerated.\" The Verge, July 25. https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/713603/google-search-chatgpt-openai-earnings-ai-race-swagHolmes, Rich. 2025. \"Google is destroying its own business - and still winning.\" Department of Product (Substack). https://departmentofproduct.substack.com/p/google-is-destroying-is-own-businessPew Research Center. 2025. \"AI and Search: How AI Summaries Impact User Behavior.\" Pew Research Center. https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/07/25/ai-and-search-how-ai-summaries-impact-user-behavior/Shmulik, Mark. 2025. \"Google is 'jumping aboard the AI crazy train'.\" Bernstein Research Report.

      "content": "In this issue: we reflect on the conclusion of our first protocol fiction serial The Librarians, and we are live for a Guest Talk with Charity Majors in one hour at 10am Pacific Daylight Time. Stay tuned for Ghosts in Machines! contest updates.Last week, we published the sixth and final act of The Librarians, written by . These short stories emerged from the work of six teams that participated at a futures workshop run by Summer of Protocols at Edge Esmeralda 2025 in Healdsburg, California. Knowledge FuturamaA bit of context on the work behind this series. The Knowledge Futurama workshop's theme — 1000-year libraries — was inspired by the work of our friends at The Long Now Foundation, and in particular by their most recent annual journal, Pace Layers. Forty participants kicked off this futures workshop by answering the following questions:What is the knowledge artifact that you want to preserve for 1,000 years?What is the technology stack for the preservation?What is the social milieu for the preservation?The workshop employed an adversarial, blue team vs. red team format. Blue teams were builders — they fortified, maintained, repaired, and upgraded preservation protocols. Red teams were crises — they designed catastrophes and periods of decline to stress test preservation attempts. Each team played both sides three times, starting as a blue team, as knowledge artifacts rotated through the room. Teams first picked their artifacts and preservation protocols, and finished the round by handing their worksheet to the neighboring table. The second prompt followed:Describe the crisis that affects the prior preservation effort. Keep it sociologically realistic and technologically plausible. No zombies or time travel. The crisis should threaten and reshape in unexpected ways, but not destroy. What is the state of the preservation effort at the end of the crisis in [year]? Describe the state as a set of circumstances and conditions.Each round was set in a different epoch. Round 1: 2025→2125, Round 2: 2125→2425, Round 3: 2425→3025. The artifacts were: Wikipedia. Muir Woods National Monument. Internet Archive. Urban Water Cleaning. The ability to dream. Midwifery. These knowledge artifacts then served as the inspiration for Protocolized's first official series. In this issue we share how to use protocol fiction (PF) as a futures methodology, then look to The Librarians to assess the methodology's strengths and weaknesses. We've made the hybrid worldbuilding/wargaming template publicly available here, as part of the Protocol Field Guide. The following six principles are based on our experience facilitating Knowledge Futurama workshop and the nature of the narratives that emerged from it.Principle #1: Define the future with a system of rules, not events.Key Tension: Heroic Myths vs. World EnginesOur inaugural issue proposed Chiang's Law as a guiding mantra for Protocolized: \"Fantasy is about special people. Science fiction is about strange rules.\"It's not easy to abide by that law. The Hero's Journey dominates storytelling. By default, it's an arc that generates individual aspirations or fantastic worlds that we can escape into — not thorough explorations of possible futures.In order to use PF as an effective futures methodology, you must follow Chiang's Law. If your long-term thinking warps into fantasy the exercise and outputs won't be useful. And if you are in the business of futures or long-term scenario planning, you understand that it's too high stakes to use fantasy as a frame.Even the heroes in Homer's Iliad were subject to the whims of a council of gods and burdened by routine and ritual. Today's fictional heroes are unbound in their godliness, perhaps atrophying our sense of respect for contemporary world engines and our ability to comprehend how they'll drive our world forward. Principle #2: Bundle classes of futures based on media. Key Tension: Collective Worldbuilding vs. Divergent CreativityOver time, protocols have gained fresh meanings. Protocols combine elements of rules and procedures, but also increasingly help compose media and techniques. One tricky aspect to any futures work: how do you stoke creativity AND steer attention to the problem at hand? We recommend you use different types of media as creative buckets. Want to explore the possible failure modes of a nuclear waste storage facility? Write PF using safety reports and newspaper clippings. Interested in testing the robustness of a succession plan? Tell a story with board minutes, a CEO's diary, or an email thread with the company lawyer.Protocol media include meeting minutes, timestamped logs, recipes, diaries, secret letters signed with code names, computer error messages, safety briefings, investment pitches... For a well-known example, Dracula was written in epistolary style as a series of letters and newspaper entries. Because we associate communication protocols with unique settings they can be a clever way to quickly set the vibe of a story.Principle #3: Choose non-human continuity characters.Key Tension: Magnetic Leaders vs. Witness ArtifactsTales of Great Men, Great Bureaucrats, and their great-on-great violence dominates our headlines. While there are people in positions of massive power, it is not usually the people who are the compelling elements. It is the roles that they are in that are interesting and the things or rules that lend their power to those roles. One strand of the history of science and technology has shown that when the moment is right, multiple people can make the same discovery. Newton and Leibniz created calculus in parallel. Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace both sparked biology's paradigm shift to evolutionary theory. Elisha Gray and Graham Bell filed paperwork with the US Patent Office on the same day. If we extended this history into the future, the continuity characters would be the scientific method, social milieus, technologies, and research institutions that interact to produce these discoveries — not the individual scientists.There are several ways to maintain a link to the present without overindexing on specific people. For example, you could construct a PF with a plot that extends over more than three human lifespans. Or cast a material device as the continuity character — like a building or an office space that has a wide variety of occupants and renovations over time.Principle #4: Look for the constants of history.Key Tension: Availability vs. TimelessnessWhat will still be here in 100 years? 500? 1,000? You might not find the constants of history on the main page of the Wall Street Journal or HBR. Our day-to-day attention tends towards the novel rather than the routine. Nor will you always find constants in traditional fiction. Epic arcs capture what changes in history — not what stays the same.Look for the constants of history in interstitial lore. That means get away from the headlines and blockbusters. Big events are noisy. Elements derived from mundane paperwork, proverbs, procedural hacks, centuries-old superstitions, patterns of etiquette, and footnotes will provide your PF with a more solid backbone.Principle #5: Do not make or let things go extinct.Key Tension: Problem Solving vs. Problem ManagementAll futures methodologies have a normative element. Because they contain value judgements they make a statement about how the world should be. The no-extinction principle is the primary normative element of protocol futurology. Nothing is ever eradicated for good. If something is headed for extinction, efforts should be made to save it. This serves two purposes. First, it's in accordance with good protocol design. Biology has some notable examples of why we should not make or let things go extinct. Eradication of wolves in Yellowstone caused the ecosystem to begin collapsing as food chains oscillated out of control. The \"Four Pests Campaign\" of the Great Leap Forward in Maoist China decimated the sparrow population, leading to booms of locusts and low crop yields.Second, this principle forces teams to consider futures that are more than \"the present plus [insert thing your team is building]\". The future will be the present plus many new things. Forcing yourself to allow many competing things to exist will make for more compelling, realistic scenarios to explore.Principle #6: Don't assume that starting perspectives will be persistent. Key Tension: Motivating Opinions vs. Agnostic FuturesJust because a think tank imagined a future doesn't mean think tanks will, or should, exist in that future — let alone specific think tanks. The starting perspective of a PF futures scenario might not be a persistent one. This isn't a prompt to figure out the right side of history. Merely that to use PF as a futures methodology you should assume unpredictable changes in perspective. Opinions and value judgements are dangerous to set as constants of your scenario since they're prone to change.It is useful to consider future social milieus but changes in tools, environments, and social technologies (like media, markets, protocols, and technical standards) are more concrete. Perceptions of these things might change, but the underlying mechanics of those features won't. Tip: Reduce your assumption of persistence by casting your own organization into a peripheral role in the scenario, or even as a villain in the story.Subscribe nowAnalyzing The LibrariansHow do these principles appear in The Librarians? What do each of these stories tell us about the strengths and weaknesses of protocol fiction as a futures methodology? What do they say about the actual future?Act I — The Genesis of MemoryThis protocol fiction's \"main character\" is the organizational form that maintains and protects a version of the Internet Archive. Over the 1,000 years in which the story unfolds, religion evolves into a bureaucracy, then into an embodied intelligence.  Strengths: Enemies in this story are diverse and appear in various forms, from software glitches to political movements fueled by suspicion. Redundancy reveals itself as a necessary component of a preservation strategy. The blend of religiosity and technology.Weaknesses: Leaps in AI capabilities are a major assumption. As memory and storage are so readily available today, it doesn't feel like a compelling focal point – even if it's a critical topic historically.Act II — The Curse of WolvesMuir Woods National Monument is a grove of redwoods that naturalists have conserved for over 100 years. In our workshop, this artifact was assaulted by red teams with fungi, governance feuds, and public relations crises.Strengths: Embodies the non-extinction principle. Hints at a debt that has led the Zhang family to continually train and practice as naturalists.Weaknesses: Using PF well requires a continuity character that isn't just one person. The team behind this scenario should have put more focus on the succession mechanisms in Zhang's family.Act III — The Whimsy IndexDreams are a kind of knowledge artifact. One blue team chose to defend the capacity to dream. That scenario produced a story that is cerebral and deeply entertaining.Strengths: Clearly follows Chiang's Law and spots the traffic jams that a system of rules might generate. The characters' preferences affect the flavor of the story, but its plot follows real protocols.Weaknesses: This methodology can easily get out of hand depending on the subject of the protocol fiction. Dreams are more or less invisible things and impossible to observe with current technology. This severed continuity with the present day.Act IV — Phantom in EdenPreservation of craft and knowledge is an important topic. Sometimes, even with new technology, we don't want to lose old techniques and ways of life. Could midwifery last for another 1,000 years?Strengths: Phantom of Eden touches on immemorial practices and folk tales of parenting to make its story real. It also doesn't project today's perspectives on childrearing onto future populations.Weaknesses: PF doesn't make rich arcs for personal development by default. If you want to have that as part of your story, you'll probably need to make an explicit prompt.Act V — Songs of HydropoliaUrban water cleaning and management protocols have been an integral part of modern life for hundreds of years. Today, we mostly take them for granted. This team chose this artifact for exactly that reason, and it made for another great story.Strengths: Highlights the confluence between sacred and mundane protocols. It also explores the tension between low-tech humanism and risk-tolerant engineering.Weaknesses: While PF futures are particularly well-suited to exploring tensions, they aren't always obvious in narrative form. This particular methodology seems to prompt people to imagine groups or artifacts that each embody one side of a tension, then play it out as a social conflict over engineering decisions (or tough trade-offs in social engineering projects).Act VI — The Last ArchiveIn a nice twist on the first story of the series, The Genesis of Memory, part six concludes the series by exploring the iatrogenesis – the negative side effects – of memory.Strengths: Sometimes the arc of protocol fiction tends towards gloom. This is a good thing for scenario planning, where the goal is often to spot potential negatives and chart a course around or through them.Weaknesses: PF futures can err on the fatalist side, which makes it feel like there's nothing we can do. Be mindful of that weakness and reign people in when they feel overwhelmed when they focus too much on things outside of their control.Guest Talk: ObservabilityJoin us in one hour at 10am Pacific Daylight Time for a guest talk with Charity Majors on the topic of observability as a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from its external outputs.",

      "content": "\"No army can withstand the strength of an idea whose time has come.\" — Victor HugoThe Debate ContinuesMy July 23, 2025 Morningstar article, \"If Active Investing Is the Loser's Game, What's the Winner's Game?\" examining active versus passive investing sparked a passionate response from Jeff Joseph, \"Active vs. Passive Investing and Anti-Intellectualism,\" who attempted to poke holes in the case for passive investing. His critique provides an excellent opportunity to examine the mathematical realities and empirical evidence that define modern portfolio management.The Mathematics Matter More Than the MarketingJoseph argues that \"exactly 50% of all investors must outperform any given average\" — but this reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of how markets actually work. The reality is more nuanced and far less favorable to active management.The Gross vs. Net Returns ProblemWhile it's true that for every dollar of outperformance there must be a dollar of underperformance before expenses, investors don't earn gross returns — they earn net returns (after all expenses, not just expense ratios, but all transactions costs, including market impact costs) . Since active managers charge significantly higher fees than passive funds, and they have higher turnover, they collectively deliver lower net returns to investors. This isn't theory; it's arithmetic.The Evidence is OverwhelmingThe 2024 SPIVA scorecard revealed that 94% of active domestic funds underperformed the S&P 1500 over 20 years. On a risk-adjusted basis, the failure rate exceeded 97%. These aren't close calls — they represent systematic underperformance across the industry.The \"Price Discovery\" Red HerringJoseph suggests that passive investing creates price distortions that should benefit active managers. If this were true, we'd expect to see improving active management performance as passive investing has grown. Instead, the opposite has occurred.In 1998, Charles Ellis wrote what has become an investment classic, Winning the Loser's Game. Ellis presented compelling evidence that led him to conclude that active management was a \"loser's game.\" At the time, even before considering taxes, only about 20 percent of actively managed funds were outperforming on a risk-adjusted basis. Just 12 years later, Eugene Fama and Ken French's 2010 paper, \"Luck versus Skill in the Cross-Section of Mutual Fund Returns\" found that only managers in the 98th and 99th percentiles showed statistically significant skill — essentially the same as random chance would predict. Their finding closely matches the findings of the 2016 study \"Mutual Fund Performance through a Five-Factor Lens,\" by Philipp Meyer-Brauns. Meyer-Brauns found an average negative monthly alpha of -0.06 percent (with a t-stat of 2.3). He also found that about 2.4 percent of the funds had alpha t-stats of 2 or greater, which is slightly fewer than what we would expect by chance (2.9 percent). Meyer-Brauns extended his work in his March 2017 paper \"Luck vs. Skill Across Different Fund Categories.\" He examined four separate categories of U.S. equity mutual funds (large cap value, large cap growth, small cap value, and small cap growth) over the period from January 2000 through June 2016. He found that the best performing funds performed no better than would be expected by chance alone in a zero-alpha world. For example, the by-chance distributions indicate that if all funds could cover their costs, slightly more than 2 percent should be expected to have alpha t-stats larger than 2. Looking at the actual distributions across fund categories, he found that in two of the four categories, large cap value and large cap growth, not a single fund had an alpha t-stat above 2. For the two other categories, small cap value (1.8 percent) and small cap growth (1.1 percent), the percentage was lower than would be expected by chance.The Active Share DisappointmentOne of the most compelling narratives in active management is that funds with high \"Active Share\" — those that deviate most from their benchmarks — should outperform. The initial 2009 research by Cremers and Petajisto seemed to support this idea, giving active management advocates renewed hope.The Follow-Up Studies Tell a Different StoryMultiple subsequent studies have systematically dismantled the Active Share thesis:AQR's Analysis: Using the same database as the original study, the authors of \"Deactivating Active Share,\" found that active share had no predictive power for fund returns when properly controlling for benchmarks.BlackRock's Out-of-Sample Test: Using post-2009 data, their study, \"Estimating Time-Varying Factor Exposures,\" showed active share was negatively correlated (-0.75) with fund returns after controlling for other factors.International Evidence: Studies of Canadian (Active Share Doesn't Live Up to the Hype) and South African funds (Defining Activeness: Active Share, Risk Share & Factor Share) confirmed that active share's failure wasn't limited to U.S. markets.Vanguard's Comprehensive Review: Their 15-year analysis (2004-2018) \"The Urban Legends of Active Share.\" found that low-cost, low-active-share funds actually outperformed high active share funds.Even the Original Author's Updated DataMost tellingly, when I contacted Cremers for post-2002 performance data, he provided me with the table below, which shows the results over that timeframe for the active share quintile portfolios (the first quintile is the lowest active share).Quintile 1 2 3 4 5Alpha -1.05 -1.11 -1.43 -0.68 -0.50T-stat (4.4) (4.2) (5.4) (2.0) (1.1)The strategy that seemed promising in the original study period had \"gone with the wind\" as markets became more efficient.The Paradox of SkillPerhaps the most fascinating finding comes from Pastor, Stambaugh, and Taylor's research, \"Scale and Skill in Active Management,\" which discovered that fund manager skill has actually improved over time — from -5 basis points per month in 1979 to +13 basis points per month in 2011. Yet this skill improvement hasn't translated to better performance for investors.Why Skill Doesn't Equal SuccessThe answer lies in competition. As the active management industry has grown larger and more competitive, it takes more skill just to keep pace. This creates what researchers call \"the paradox of skill\" — as overall skill levels rise, luck can become more important in determining outcomes. That makes it harder to distinguish results that were based on skill or were they based on random luck.The Real Winner's GameThe evidence points to a clear conclusion: for most investors, the winner's game is not trying to pick the few active managers who might outperform, but rather accepting market returns through low-cost, diversified systematic funds.The Math is Simple97% of active funds underperformed on a risk-adjusted basis over 20 years.High active share doesn't predict outperformance.Even improving manager skill hasn't overcome competitive pressures.Total expenses (including bid/offer spreads and market impact costs), not just management fees, matter more than most investors realize.Following the MoneyIt's worth noting that even as this evidence has mounted, we continue to hear annual predictions that \"this year will be different\" or that \"it's a stock picker's market.\" As Upton Sinclair observed, \"It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.\"The flow of investor dollars tells the real story: passive funds absorbed $244 billion while active funds saw outflows of $257 billion in recent periods. Investors are voting with their wallets, choosing the mathematical certainty of capturing market returns over the lottery ticket of trying to beat them.Conclusion: Embracing the Winner's GameThe winner's game isn't about finding the few needles in the haystack of active management. It's about accepting that markets are remarkably efficient (though not perfectly so) at incorporating information into prices, and that your best strategy is to own a piece of that efficiency rather than trying to outsmart it.In a world where 97% of active managers fail to beat their benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis over meaningful time periods, the prudent choice becomes clear. The winner's game is the one where you don't have to win at all — you simply participate in the wealth creation of global capitalism through low-cost, diversified index funds. AQR's founder Cliff Asness put it this way: \"I am fond of saying that active management is an inherently arrogant act. Because the average can't beat the average by investing actively (not market cap indexed) rather you have to assume you are decently better than average. It's an arrogance, to nobody's shock who knows me.\"The strength of this idea may indeed be unstoppable, just as Victor Hugo predicted.Larry Swedroe is the author or co-author of 18 books on investing, including his latest Enrich Your Future.

      "content": "1 Introduction Bayes theorem is the mathematical theorem used to revise probabilities in light of new evidence. For example, suppose that you think that some hypothesis has a 50% probability. Then you learn some fact that is twice as likely if the hypothesis is true as if it's false. Now you should think that the theory has 2/3 probability. The simplest version of Bayes theorem uses odds ratios. Odds ratios tell you the ratio of the likelihood of one theory being true to the likelihood of it being false. For instance, a 2:1 odds ratio tells you that a theory is twice as likely to be true as false; a 3:2 odds ratio tells you that a theory has a 60% likelihood. If you learn new evidence, to figure out the probability of the theory after accounting for the evidence, you simply multiply the odds ratios of the new evidence. If a theory starts out with 60% probability (3:2 odds ratio) and then you learn something twice as likely if it's true than false (2:1 odds ratio), then you multiply 3:2 by 2:1, to get 6:2 or 3:1. Bayes theorem is the mathematically-proven way of changing probabilities in light of new evidence. It can also be used to decide upon beliefs. For instance, if you currently think something has a 50% chance of being true, and then learn some fact that's three times likelier if it's true than if it is false, you should then think there's a 75% chance it's true. I thought I'd apply the methodology to the existence of God.Now, this is hard. The numbers are a bit made up at times. But reasoning with made up numbers is often better than reasoning with no numbers at all. Human intuition isn't good at figuring out probability, so it can often be improved by Bayesian analysis. Even though it often won't be clear whether the odds ratio is 5:1 or 10:1, you can usually have a rough order of magnitude estimate. So while you shouldn't take the results of a Bayesian analysis too literally, and you should feel free to slot in your own numbers, using Bayes' theorem can be a helpful exercise for evaluating hypotheses when there's lots of evidence on both sides. For this reason, I thought I'd do this with theism. I find that when I do this exercise, almost no matter what numbers I use, theism seems to win out by quite a bit. Even if one uses pretty conservative numbers, theism ends up more probable. So...without further ado...here is a Bayesian analysis of God's existence. Much of the theistic evidence I'll talk about has already been listed here. Also, it's hard to compare theism to various other exotic hypotheses like axiarchism and natural teleology, so just for simplicity I'll mostly be comparing theism to default atheism which doesn't include these exotic hypotheses that are kind of like theism. I also use the term God to refer to an all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good being. Lastly, given the sheer number of considerations, I won't be able to assess them much in detail. I'll mostly just link to other places I've discussed them, for this reason. If you want a fuller explanation of the arguments I give here, see this essay. 2 Prior The prior probability of a hypothesis is how likely the hypothesis is before considering any facts about the world. So in deciding upon the prior you should ask: if you were in a dark room with no access to the world, and hadn't considered your own existence (perhaps you were tripping on a powerful drug that eliminates your sense of self), how likely would you think it is that an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God exists. I think a pretty conservative odds ratio is 1:1,000, meaning theism starts with a prior of 1/1,001. Why this number? Well first of all, on some theories, theism is the very simplest way that the world could be. God might be the very simplest entity: a mind or agent totally without limit. Very simple theories tend to take up a very large portion of probability space; the theory that the universe has uniform laws that hold evenly throughout the entire cosmos beats all the theories of how the laws might not be uniform (even though there are infinite ways the laws could not be uniform). There are also various accounts on which God grounds abstract objects like mathematical facts. I don't find these super plausible, but I don't think that they can be ruled out with certainty. Thus, just as one's prior in nominalism and Platonism should be non-trivial, one's prior in theism should be non-trivial if it's considered as a new way to ground abstract objects. Lastly, there are various ontological arguments that purport to explain why God's existence is necessary as a matter of logic. I don't think any of these work, but I'm not highly certain of this fact. Conditional on them working, God must exist, and this is knowable a priori. So one's prior in God existing should be non-zero. All these make a 1/1,001 prior in God existing look pretty reasonable. Maybe something like one in ten thousand is more reasonable or 1%, but I don't think one in a billion is reasonable. You shouldn't be nearly certain in each of the following: God doesn't ground abstract objects. God isn't very simple. All ontological arguments fail. So for this reason, I'm sticking with 1:1,000. 3 Physical universe + laws + nomological harmony How likely is it that there would be a physical universe given theism vs atheism? I think a physical universe is likelier given theism than atheism for a few reasons: A physical world is contingent—it could have been otherwise! Contingent stuff existing at all is somewhat puzzling on atheism. Absent a necessary being explaining the existence of contingency, contingent stuff existing at all is surprising. It would be much simpler for nothing to exist at all. On atheism, it's not super expected that there would be a physical universe. Now admittedly it's not guaranteed on theism either—God could have made a world of merely mental entities or created nothing other than himself. But the odds seem a bit lower on atheism. I conservatively give this a 2:1 odds ratio in favor of theism, but I think anywhere between 1:10 and 10:1 wouldn't be crazy. One common objection is that the probability of a physical universe is 1: if there was no physical universe, we wouldn't be here. But this is confused. The probabilities in question are conditional—how likely a physical universe is given theism vs. given atheism. Of course we know there is a physical universe, but we're trying to see how likely that is given theism vs given atheism. As an analogy, if you see someone get ten royal flushes in a row in poker, you now know that they got ten royal flushes. But still, it's evidence that they're cheating, because on the mere hypothesis they didn't cheat, the odds they'd get ten royal flushes in a row are low. Now, as for the notion that if we hadn't existed we wouldn't have been around to calculate probabilities, that's true but irrelevant. Your existence gives you evidence that your parents didn't use extremely effective contraception. This is true even though if they had, probably you wouldn't have existed. (For more detail, see the section in this essay labeled \"Anthropic principle.\") Whether some evidence is necessary for your existence is totally irrelevant to its conditional probability. A next bit of evidence: the physical stuff that exists in the universe does stuff. Once again, this seems pretty surprising. It would be a lot simpler for all particles to sit dormant and effete, never doing anything. The fact that laws exist at all seems a lot likelier given theism than atheism. Taking into account the existence of a physical universe, the odds of such a thing are very near one. After all, God has no reason to create particles that don't do anything—the reason to make particles is to create agents and perhaps other things of value. So if God is going to make a physical universe, it's almost guaranteed that he'd go through whichever steps are needed to produce agents. In contrasts, on naturalism the odds are a lot lower, because laws are brute and unexplained. I give this an 8:1 update in favor of theism. This seems pretty conservative, but maybe if you're really conservative you could go a bit lower and nearer to 2:1. A third consideration is nomological harmony. Laws apply to the things that exist. This is surprising on each of the views of what laws are: The first view of laws is called a governing view. This says that laws exist over and above the physical things and make them behave in certain ways. Laws function almost as forces that make things behave in some way—the law of gravity makes things with masses attract. But on this view, it's surprising that the laws apply to the things that exist. There could be laws governing mass but nothing with mass—or laws that say \"all Xs do A,\" but no Xs to do A. As an analogy, finding that the laws are applicable is a bit like finding a random collection of game pieces, a rulebook next to them, and noticing that the rulebook lines up with the game pieces. Clear evidence of design! The second view of laws is called the powers view. This says that laws simply describe the powers things have—the things they can do. The law of gravity just means everything has the power to pull on everything else proportional to its quantity of mass. But the powers things have are only operant under certain conditions—for instance, things might have the power to attract Xs, but if there are no Xs, they'll simply lie dormant. Thus, it's very surprising that the powers things have line up with the initial conditions that exist. The third view of powers is called Humeanism. This holds that laws are just abbreviated descriptions of what things do. To say there is a law of gravity is simply to say that objects with mass tend to attract. However, things only behave in various ways under certain conditions, so on this view, it's surprising that the conditions are right for the things in the universe to behave as they do. Now, I'm pretty sure this works on powers views or governing views. On Humeanism, it's not as clear: philosophy wunderkind Joe Schmid has tried to talk me out of this, but I confess I find it hard to make sense of why it doesn't work. I'm also pretty sure Humeanism is wrong, largely because it implies that if there are two different laws that both equally describe reality and have equal simplicity, there's no fact of the matter about which is right. So if law A says \"particle accelerators make atoms zig right,\" and law B says \"particle accelerators make atoms zig right,\" then so long as no one builds a particle accelerator, there really will be no fact of the matter about what would have happened if someone had built a particle accelerator. Nuts! Humeanism also has other problems. For this reason, I give the argument a conservative Bayes factor of 10:1. I think Humeanism is probably wrong and the argument still works if Humeanism is right, but I'm not super certain in either of those, so hard to go vastly above 10:1. 4 Laws and constants Even once laws exist, most of them would produce nothing of value. The simplest laws don't produce any value—it would be vastly simpler for laws to simply result in every particle spinning in a circle or moving in a line. Our laws are in an unlikely goldilocks zone between simplicity and complexity; they give rise to complex structures without devolving to random chaos. This is very surprising especially when you realize that for such a thing to happen, they need to exhibit the following features: Even if things are broadly in the business of interacting with each other, there are certain conditions that have to apply. But most ways reality could be, they wouldn't apply. Things only interact under certain conditions, but that means there are an infinite number of conditions under which they don't apply. For example, you could have all the physical stuff really far apart so that it doesn't interact. And that doesn't seem much less intrinsically probable—it doesn't compromise simplicity. Similarly, you could have there be other stuff that interferes with the interactions—potentially an infinite number of things could do that.Even if the stuff that exists is broadly in the business of interacting, it has to be in the same spacetime region. That's not guaranteed—you could have things occur in their own isolated spacetimes—distinct from each other the way David Lewis's worlds are distinct. Them being in the same world is no simpler and so it's pretty unlikely.For stuff to interact in any way which brings about anything interesting there has to be time. Otherwise, everything would be static. Furthermore, things have to have interactions that play out across time.The stuff has to be all of a similar kind to interact. You might have, for instance, disembodied minds, weird mathematical laws that do stuff, and then also have physical composites. One of the worries of the many worlds interpretation is that something as abstruse and mathematical as a wave function can't explain the real physical stuff of our experience—you could have a world like that where there are abstruse mathematical laws but they don't build up to anything concrete.The stuff all has to be capable of interacting with other things. But surely it's simpler for it to just follow its own plan—for instance, particles that move around in a circle whatever the other particles do.Then, even when the stuff interacts, it has to be able to bind together in stable ways. If particles just bounced off each other but didn't form more complicated composites, nothing interesting would happen.For the stuff to interact, there also has to be space. Now, space might be necessary, but if not, it's another thing needed for reality to hang together.And this is just scratching the surface of the surprisingness. I think this is good for a Bayes factor of over 1,000, but I'll be conservative and give it a Bayes factor of 100. Then, on top of this, the constants of the universe are finely-tuned. Many fall in an infinitesimal range needed to give rise to any complex structures. If the cosmological constant didn't fall in a tiny range, roughly 1/10^120 of the values it could have taken on, either the universe would have immediately collapsed or fallen apart. Conservatively I give this another Bayes factor of 100:1 in favor of theism. 5 Consciousness One of the most surprising facts about our world is: experience exists. When you clump together matter in various ways, it produces consciousness. This isn't surprising given theism—consciousness is the source of most value, so conditional on a perfect God bothering to make a finely-tuned universe, it would probably produce conscious minds But it is surprising on naturalism. A naturalist would not guess that random arrangements of matter would give rise to mind. Even if physicalism is true, and physical stuff giving rise to consciousness is necessary, it's still surprising. Merely stipulating that a thing which you wouldn't expect in advance is necessary doesn't blunt the improbability. If someone gets ten royal flushes in a row, it wouldn't do for them to say \"I'm a determinist, so I think my lucky streak was necessary.\" It's surprising that is necessary rather than something else. Bayesian reasoning is about epistemic probability—how unlikely you'd find something to be—rather than objective probability. If dualism is true, things are even more surprising. Why would there be laws that give rise to minds, of a character utterly unlike all the things in the universe? Why would there be random extra laws, that apply at the level of brains, that make them produce experience? Then, even if there are laws of the form \"such and such physical arrangements give rise to consciousness,\" it's surprising that such and such physical arrangements ever arise. It could be that brains produce consciousness but there simply aren't any brains that ever get created! I conservatively give this a Bayes factor of 200:1. I think the fact that some arrangements of matter give rise to consciousness is good for a Bayes factor of at least 100 (a theist would be at least a hundred times less surprised by that development than a naturalist). The fact those arrangements of matter exist is good for a Bayes factor of at least 2. 6 Psychophysical harmony The argument from psychophysical harmony is one of the best arguments for God's existence. It begins by noting that there's a harmonious pairing between the mental and the physical. Often, people have experiences that feel bad. When this happens, they behave to avoid those experiences. When you put your hand in hot water and feel pain, you pull your hand away. Similarly, we often talk about our mental states, and our talk is accurate. For example, when people say \"I'm sad,\" or \"I see a brown desk,\" most of the time what they say is true. What happens physically lines up with what's going on mentally. The way we talk and behave matches up harmoniously with what we're experiencing. When you have a desire for your limbs to move in a particular way, they move in that way. This doesn't sound that surprising, but it is when one takes the time to really think about it. First, however, we'll have to get clear on the notion of psychophysical laws. The psychophysical laws simply govern the relationship between the mental and the physical. They determine which mental states cause which physical states and which physical states cause which mental states. Specifically, our psychophysical laws result in a few kinds of harmony: Normative harmony: when we have experiences that make it fitting for us to behave in certain ways, we often behave in those ways. For example, pain makes it worth pulling your hand away, and when you're in pain, you pull your hand away. Semantic harmony: our talk about consciousness lines up with what's going on consciously. For instance, when people say \"I have a blue square in my visual field,\" they usually do. Behavioral harmony: our behavior lines up with our conscious desires. For instance, when you want to move your limbs, your limbs move. When you want to write a poem, tilt your head, or do anything else, your body cooperates. None of this sounds strange. It's all so natural as to be banal. But when you seriously reflect on what's involved it starts to look really weird. Most ways the mental and the physical could have paired would have produced nothing of the sort. For instance, you could have had the following pairings: We could behaviorally disposed to do the opposite of what we want. So, for instance, you'd bang your finger, feel pleasure, think \"I want more of that,\" and then that would cause you to pull your hand away. Note: it's not that you'd want to pull your hand away, but instead that you'd be behaviorally disposed to do the exact opposite of what you want. Every creature with a brain processing information could simply have the experience of seeing a red wall. This would be a very simple law—far simpler than our rich and integrated set of mental-physical pairings—and yet wouldn't produce harmony, or anything of significant value. In such a world, creatures would evolve to have all sorts of complex behavioral dispositions, but would have a rudimentary mental life. There could be some other set of causal links between the mental and the physical. Thus, perhaps the experience that would precede you moving your right arm would be having an image of a yellow star. Evolution would select for your brain being disposed to see a yellow star when it would be beneficial to move your arm. If any of these were the laws, very different sorts of creatures would evolve. They would, in many cases, be behaviorally like us, but would have radical disharmony. Thus, the fact that there's harmony is good evidence for theism. I've only briefly begun to scratch the surface. There are plenty of helpful resources for getting the argument. There's a law of nature that everyone who finds the argument persuasive gets so irritated by people misunderstanding it that they write a brief explainer on it. My friend Amos has a several-part series on it; my other friend Apologetics Squared (not the name his parents gave him) has an incredible series on YouTube of 38 very short videos, roughly 1 minute in length, explaining and defending the argument, as well as a pretty short and comprehensive video on it; Dustin Crummett and Brian Cutter have a paper on the argument (I'm starting to think I'm friends with everyone in the world who likes the argument); and I have an article on it. I conservatively give the argument a Bayes factor of 20:1 (it would be higher but we already have a lot in the background and these things aren't independent). 7 Miscellaneous You exist! Out of the uncountably infinite possible people who could exist, you happen to. On atheism, this is very surprising—even if someone exists, it's very unlikely it would be you. On theism, however, God is likely to make a giant infinity worth of people, which makes your existence vastly likelier. Your existence is likelier if more people exist; God's existence predicts the existence of vastly more people than atheism, so your existence is very strong evidence for God's existence. This is called the anthropic argument. It's a hard one to get your head around, but I think when you get it, it's one of the most persuasive theistic arguments. Here's a brief article where I've explained it in more detail and here's a comprehensive post addressing every objection. I think it's good for a Bayes factor of at least 100, because SIA (the idea that your existence is likelier if there are more people) is almost certainly true, and a reworked version of the argument works on every view of anthropics. This might be controversial—smaller minds can't fathom the ways of anthropics or the high Bayes factors therein, but I felt constitutionally incapable of giving the argument a Bayes factor below 100. Then, there is the fact that we are capable of grasping morality, modality, and various truths about metaphysics. If our brains were purely the result of unguided natural selection, it would be a vast coincidence if we knew anything about morality—if our beliefs bore any relationship to what was morally right. But we do know things about morality; we know, for instance, that it's wrong to torture babies. This is evidence for theism. And as I explain in the article, even if you don't believe in objective morality, similar puzzles arise in other domains, like our knowledge of induction, so the argument still has force. I think this is good for a Bayes factor of 20:1. Even putting aside my in principle arguments for why naturalism wouldn't produce moral and inductive knowledge, it's pretty surprising on naturalism that we're the sorts of creatures that can discover the universe! A priori you wouldn't expect monkeys in suits to be able to discover the laws of physics. Another argument good for a sizeable Bayes factor: we're not in a skeptical scenario. There are many different ways we could be in a skeptical scenario given naturalism. These include: One of the many infinite scenarios where probabilities break. Us being Boltzmann brains. Modal realism. Us being brains in vats.And more. The odds that none would obtain are low on naturalism but high on theism. So I'll give this a Bayes factor of 5:1. 8 Evil Here's a big fact that favors atheism: the world is filled with blind, indifferent natural laws that churn out vast quantities of evil. Animals have been suffering and dying for millions of years. The laws operate with no regard for value. Now, there are some theodicies that can explain this, but it's still pretty surprising: let's be generous and give it a Bayes factor of 10,000:1 in favor of atheism.I think this is pretty generous. The disjunct of all theodicies that explain a broadly indifferent universe is non-trivial. Even if you think evil totally disqualifies theism, you shouldn't be certain of that judgment, so you shouldn't give it a Bayes factor much higher than this. Then, there's divine hiddenness. I don't actually think this is good for a very high Bayes factor. Once we have evil in the background, then we've already admitted the presence of a world filled with hideous depravity: rape, cancer, torture, murder, disease, and predation. If there is an explanation of all that, it's not that unlikely that a similar explanation would provide for our blindness to God's existence. And while it is somewhat unlikely given theism that God would be unknown to so many, it's also unlikely given atheism that God would be known to so many. Let's be generous and give hiddenness a Bayes factor of 10:1, even conditioning on evil. Taking into account the scale of the universe—the fact that it's mostly inhospitable and empty—maybe at the high end, we'll get another Bayes factor of 5. I don't think this is hugely evidentially significant because it's mostly just pointing to bad things about the universe (the fact it's barren and we can't live in most of it) but that's mostly covered by the problem of evil. Maybe we'll get another Bayes factor of 2 from religious confusion, but again, this is mostly covered by evil and hiddenness. There are various other considerations—the biological role of pleasure and pain, for instance, as well as the suffering of moral patients—but these are already covered under evil, and more broadly, they're covered by an explanation of a pitiless and indifferent world. I'm somewhat left scratching my head at what the other atheist evidence is supposed to be. It's mostly just stuff about the world that's bad. But once you take into account blind and indifferent laws, you can explain those things. Maybe you can get another Bayes factor of 4 or something from the absence of miracles. But probably this is already covered under indifferent laws, and there are some well-documented miracles. So I'll generously give this a Bayes factor of 4 in favor of atheism, but I don't really buy it. 9 Time to calculate I didn't include some other arguments: The Kalam because it has negligible weight. The moral argument for the same reason. Arguments for theistic incoherence because those went into the priors. Arguments from biological design because they have no force. Any of Feser's arguments because they suck. Arguments from widespread religious experience which I actually think have decent force, because I was being generous and think most people don't find this convincing (still, a world where people go around constantly having powerful religious experiences is surely at least somewhat likelier given theism than atheism). Arguments from souls and libertarian free will, because even though I find them moving, most of you don't believe in such things. The argument from haecceities because it's weird enough that even though it might work, it's not good for any serious Bayes factor. The argument from widespread theistic belief because I counted that as a mitigating factor under divine hiddenness. But taking into account what I did include we get a Bayes factor of 64000000000000:2000000000. Or, to simplify, 32,000:1 in favor of theism. If you take these numbers completely literally, your credence in atheism would be one in 32,001. Now, obviously you shouldn't take these numbers too literally. It's important to distinguish between confidence levels inside and outside of an argument. If an argument tells you with 99.99% certainty that some view is right, it's likelier the argument is wrong than .001% odds. The odds I've gone wrong somewhere are a lot more than one in 32,000, which are the odds this tells us to assign to theism. And if you don't buy some of the big theistic arguments, this could pretty easily flip (though you should also not buy the high Bayes factors I've given to atheist arguments then either). But I did think my numbers were pretty conservative. I gave decent weight to atheistic arguments I thought had negative weight and assumed that the problem of evil was vastly more significant than any of the arguments for theism. Even then, theism won by quite a lot. I think the core probabilistic argument for atheism is this: atheism really only has one very significant piece of evidence. That evidence is the suckiness and indifference of the world. Theism, in contrast, has many converging lines of evidence. So it's pretty hard for the atheistic evidence to outweigh the many different converging lines of theistic evidence. Just like a single argument wouldn't be enough to overturn the many converging lines of evidence favoring evolution, a single argument isn't enough to overturn the many convergent lines of evidence favoring theism. Now, maybe I should have given the arguments a lower Bayes factor. Perhaps I should think it's likely enough that I'm wrong about psychophysical harmony and anthropics that it's not good for the kind of Bayes factor I gave it. But then we'd also have to lower the problem of evil Bayes factor—lots of smart atheistic philosophers don't think evil has any force. If we did that, and also made our priors less extreme, theism would win by even more. So even though you shouldn't take these numbers too literally or have them as your exact credence (my credence in theism is no more than 70%, for instance) it is suggestive that even when assigning conservative probability estimates, Bayesian analysis ends up favoring theism by a lot! This isn't the only thing that should affect whether you believe in God, but it should at least be one of the factors you consider! If you disagree with my results, plug in your own numbers! I think you might be shocked by what you find. An atheist friend of mine assigned pretty atheist friendly numbers (I think his prior in theism was one in a billion, for instance) and his credence in theism output by the model was about one in seven. Avoiding theism is surprisingly hard when you do the math! Atheists often say that they would believe in God if they received a divine revelation. Well they have something almost as good: a Bayesian analysis! Surely this should be enough to convince everyone to love the lord with all their heart, soul, and might! If you would believe the good lord, resplendent in power and glory, if he announced his existence, then you should believe his good reverend—Thomas Bayes—when he tells you that God exists!",

Hollis says \"Spite may be the most undertheorized force in creative achievement.\" Is that because spite is so hard to define? Even Johnson could only manage a string of epithets: \"Malice; rancour; hate; malignity; malevolence.\"Spite is a species of hate, somewhere between revenge and contempt, in which our scorn for an enemy, pest, nemesis, or rival is made into a productive capacity, overwhelming us by becoming the motivating energy of action. Spite ruins mediocrities, but sets genius alight with a brilliant fire that sustains itself by consuming itself, attracting more and more fuel as it becomes notorious to others and preoccupying to the hater. Spite is the release of unreasonable feeling; it is a partisan, chauvinist, personal expression; spite pretends to principle; alas, it has none. Politics is the great art of spite, followed by poetry, the allocation of capital, and family feuds. None of these is primarily, or purely, an art of spite, but each has the greatest potential to achieve something significant for the sake of malice towards another person. Some spites are general, as in the rage of party politics, the bigotry of policy, but all have some personal correspondence. We never hate entirely in the abstract. Spite is a kind of desire, the lust of despising, the thirst of dismissal. There is a canon of obviously spiteful literature, such as the Dunciad and The Bickerstaff Papers, but a great deal of the traditional canon is full of spite, too: parts of Dante, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Goethe, Gogol, Hans Christian Andersen, Zola, Hazlitt, Bronte, and Grimm; and so much of Shakespeare: what is Hamlet but a study of spite? (\"The time is out of joint: O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right!\"); then there is Iago, Edmund, Romeo killing Tybalt, Beatrice (\"kill Claudio!\"), Bertram, Portia—, indeed, the great achievement of The Merchant of Venice is to show that the spite which underlies traditional comedy like The Comedy of Errors can be brought to the surface, viciously, unrelenting, and the play can still end with the final act where all are married (Antonio aside). We have a great tolerance of spite, even when it exposes itself and all our hypocrisy. Paradise Lost is the great epic of spite, providing this whole area of study with its epigram: \"Done all to spite/The great Creator.\" A motto for our envious, entitled, rash, and bloody times! Milton's poem is often about spite, and provides another good definition: \"the hateful siege/Of contraries: all good to me becomes/Bane.\"1Spite is the great exposer of the biographical nature of life. So much that we do, we do for personal spite. So much of history and literary study and politics is the study of personality. Gulliver's Travels understands this, constantly pointing to the role of petty temperaments in the discussion of grand ideals. In her 'Notes on Spite', admits that spite is biographical. The biographical record systematically obscures spite's role because spite-driven creators rarely advertise their motivations.Despite her obvious talents, Hollis is one of those who dislikes biography. But nothing else can make a proper study of spite: even those political commentators who disagree with the great man theory of history will note, every day, the role of interpersonal rivalry in the making of history. (Even literary theorists must accept that authors are the fount of literature when it is their work under discussion; which of them does not make a worship of Raymond Williams or Frederic Jameson?) I cannot think of a great biography that does not, in some manner more or less subtle, expose the role of spite in the writer's life. Indeed, the great works of spite often make the display of spite so obvious we look right past it, as Hollis says.The acknowledgement of spite as a great force to be theorised is the acknowledgement that man is a biographical animal, that biography is among the greatest critical arts. Perhaps there can be no true theory of spite: it is too personal.1And, slightly further down, But what will not ambition and revengeDescend to? Who aspires, must down as lowAs high he soared; obnoxious, first or last,To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet,Bitter ere long, back on itself recoils:Let it; I reck not, so it light well aimed,Since higher I fall short, on him who nextProvokes my envy, this new favouriteOf Heaven, this man of clay, son of despite,Whom, us the more to spite, his Maker raisedFrom dust: Spite then with spite is best repaid.",

      "content": "Over at Margaret Sullivan's always-excellent newsletter, she's got an exclusive on something called the Media Capitulation Index. Free Press, the media advocacy group (not to be confused with Bari Weiss' thing), basically created a report card for how badly major media companies are caving to Trump administration pressure. Their rating system? Stars for independence, chickens for capitulation.Out of 35 major media and tech companies they evaluated, exactly two earned stars: Bloomberg and Netflix. Two! Everyone else is somewhere on the chicken scale, from \"vulnerable\" (one chicken) all the way to \"propaganda\" (five chickens).The Present Age is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.The New York Times scored one chicken. CBS's parent company Paramount got three. Disney, which owns ABC, also three. Meta clocked in at four chickens, which tracks given Zuckerberg's recent Mar-a-Lago residency application. Fox also got four, and honestly, I'm surprised it wasn't five.The full propaganda rating went to Trump Media and X/SpaceX, because of course it did.This index dropped at a perfect time. We just watched CBS pay $16 million to Trump over a basic 60 Minutes edit. ABC handed over $15 million for something they probably could've beaten in court. Bezos spiked the Post's endorsement and then donated a million to Trump's inauguration. It's like watching everyone pay protection money in real time.Free Press identified four main ways these companies capitulate: through payments, abandoning DEI commitments, editorial interference, and old-fashioned ring-kissing at Mar-a-Lago. They trace the problem back to media consolidation post-1996 Telecommunications Act, when we basically handed the keys to billionaires and acted surprised when they started driving toward their own interests. Get the dataThe actual index Free Press created is worth digging into. It's not just a list of ratings — they built an interactive report where you can click through each company and read exactly how they earned their chicken rating.Take Google's parent company Alphabet, sitting at two chickens. Click through and you'll find they're part of a $9 billion Pentagon contract alongside Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle. Suddenly that million-dollar donation to Trump's inauguration makes more sense. Same with their abrupt decision to scrap diversity programs.Or look at Paramount's three-chicken rating. The report details how they spent the summer desperately seeking approval for their Skydance merger, which meant playing nice with an administration that could block the deal. Every corporate decision starts looking different when you see the regulatory pressures behind it.Each entry also tracks what Free Press calls \"DEI Doublespeak\" — companies that made big commitments to diversity and inclusion a few years ago, only to quietly dismantle those programs the moment it became politically inconvenient. T-Mobile dissolved its civil rights partnerships while seeking merger approval. Pattern recognition doesn't require a PhD here.The report even includes specific examples of editorial interference, like Warner Bros Discovery pressuring CNN to soften Trump coverage. Not speculation, not reading between the lines — documented pressure to change coverage.ShareStill, take it with a grain of saltI'm not saying you should base all your media consumption decisions on whether a company got two chickens or four. This index isn't gospel. It's one organization's attempt to measure something that usually stays invisible—the quiet compromises, the editorial tweaks, the donations that buy access rather than news coverage.But I appreciate that someone's trying to put numbers on what we're all watching happen. When media companies insist they're maintaining editorial independence while simultaneously paying millions in settlements and showing up at Mar-a-Lago with checkbooks, it helps to have receipts. Even if the chicken metaphor is a bit much. The real value might be in forcing us to think about these connections.Free Press put together something that makes the abstract understandable. That's useful, even if you quibble with their methodology or think they were too harsh on your preferred outlet. At minimum, it's a starting point for conversations we should've been having years ago about who owns our media and what they want in return.The full report's worth browsing, if only to see how deep these entanglements go. And those facts paint a picture of a media ecosystem that's way more compromised than most of us want to admit.Leave a commentIn other newsThe death of the anonymous internetThe UK's new Online Safety Act requires age verification for porn and other adult content, and VPN downloads immediately exploded. According to Wired's Lily Hay Newman and Matt Burgess, VPN sign-ups surged by as much as 1,800 percent after the law went into effect Friday. But here's the thing—the law doesn't just cover porn. It also applies to content about self-harm, suicide, and eating disorders, and platforms like Reddit, X, and Bluesky are now adding age verification for tons of previously accessible content. Digital rights advocates are warning this normalizes surveillance mechanisms that governments can easily expand later.The UK's Online Safety Act is now forcing Reddit users to upload selfies or photo IDs to view subreddits documenting war crimes and conflict footage. According to 404 Media's Emanuel Maiberg, communities are being labeled \"mature content\" and locked behind age verification. Reddit is using a company called Persona (backed by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, naturally) to handle the ID checks. As Maiberg points out, this isn't just about protecting kids — it's making crucial information about ongoing atrocities and conflicts harder to access for everyone. The same pattern is spreading to the US with similar age verification laws expanding state by state.A women's safety app called Tea just leaked 72,000 verification selfies and government IDs, and it perfectly illustrates why the UK's new age verification laws are a disaster waiting to happen. Garbage Day's Ryan Broderick writes, Tea required users to upload photos and IDs to prove they were women so they could review men in their area. The app's security was so bad that hackers found all the unencrypted data sitting in a public directory. Now those photos are on 4chan, turned into a \"hot or not\" ranking app, and mapped by location. Meanwhile, the UK just rolled out similar ID verification requirements for accessing \"harmful content\" online — which apparently includes protest footage and subreddits about cider. As one engineer put it: \"The biggest story on US Twitter being an app leaking all of its users ID's while in the UK it's the government rolling out ID verification to access the internet and claiming it's perfectly safe.\"Shooting in NYCA gunman killed four people at a Manhattan office building Monday while trying to reach NFL headquarters, claiming in a note that he had CTE from high school football. The Associated Press reports that Shane Tamura drove cross-country from Las Vegas, entered the wrong elevator bank, and shot several people before killing himself. The note accused the NFL of concealing brain injury dangers for profit — despite Tamura never playing professional football, only high school ball nearly two decades ago.This isn't the first time a former football player has turned to violence while claiming CTE was to blame. The New York Times' Ken Belson notes that Aaron Hernandez, who murdered an acquaintance, was later found to have severe CTE, and in 2021, former NFL cornerback Phillip Adams shot and killed five people in South Carolina before dying by suicide. Several other former players like Dave Duerson and Junior Seau deliberately shot themselves in the chest (rather than the head) so their brains could be studied for the disease. The problem is that CTE can only be definitively diagnosed after death, meaning these claims can't be verified until it's too late. Researchers are trying to develop tests for the living, but results have been hit-or-miss.Our big, dumb worldRepublicans in nearly 20 states are pushing bills to ban \"weather modification\" based on chemtrail conspiracy theories, with Tennessee and Florida already signing them into law. NBC News reports that Marjorie Taylor Greene and Tim Burchett introduced federal legislation hitting alleged weather modifiers with up to $100,000 fines and five years in prison. Greene feels vindicated after years of being mocked for claiming \"they're controlling the weather.\" As one meteorologist put it: \"To outlaw something that doesn't really exist to appease voters is so incredibly easy. It would be like if voters hated unicorns and I passed an anti-unicorn bill.\"The EPA took the unusual step of creating websites to debunk chemtrail conspiracy theories after catastrophic flooding in Texas sparked wild claims about weather modification. The New York Times' Maxine Joselow reported this month that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said his team compiled \"everything we know about contrails and geoengineering\" to release publicly, noting that chemtrails are \"often inaccurately\" conflated with normal condensation trails from airplanes. One atmospheric scientist said the EPA's effort seems reasonable but warned that \"those already convinced of the conspiracy will likely be unmoved. Instead, they'll probably just conclude that the E.P.A. is in on the coverup.\"But before you give the EPA too much credit, Administrator Lee Zeldin also announced Tuesday he's trying to overturn the agency's 2009 scientific finding that greenhouse gases threaten human health. Axios reports that Zeldin called this \"driving a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion\" on a conservative podcast. The endangerment finding provides the legal basis for regulating emissions from cars and power plants under the Clean Air Act, so overturning it would gut most climate regulations. Zeldin argued he wants \"clean air, land and water\" but alleged there are people who want to \"bankrupt the country\" in the name of battling climate change. So apparently the EPA has time to debunk chemtrail conspiracies but is actively working to ignore the actual scientific consensus on climate change. Great.",

      "content": "Hieronymus Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights is one of the most disturbing, yet simultaneously intriguing, paintings ever created.More than just a feast for the eyes, it's a work that bridges the gap between medieval and modern art — and is accordingly just as strange as you'd expect. But more than that, it's a painting that asks provocative questions about the nature of beauty, horror, and hell.Today, we explore one of the most famous works of the past millennium, and its 500-year-old warning...Reminder: you can support our mission and get tons of members-only content for a few dollars per month:Full-length articles every Wednesday and SaturdayMembers-only podcasts and exclusive interviewsThe entire archive of great literature, art, and philosophy breakdownsIn the last year, we've written about everything from Milton's Paradise Lost, to why Tolkien hated Dune, to Dante's tips for reading the Bible (or any epic story)...Subscribe nowA Mystery From a MysteryHieronymus Bosch is a historical enigma. The early Dutch Renaissance master left few details about his life, no personal writings, and no hints about what motivated his darkly fantastical paintings. The Garden of Earthly Delights, unquestionably his most famous work, is even more enigmatic than its artist.As a triptych — a three-panel painting that folds like a book — altarpiece, Bosch designed his Garden to be a vision of the whole world. To make this clear, he began by adorning the outside of the triptych with a globe that shows the third day of creation.Once opened, the piece reads like a book from left to right. On the left panel, Adam and Eve meet for the first time in the Garden of Eden. In the center, innumerable human figures cavort in the Garden of Earthly Delights. And on the right, the story ends with tortured souls enduring agony in Hell.But if this sounds like a straightforwardly moralistic painting, think again. Though the panels look like something from a nightmare-inducing hallucination, each one offers its own perspective and wisdom to the viewer...The Garden of EdenYou might think a painting about humanity's descent into hedonism would begin with Eve taking her fateful bite of the forbidden fruit. But here, Bosch takes a deceptively peaceful direction.The first panel depicts Adam in the Garden of Eden as God presents him with the first woman, Eve. The background scenery seems peaceful as a plethora of animals — especially those associated with fertility — roam about an idyllic landscape. The theme is romantic love, blessed by God.However, there are some disturbing foreshadows of what's to come. A three-headed lizard crawls out of the main pond, hinting at the presence of the Serpent. A pink statue appears to take the form of a sinister face — perhaps a surrealist depiction of Satan.Even Adam's rosy cheeks are a sign of trouble ahead, as blushing was considered a sign of arousal and lust. Man's sinful nature will come to fruition in the next panel, but for now, all seems to be perfect.But that's the point: because even in the midst of what seems like paradise, evil is still lurking for a chance to strike...The Garden of Earthly DelightsThe central panel explodes with nude figures. It's a chaotic realm of animals, people, and plants that all intertwine in bizarre, disturbing ways. Particularly discerning viewers will notice the figure of God is no longer present.Since this panel is also set in a garden, it's easy to mistake it for a continuation of Eden — but Bosch is manipulating your confusion to make a point. Because while the Garden of Eden signifies paradise in the Bible, gardens in medieval art were often used to represent lovers and illicit sexuality. Bosch capitalizes on these two meanings to reveal just how easy it is to mistake earthly pleasures for heavenly joy.A multitude of sexual symbols — from fruit to flowers to animals — abound, with some taking on particularly bizarre manifestations. Some figures are trapped inside water bubbles caressing delicious fruits. One places a bouquet between another's buttocks. Still others chase each other while riding on the backs of various animals. And that just scratches the surface of their imaginative antics.This panel has the feeling of walking into a crowded arcade: with so many enticements vying for your attention, you're easily bewildered and don't know where to look.The imagery is almost all sexual, but it's shorthand for all the types of gratification human beings chase. Bosch's vision leaves you sickened at the obscene indulgence of lust, gluttony, and every other human appetite — yet at the same time, it's hard to look away...HellThe final panel of Bosch's triptych shows the artist's vision of where unbridled self-indulgence leads — to a hell unlike any you've seen before.Instead of devils with pitchforks, everyday items like musical instruments become instruments of torture. Horrifying monsters operate nameless, mechanical torture devices, and some of the damned are crushed under a gigantic pair of ears.It's a scene of terror that defies description, and its horror rests largely on the fact that normal objects have been nightmarishly perverted to become the focal points of hell.Yet this surrealist world of torture is not entirely bereft of logic, as some of the damned suffer torments that fit their earthly sins. For example, a glutton is forced to vomit into a pit, and a vain woman stares at her reflection while devilish hands grab at her.It's precisely because Bosch leaves out the standard symbols of hellish punishment that his realm of the damned is so horrifying — it's as if damnation means that logic itself begins to dissolve into insanity.The final major theme of note in Bosch's Hell is that all the horror is man-made: the organic-looking structures of previous panels are gone, and everything is now decidedly industrial. All the creations of man, even the musical instruments, have turned on him...What Does It All Mean?The strangest thing about this painting, however, is when it was made. It wasn't created in the 20th century, nor during an era of absurdism or nihilism. Rather, it was painted within years of Da Vinci's Last Supper — i.e., during the height of the Renaissance.The Garden of Earthly Delights clearly trespasses the Renaissance's core theme of humanism. Instead of celebrating man's potential, Bosch displays the downward spiral that humanity's undisciplined passions create. But that's not to say that Bosch was a rule-bound moralist.Yes, religious paintings were the accepted genre of his time, but Garden was unlike any moral artwork yet seen. Its sheer weirdness and horror clearly set it apart. The key to understanding the painting, though, is to realize that it's not actually as much a departure from traditional Christian art as it first seems.Scholarly opinion has never fully settled whether Bosch was a fervent Christian believer or an intentional critic of organized religion. But perhaps he was something else entirely — a thinker whom the artistic norms of his day couldn't contain, and who presented the nightmares of his imagination with an ironic relationship to his faith.The Gargoyles that GuardLastly, The Garden of Earthly Delights takes its inspiration in large part from medieval gargoyles. These grotesque figures traditionally perched on the outer walls of churches, adding a counterpoint of ugliness and disorder to an otherwise immaculately designed cathedral. They were lewd, confusing, and downright disturbing — exactly like Garden.Medieval art used gargoyles to make a statement: if you don't live your life in harmony with the beauty and order that built the great cathedrals, you'll fall into a life of ugliness and chaos. Likewise, the horrors of The Garden of Earthly Delights serve a similarly indispensable purpose: they clear your vision so you can see the ugliness of self-gratification.The final panel of Bosch's masterpiece is rendered in such horrifying detail that only a true visionary could imagine. Its purpose, however, isn't mere shock value — because hidden below the veneer of abject terror is a deeper moral lesson, one that might inspire you to choose another direction for your life before it's too late...Thank you for reading!Remember, you can support us and get members-only content every weekend — great literature, art, and philosophy breakdowns.Paid readers can access our *entire* archive of premium articles right here.In the last year, we've written about everything from Milton's Paradise Lost, to why Tolkien hated Dune, to Dante's tips for reading the Bible (or any epic story)...",

This is part of a broader trend of states looking to European prisons, which experts say are much safer than those in the U.S. Michaela says:   The first time I went to prison I was eight years old — because my mom worked at court in Germany and wanted to show me what prison looked like. Probably contrary to what she wanted to achieve, I thought prison was great! The cells were comfy, with TVs, and looked more like dorm rooms to me. Now U.S. prisons are trying to learn from European prisons, because they have much lower rates of violence and relapse.

When complete, the Great Bear Sea network will connect “ecological hotspots that will act like underwater stepping stones” from Vancouver Island to Alaska. Becca says:   One thing that’s unique about this network is that it will be collaboratively managed by federal, provincial and Indigenous governments.

      "publishedAt": "2025-07-30T14:10:07.000Z",
      "content": "So, let's talk about Mary's Room. The thought experiment is this. Mary is a super-genius who likes to study the science of color vision. She reads a bunch of text books, internet sources, and academic papers about the subject, and even remotely performs her own experiments on color. Indeed, she is so great a scientist that she eventually learns everything there is no know about color and vision. She knows all about pigments, how things appear a certain way based on the wavelengths of the photons that hit your eye, every minute detail about the eye and the signals that are sent to the brain, how the brain process the information, etc. Truly, as far as physics and biology go, she knows everything about color and vision. The twist: Mary has never seen any color but black, white, and grey. She lives in a black-and-white room, her computer generates no color, her textbooks don't have colored images, and her remote experiments only give her a black-and-white video feed. She's been in this room her whole life. One day, she decides to leave, and the first thing she sees is an ice-cold Mountain Dew: Code Red. It seems, then, she would say, \"Wow, how beautiful! So that's what red actually looks like!\" The question: did Mary learn something new upon seeing the Code Red? It seems so; she learned what red looks like, not just what happens in the brain when a human sees red. But did she learn a fact? So it would seem.1 But did she learn a new physical fact? It would seem not, since if what she learned were just some physical truth, then she could have read about it in her black-and-white room. So it seems like there are non-physical facts, such as the fact of what redness looks like. Therefore, mental properties such as what red looks like, what Code Red tastes like, etc. are non-physical, so we need to go beyond physics to explain the mind. This is called the \"Knowledge Argument\" against the idea that the mind is physical. I used to have a really annoying and complicated reply to the argument, but now I have one that I think is better, cleaner, and most importantly, fun.2 Here's one standard reply to the Knowledge Argument. The idea is that Mary doesn't learn a new fact, but rather the same fact under a new guise. What on Earth does that mean? Consider this example. \"Eminem\" and \"Marshall Mathers\" are the same guy. So, it seems that \"Eminem is a rapper\" and \"Marshall Mathers is a rapper\" are the same fact—they're both just the fact that this particular guy is a rapper. But a perfectly rational and consistent person might know that Eminem is a rapper without knowing Marshall Mathers is a rapper—imagine meeting Eminem without realizing he's Eminem, he introduces himself as Marshall Mathers, and you think he's just some guy. In this case, do you know the fact that the man is a rapper? On the one hand, the man is in fact Eminem, and you know Eminem is a rapper; on the other hand, you don't know Marshall is a rapper. So, some philosophers of language like to say that there's only one fact, and that you know the fact under one guise but not the other. We don't need to worry too much about the terminology here. When it comes to the propositions that Eminem is a rapper and that Marshall Mathers is a rapper, there's something in common; we say what they have in common by saying they're the same fact.3 There's also something different about them: knowing one doesn't mean you know the other. Therefore, we say there are two different guises, and you might know a fact under one guise but not another. So, as the initial response to Mary's Room goes, Mary does not, in fact, learn a new fact once she sees the Mountain Dew: Code Red, a fact about what redness really looks like. Rather, she learns the same fact about redness that she learned in her textbooks, but under a new guise, or mode of presentation. A new way of apprehending the same fact. Likewise, you might come to learn Marshall Mathers is a rapper without learning a new fact. Thus, since there is no new fact Mary learns, there is no need to suppose that there are non-physical facts. But wait a minute. Usually, if a person knows a fact under one guise but not another, it's because they're ignorant of some other fact, a linking fact. For example, you do not know Marshall Mathers is a rapper because there is a distinct fact you are ignorant of, such as that the man you just met is the same guy who sung Cleanin' Out my Closet. If Mary is ignorant of some such linking fact—such as \"So this is how things appear when my brain is stimulated in such-and-such a manner\"—is that a physical fact, or a non-physical fact? If it is a physical fact, then surely it's one of the things she could have learned in her room, so that she does not learn anything new when she sees the Mountain Dew: Code Red. But, it seems, she does learn something she could not have learned in her black-and-white room. Therefore, it seems like she learns a non-physical fact anyway.4 Cue me. What do I say? Well, my claim is that upon seeing the Code Red she does learn something she could have only learned by seeing it for herself, something she could not have learned if she stayed in her room, something you can only learn by first-person visual acquaintance. Yet what she learns is just a physical fact, albeit a first-person-dependent physical fact that can only be learned by getting the information sent to her brain in a particular way. My position is that, metaphysically, the fact she learns is a physical one, one describable third-personally by physics. Yet, at the level of the concept or meaning of what Mary apprehends, this meaning ineliminably refers to her relationship to some information via visual processing. That's my claim. It would be helpful to talk about what I think is a somewhat parallel case. It has to do with what's called de se knowledge, that is, knowledge about oneself. It's a pretty puzzling matter. What do I know when I know that I have brown hair? It is not the same as knowing \"Flo has brown hair,\" for I could be ignorant that I am Flo. I could get amnesia, forget that I am Flo, look in a mirror, and come to believe I have brown hair without being committed to thinking Flo has brown hair. I would first need to learn empirically that a certain linking fact holds, namely, that I am Flo. Perhaps what I know is \"The person speaking this sentence has brown hair.\" But, again, we could imagine a strange case where I form a belief that the sentence is being spoken by someone with brown hair, somehow unaware that I am the one speaking the sentence. This would be strange, but not inconsistent, not as if I believed \"Eminem is a rapper\" while failing to believe that someone is a rapper. No, it seems any linking fact between \"I have brown hair\" and \"X has brown hair\" would have to involve the \"I\" (where \"X\" is some description of a person not making use of the \"I\"). To know these facts are the same, I have to know \"I am X.\" And that's fine! I can't know that I have brown hair just by learning some third-personally-describable facts. I need to know, in addition, where I stand in relation to these facts. I need to take notice of my mental activity, see the correlation between that and some stuff happening in the world, and from that infer that I am a particular being in the world. Yet, just because the \"I\" is referred to in any linking fact between \"I have brown hair\" and \"X has brown hair,\" and so the linking fact cannot be third-personally describable from my point of view, we do not seem to be required to suppose first-person facts are beyond the physical. My ultimate view about the self is that the concept of the \"I\" is not reducible to anything not explicitly referring to the self or one's own representations.5 But this just means we have a weird, irreducible concept, not a new ingredient of reality. We can perfectly well explain, from a physicalistic perspective, what agents are doing when they make judgments involving \"I\" and why they do it. There's no rule saying that, just because a being is physical, it can or should only use concepts that can be defined in terms of the physical. I think a lot of concepts work like this, including normative concepts. Making a judgment about what one ought to or may do is a way of expressing plans for how to live. The word \"ought,\" itself, cannot be defined in terms of the physical, or anything non-normative. I can't say \"By definition, an agent ought to X if and only if [physical stuff about X].\"6 Yet, we do not need to posit strange non-natural properties to explain the normative. On this view of the meaning of \"ought,\" we can perfectly well explain why agents in a physical world use normative concepts, why they must use them, why some ways of using them are rational and others not, etc. Again, the concept is irreducible, but that doesn't mean we need to add extra ingredients to reality. So, as you're expecting, I say the same about Mary's Room. But before describing my position, I should say a bit about color in general. This will be a heavily simplified story, but I hope it expresses what I want to say adequately. From a third-person point of view, all there is to having color vision is the ability to distinguish between the relevant properties of objects via sensitivity to the wavelengths of light they reflect. We may say, at a first pass (!), that from an objective point of view the only difference between seeing red and seeing blue is that the agent is aware that they are different. This difference is something just immediately accessible to the agent. The agent can also immediately discern similarity and difference among very many different objects, including objects they can only access via memory. As a consequence, different objects will be sorted into different equivalence classes, two objects being equivalent if the agent perceives them as similar. The different equivalence classes are the different colors the agent can perceive. Upon seeing an object, they immediately apprehend which equivalent class it goes into, i.e. what color it is. The agent does not infer which equivalence class it goes into; they do not consciously sort of the object on the basis of the wavelengths of the light, on the brain signal caused, etc., because they might not know about that stuff. Rather, they just immediate access the fact that the object belongs to a certain equivalence class. Understanding the above, how will the agent understand their experiences? Well, they will just see the way something looks, and thereby know what color it is. The red things and the blue things will just seem different. Since this information they get is something they just immediately get, they will have no way to say what the difference between red and blue is except that they look different.7 The red things will just have some inexplicable quality that they know to be red. You would be right to feel there should be something more going on; the story I tell is consistent with the intrinsic redness just looking different from how it actually looks, e.g. if the agent perceives red things with the quality that I call \"blueness.\" This is a separate argument, though; for today, I am merely concerned with what Mary learns. I briefly address color-spectrum inversion here. In brief: when I think enough about spectrum inversion, it really, truly seems to me to be impossible, and so it really, truly seems to me that the story I've told here captures the intuitive features of consciousness. Now, back to Mary. What does she learn when she steps out of her room and sees the Mountain Dew: Code Red? Well, simply that the object belongs to a new equivalence class from the ones she has so far sorted things into. From her perspective, she is just immediately made conscious of the fact that the object has some property that has never been made immediately conscious to her through this route before. There is nothing she can say other than that this object belongs to an equivalence class different from all the others. What is the linking fact between \"This is what a Code Red looks like\" and \"This is the brain-response to seeing a Code Red\" (the latter of which she could have already known)? Well, given Mary's excellent color-knowledge, the new fact she learns would be something like \"This equivalence class is the one that corresponds to such-and-such brain activity.\" Since the \"This equivalence class\" is something made immediately known to her—her brain just tells her, so to speak, which objects go in which classes—it's not as if she could have learned this fact from reading a book. The \"This\" in \"This equivalence class\" means the one she is being made immediately aware of, and she cannot make a judgment of the relation between the class and brain activity except by being made aware of her brain activity in an indirect way, via (i) the immediate awareness of what class the Code Red belongs to, in conjunction with (ii) third-personal knowledge of how brains respond to seeing Code Red.8 Put loosely, but hopefully more intuitively: on my view, the quality of a color is a relation between the subject and an object via the specific route through which the subject is made immediately aware of a property of the object. You cannot know beforehand what a color will look like because you cannot know beforehand how all the third-personal physical facts relate to the manner in which you are made immediately aware of color-properties. In the same manner, I cannot know I am Flo by learning just third-personal facts; I have to observe my own mental activity in relation to the third-personal facts. Joe Schmid, of the YouTube channel The Majesty of Reason (claimed by at least one person to be the objectively best YouTube Channel), heard a provisional version of what I say here, and brought up the worry that what I say is incompatible with a priori physicalism (that is, the idea that physical facts necessitate mental facts, and the connection between the two is knowable a priori). For a priori physicalists, generally, want to say that all the facts about consciousness are knowable from physical facts that can be described from the third person. I hold, in contrast, that what it is like to see red is a physical but irreducibly first-personal fact. Everything I've said up to this point seems true to me, and if it means I have to ditch a priori physicalism as it is usually understood, then I would be happy to do so. The sort of thing that would worry me is concluding that, for example, philosophical zombies are conceivable, so that we cannot rule out a priori that a possible being physically identical to me might lack any subjective experience. They don't seem conceivable to me, and also, I'd have a lot of new philosophical problems to worry about if they were. I don't know if believing that zombies are inconceivable is sufficient to class me as an a priori physicalist; if it is, then I will shortly argue that my view is compatible with a priori physicalism. If it is not sufficient, then I am happy to be classified as a non-a priori physicalist. So, why do I say zombies are inconceivable? Well, because given what I have said, if learning what it is like to see red amounts to perceiving an object and immediately apprehending which equivalence class it belongs to, then we can tell a priori that, for a being physically identical to me, there will be something it is like to see red. Someone with perfect physical knowledge would know that everything I say above would apply to humans, be able to know that we will perceive different colors as having some inscrutable immediately accessible properties, which amounts to there being something it is like to see those colors. But learning what in particular it is like to see those colors would be a relation between one's own faculties and the object, so something one can only learn by seeing for oneself. So, in sum, I do think that what it is like to be in a certain physical state is only knowable a posteriori, given the strange but I-think-correct account of \"knowing what something is like\" given above. I don't think this fact raises any problem for physicalism, or commits me to the conceivability of philosophical zombies, spectrum inversion, etc., though I don't know whether I still count as an a priori physicalist. I'm pretty confident, now, that the Knowledge Argument doesn't work. Don't get me wrong—if you came in sympathetic to anti-physicalist arguments, and you still feel like there's something left over—the intrinsic redness—that has not been explained why what I have said, I don't think I've said anything that should change your mind. But I think what you're getting at is an intuition that is better isolated by e.g. the apparent conceivability of zombies and spectrum inversion, and that apparent conceivability is doing all the intuitive work in one's feelings that there is something left over for the physicalist to explain in the case of Mary. I don't think the Knowledge Argument, as such, is threatening to the physicalist. Moral Law Within is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.1Some disagree with this premise, thinking she learns not a new fact, but a new ability. I'll appeal to talk about abilities here, but I grant that Mary does get some new propositional knowledge. 2For these realizations of mine, I am indebted to conversations with Joe Schmid, Amos Wollen, and Noah McKay (especially for how I put the dialectic up until I say \"Cue me\"). I should also note that I would be surprised if what I say later is not already in the literature somewhere. The \"different guise\" objection to Mary's Room and the reply is standard, but everything after that is my own, though I am probably not the first whose own it is. 3If you are about to complain about me conflating facts and propositions, you did not need these two paragraphs anyway. 4The dialectic so far can be found in Chalmers' The Conscious Mind, p. 141. 5As we all know, the I posits itself as pure self-positing. 6Sure, I can say \"An agent ought to do something if not doing it violates the Formula of Universal Law,\" but such a fact cannot simply be read off the definition of \"ought.\" Rather, it is a substantive truth about what we ought to do. 7I am not using facts about what the agent can articulate to argue against the idea that nothing more is going on. Here I am describing my position as to what is going on. 8Chalmers addresses the comparison to the case of de se knowledge. It seems to me the cruz of his response is: \"This loophole allows through a single piece of irreducible indexical knowledge (the location of a centered world's center) without ontological cost, but nothing further. Once the location of a center is specified, the loophole is closed. The phenomenal facts remain unsettled even when the location of a center is specified, so conscious experience remains out in the cold\" (The Conscious Mind, p. 144). So, if I'm not mistaken, Chalmers is arguing that appeal to irreducibly indexical knowledge doesn't work because Mary would still learn something new even if she knew the centered world she occupied (which agent she is, at what time, etc.) from within her room. I think I just disagree with his claim that \"Once the location of a center is specified, the loophole is closed\"; I think we have more irreducibly indexical knowledge than can be specified by a choice of agent, place, and time. (This is established by the criticism of Chalmers' two-dimensional semantics from Hawthorne & Yli-Vakkuri's Narrow Content; I don't think their observation rules out narrow content in general, but it does show that narrow content has to account for more indexical information than Chalmers first thinks).I think you should accept my reply to Chalmers here regardless of your views on phenomenality. After all, the supposed philosophical zombie works exactly the way I describe us as working above; they know which objects have which color-properties, simply because the equivalence classes the objects belong to are made immediately accessible to them, albeit without association with phenomenal properties (by hypothesis). So it follows that the zombie has some kind of irreducibly indexical or irreducibly related-to-the-subject knowledge that is not settled by the centered world they occupy.",

      "publishedAt": "2025-07-30T13:55:31.000Z",
      "content": "Many people use GDP to make claims about changes in people's welfare over time. This is entirely reasonable, and would likely be correlated with any reasonable measure of people's welfare. It is not, however, perfect, and it will miss things. First, it often does not include many things which we might find valuable, such as leisure, life expectancy, total population, and household production, and may not track onto utility if there is inequality and non-linear utility as a function of wealth. Second, GDP cannot adequately capture the gains to utility from free goods, in particular the Internet. Relatedly, goods with markups will not be able to state. Third, the way in which we treat investment arbitrarily increases GDP in places with higher capital intensities. The first two are actually quite intimately related to each other, as I will show.GDP is intended to be the resources available for consumption. It does not take into account our productivity in making it. If a country works longer hours than another, they will have a higher GDP, but we cannot say that they are really better off. Likewise, if we live longer we will have more time in which to consume, but we would not pick up on this except insofar as it affects our total national consumption. Jones and Klenow (2016) is one such example, where they ask how much you would have to compensate someone to accept living in a country which has all the traits of another, but for, say, life expectancy. You can also do something similar for positive and negative externalities which do not turn up in changes in production. They arrive at this by fitting equations representing a utility function using microdata. Later work by them and others considers different ethical beliefs around having more people alive. The same GDP per capita, but with more people around to experience it, is probably better, and so Adhami, Bils, Jones, and Klenow (2025) argue that the growth in poor countries in underrated. I don't necessarily believe the value that we put on a human life, but it's a fine starting point. Ultimately what we need to do is put implicit prices on things which don't have explicit ones.Subscribe nowWe do this for some stuff. Household production is estimated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, in parallel to GDP, in the household production satellite account (or HPSA). This is fairly simple compared to the other things we'll have to estimate later, as much of what we do in the house has an implicit price in the market which we can compare to. Providing childcare can be done by a parent or by a nanny, and cooking can be done by the family or by a restaurant, all of which have prices. (As far as I know, we do not impute the benefits of lovemaking in the household by consulting the price of prostitutes, although I understand the staff of the BEA to be quite keen on the idea). This can be easily integrated into national accounts, and especially when proportions shift as during Covid, will greatly shift your understanding of what happened to actual consumption. This also leads to the apparent advantage of Europe in leisure being somewhat illusory. They do more work at home, and their leisure isn't really leisurely.For stuff with no obvious market price, a reasonable approach is to argue, for some goods, that we don't really need to. Suppose Wikipedia replaced our spending on encyclopedias. Holding working hours fixed, we would simply spend more on other items, which will show up in GDP. If we reduce our working hours, then this returns to leisure as before, and we can apply the same work. What we will miss, though, is any excess utility from the free service. We can't measure the consumer surplus.Related to this are the effects of markups on welfare. Imagine a monopolist selling a single good. They will curtail production to maximize the profit they get. We can easily imagine a world in which the monopolist faces a marginal cost curve such that total expenditures at the profit maximizing price is the same as one where price is at the marginal cost. Since we find GDP from expenditures, we would say that these two scenarios have identical GDP. The internet is simply a special case of this, where the marginal cost is approximately zero, and thus any distortion away from marginal price (which would be a reduction in welfare) shows up as an increase in GDP.One method of including them is to try and look at the time spent using a service. Goolsbee and Klenow (2006) is an early paper along this line. They argue that, at the margin, people allocate their time in such a way as to maximize utility. If people choose to consume the internet instead of doing other things, they must regard it as better. Unfortunately their data is not necessarily the best – I do not believe that people are trading off only between working and using the internet – but the method allows us to put numbers on how much people value the internet (which they estimate, in 2006, to be about $3000 per person).This is similar to the argument of Feldstein (1999) about finding the deadweight loss from income taxation. There are a few ways in which we can change our behavior to avoid income taxes – we can reduce our hours worked, obviously, but we can also change the form of consumption. Since these must have the same utility at the margin, all we need is the total change in taxable income.I believe a similar approach can be used for leisure. If countries work different amounts due to differences in tax rates, and not due to differences in preferences, then we can perhaps abstract away from leisure entirely. Of course, this would seem to imply that the preference of consumers is to work all hours, and we don't do so only due to taxes. In any event, this has been a detour to be picked up later – back to sounder footing.You can also conduct experiments to discover the value which people place upon a good. Brynjolfsson, Collis, Diewert, Eggers, and Fox (2019) simply ask people what they are willing to pay for things such as the camera in a smartphone, or how much they would need to be paid to give up a good. Note again that it is ambiguous as to whether this over or underestimates the benefit to society, as these free goods – or really any goods – can have positive or negative externalities, but you at least capture the value to the user. They estimate that Facebook alone has added between .05 and .11 percentage points in growth annually to the United States.The last objection to GDP is its treatment of investment. GDP counts only final goods, not intermediates. We would very obviously not want to arbitrarily inflate GDP by counting the value of iron ore and pig iron and steel and railroad tracks separately. However, many final goods are in fact intermediaries to the production of something else later. Take the railroad tracks – they will enter GDP once when we take their value as a finished good, and then again through boosting production by transporting goods hither and thither. A country which has relatively more investment will have arbitrarily higher GDP than one which has less.This problem is brought up by Robert Barro in \"Double-counting Investment\" (2020), which is a generalization of the argument of Koh, Santaeulalia-Llopis, and Zheng (2019) that the observed decline in the labor share in income is actually entirely due to including intellectual property in national income statistics, instead of as an intermediate good. Capital isn't actually getting all that much more income – instead, we're counting the payments to produce these intermediate goods as final goods.We already adjust for this with housing. We don't count houses when they're produced toward GDP. Rather, we view the house as an investment which produces a flow of lodging. We estimate what it would cost to rent the place, and have that be the contribution of the house to GDP for each period.The main difficulty is that it is really, really hard to separate out consumption from investment. Suppose someone buys a truck. Part of the value of a truck is that you can ship goods from one place to another, which is an intermediate input into other goods. We wouldn't want to count goods which are shipped around a lot as more valuable than goods which aren't shipped around, so we deduct it out of GDP; but at the same time, we also buy trucks because they're cool and honk-honk and vroom-vroom and wheeee and big truck makes me big man. We don't know how much of our purchase was due to each part, and thus cannot subtract out only part.This has been a discussion of how GDP can be improved. I would caution, however, against shallow cynicism that denies any usefulness of GDP. Any reasonable measure of economic welfare will be correlated with GDP. As Jones and Klenow note, their adjusted measure has a correlation of 0.98 with GDP. The rich countries of the world are indeed much richer than the poor countries, and the poor countries have really grown by a ton. Including other sources of gains into GDP tends to increase, not decrease, the gains which poor countries have experienced, and shows them as being closer to the West than GDP would indicate. For example, while GDP has not consistently improved in Africa, life expectancy has greatly increased. GDP isn't perfect, but that's hardly a reason to think the world hasn't gotten better.If you would like to put a price on a free good yourself, please subscribe!",

      "content": "[\"One Third of a Nation,\" by O. Louis Gugliemi, from the Met Collection]A few months back, I argued that political scientists should read Chris Hayes' fantastic book, The Siren's Call, and Chris's subsequent conversation with Ezra Klein, to understand the relationship between the attention economy and politics. Some weeks back, Ezra and Chris had a follow-up conversation about Mamdani's primary victory in New York, which I've been thinking about ever since. Below is an attempt to remix that conversation above the beats of other, more academic discussions with Hahrie Han, Nate Matias, Marion Fourcade and Cosma Shalizi amongst others. None of the above are to blame for any stupidities, and I'm not sure that this proposed synthesis will work. But even if it doesn't, the mistakes might be useful. So here goes.Subscribe nowThe background to the conversation is that (a) there is something obviously not working in how Democrats communicate with ordinary people, and (b) Mamdani seems to be connecting better than other Democrats, at least to New York primary voters. But the most interesting parts of the discussion are those that go well beyond the particulars. Ezra and Chris both believe that this problem won't be fixed by One Weird Trick or Discovering the Liberal Joe Rogan. They see the problem as symptomatic of a more systematic failure. Rather than just figuring out how to get voters to tick the right box, they are both convinced that there is a fundamental mismatch between the way we do politics and the environment that we do politics in. I think that what they are looking for is an understanding of democracy that is better at generating and organizing useful variety in Brian Eno's sense, while also being more politically robust. Put slightly differently, their problem is the following. How can you build a new mode of politics that is both (a) usefully experimental, and (b) capable of getting and sustaining sufficient public attention to be politically viable?Of course, the difficulty in the US context, as in many other countries,* is that we are starting from a very bad place. In the U.S., both the Republicans and Democrats are what Daniel Schlozman and Sam Rosenfeld call \"hollow parties,\" political organizations that are largely incapable of doing the job they are supposed to. Fixing the Republican party looks impossible right now, but the Democrats aren't much better. As Schlozman and Rosenfeld put it in a recent essay, the Democratic party is best described as a series of ineffectual gestures towards a political environment that it obviously don't understand:from the geriatric TikTok videos to the little bingo paddles House members waved at Trump's address to Congress to the feckless inside-baseball legislative maneuvering. ...less a political party than a vehicle for institutional self-consciousness Chris is kinder in emphasizing that Democratic communications tend to be more inwardly than outwardly focused.Democratic Party politics are really complicated politics of multiracial, multiethnic, multilingual coalitions. I think often the things that success in Democratic politics selects for is skill at managing these coalitional tensions, which is a really difficult thing to do. Hakeem Jeffries is very good at that. Nancy Pelosi is the best at it. There is much more that could be said about the reasons why this coalition is so fragile, but the more immediate problem is that this style of communication is very badly suited to the actually existing attention economy.No one — and I think including Nancy Pelosi — would be like: I want to listen to a Nancy Pelosi podcast. Nancy Pelosi is not a great public communicator. She is a legendary, all-time great manager of coalitional tension.I think the coalitional politics of Democratic politics often select for people who are very skilled at managing these very different, difficult coalitional issues. That is a different skill than public communication to the normies.As Ezra says, the fundamental problem is: you need to understand attention not as something other people gift to you but as something you earn yourself.Working in the new media environment is actually not about communicating existing priorities better. It is about building new and different connections between politics, policies and the public in a world where the machineries of the attention economy have fundamentally transformed those relationships.One way of bridging between Chris and Ezra's ideas and academic arguments, might be this. We talk a lot, both in broader conversation and specialied academic discussions about what the \"public\" believes and wants. The problem is that we cannot actually see the public directly, or even make out the beliefs and wants of the various micropublics (interest groups, parties, local organizations and the like) that are its constitutive parts. All of them are just too big, too complex and too inchoate to be visible as coherent entities. Hence, we rely on a variety of technologies to translate publics into simplified pictures that can be grasped more readily (what computer scientists might call 'lossy representations,' or physicists might call \"coarse-grainings\"). Take, for example opinion polls, which even at the best of times are dramatic simplifications of what the public believes on a particular issue, filtered through the polling questions, weighting decisions and statistical techniques. To some extent, it is reasonable to say that opinion polls don't measure publics so much as they make them. Much the same can be said of the eighteenth century coffee shops that were idealized in Jurgen Habermas's discussion of the public sphere, or twenty-first century social media platforms. All of these provide images of the public that flatten, distort, and to some extent actively create the public's beliefs and desires. These technologies shape publics, not just in the eyes of outside observers, but in the eyes of the putative members of the public themselves. If you are on social media, your understanding of what the public is - in the U.S, for example, your understanding of Democrats, Republicans and what they agree and disagree about - is shaped by the media that you participate in, the algorithms (whether they simply just present a flow in reverse chronology like Bluesky, or select some posts as Twitter/X does) that direct those media flows, and the social practices that users semi-spontaneously create within the broader affordances of the technology. Democratic publics, in short, are a partial by-product of the machineries of attention that Ezra and Chris are talking about. Different machineries will represent public opinion, will in part make publics in different ways, emphasizing this aspect of what they collectively believe and want, and discounting that other aspect.** Ezra and Chris worry that new media tend to flatten out the aspects of democratic discussion that make for a workable relationship between politics and policy.*** Ezra:The fundamental reality of the Twitter text box is that it's a compression mechanism.Chris:I do worry that the structural nature of public opinion now is negative in a way that makes even good governance not resonate with people. Or the structural limitations on governing — one of the two. That it's just very hard because of how many things contribute to a working-class person who lives on Fordham Road feeling the squeeze in every direction.That, then, is why Mamdani's primary victory is interesting to them. Not simply because he's more skilled at using TikTok than the modal Democratic politician, but because he's apparently trying to figure out how to meld a new mode of policy making with a new mode of public-making.As Ezra makes clear, it is hard to connect policy making to publics:Translating this kind of communication from campaign to governance — not that many people have had to do it. But Obama had to, and I think I would say he failed to do that. I think the sense is that he was an amazing campaigner. And then given the reality of incremental victory, he was never sort of able to narrativize that. ... I think that's in some ways why the liberalism he represented, after him, for at least some time, had a hard time because he had raised hopes so high for a lot of people. ... how do you narrativize the difference between people's hopes for your campaign and what they got? Donald Trump is interesting because he comes after Obama. He also makes huge, sweeping, wild promises. ... They don't build the wall. But Donald Trump has his way of communicating throughout his entire presidency.Simplifying crudely: Obama's approach works for a while, because he builds on the audacity of hope, but he delivers disappointment rather than transformative change, because that is what the system allows. Trump also makes big promises, but they are performative. It isn't clear that his public really expects him to deliver on them, and his partial political success partly rests on a radical disconnection between purported proposals and actual outcomes. So the question then is:Can you use this kind of communication mastery, this capability over attention, to generate force for the things you want to pass? Can you use it as a form of power? But then can you use it if you're not able to get it done?More specifically, Chris asks whether the new technologies meld with some new version of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's experimentalist approach to policy making. As FDR famously said in 1932:The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something. The millions who are in want will not stand by silently forever while the things to satisfy their needs are within easy reach.Chris sees Mamdani's approach as similar in some important ways.One thing I would say is, I like experimentation and new ideas. When [Mamdani] was asked about [publicly funded grocery stores] — I think it's in \"The Bulwark Podcast\" — he says: We'll try it, and if it doesn't work, c'est la vie. I love that answer. Politicians never give that answer. The person who really most embodied that spirit is F.D.R. If you go back and read about the first hundred days, they're just trying a lot. We now think about F.D.R. as this colossus who remade the relationship between the citizen and the federal government. A lot of that stuff did not work — like, fully failed. A lot of the interventions failed. They did a lot of clunky stuff. It was a totally different time. He had these enormous mandates, and it was a crisis. I like the idea of experimentation and these ideas coming from outside of the consensus around sensible policy. The test for it is: Can you deliver?As the last question suggests, it might not work now! The possible failure modes don't just involve Mamdani's particular strengths and weaknesses, but the fact that he is operating in a very different environment than FDR, and under different institutional constraints. But asking the question of how to do this seems to me to be exactly the right way to frame the problem. Given current circumstances, how can you build an experimentalist democracy, which can keep on trying things out to discover how to get out of the multiple intersecting crises that we find ourselves in? Can experimenting over new forms of communicating with the public reinforce experimenting with new ways of delivering policy, or do they cut against each other?Those are the big questions that we face. The Democratic party's crisis is one particular manifestation of it - a congeries of different groups that don't particularly trust each other and are more focused on their internal problems and rivalries than the external challenges that they face. It's enormously difficult to undertake bold, persistent experimentation under these circumstances, because every experiment is likely to piss off some key group or another.**** But if you look at the U.S. as a whole, the question reappears on a bigger scale. U.S. democracy is not built so much to solve problems so much as to dissipate political disagreements. Other countries face related dilemmas. So too for global politics.I keep on coming back to Brian Eno's description of what an adaptive organization ought look like as a practical description for how democracy ought work.An organism operating in this way must have something more than a centralized control structure. It must have a responsive network of subsystems capable of autonomous behaviour, and it must regard the irregularities of the environment as a set of opportunities around which it will shape and adjust its own identity.In practice, this implies regular and repeated experimentation, investigating the irregularities of the environment and figuring out possible responses to them. This is an apt framework to understand both parties trying to appeal to the public, and policy makers trying to get things done. Reconciling the two aspects of experimentation - generating new variant relationships with the public that are compatible with new ways of solving the public's problems - is the most fundamental challenge of democracy.So how can you build political parties, broader publics, democratic systems and global institutions that will do this? In particular, can you make this system robust given the particular compression mechanisms and machineries of attention that we have right now? Can you engage in piecemeal democratic engineering (itself experimental) to make these systems more responsive to our actual problems? These are enormous challenges, which need to be addressed practically, rather than from abstract theoretical first principles. Even so, you still need to get the questions right to get started. I found Ezra and Chris's conversation enormously helpful in thinking about those questions. Possibly, you will too.Update: When writing, I hadn't seen this really interesting Greg Sargent article on the intricacies of the Mamdani team's approach to social media.Subscribe now* Schlozman and Rosenfeld's diagnosis, discussed right below, shares much common ground with Peter Mair's posthumous book, Ruling the Void, on the failure of party politics in the UK and Europe.** Here, I'm simplifying. Hahrie and I have a piece coming out very soon, where we define a democratic public as \"an evolving, living relationship between the people who collectively constitute it, and the feedback loops (technologically mediated or otherwise) that allow them to understand themselves as a collective and act accordingly.\" More soon on the evolving, living part of publics, as opposed to the technological channeling thereof.*** As an aside - one of the reasons that the Democrat mainstream may be increasingly out of touch is that the filters that it deploys to understand the public may be increasingly out of sync with the mechanisms through which the public understands itself. Elected politicians rely on opinion polls, and are mostly members of the demographics that watch cable and network TV, rather than following influencer beefs, or diving headfirst into the endless feed of YouTube etc. I have no idea of how to investigate whether this hypothesis is true, but it seems at least superficially plausible.**** This includes centrists and moderates. People who deplore the \"groups\" as the fundamental problem of the Democratic party are themselves often attached to a faction that reacts splenetically whenever its interests are threatened by some possible political compromise.",

      "content": "these are only the people James Holmes killed; the 70 that he wounded would not fit comfortably in my newsletterI am indebted to my friend Xun for his help in reviewing my methodological interpretation of the offending paper; I would not have had the confidence to publish this post without his knowledge and advice.Recently, the New York Fed published an astonishingly irresponsible analysis about involuntary psychiatric hospitalization, the practice of forcing someone into mental health treatment if they're considered a danger to themselves or others. Researchers for the Fed found that patients who they consider \"judgment calls\" who are involuntarily committed to psychiatric care have significantly worse outcomes in terms of suicidality and later criminality compared to those who are not. These patients are judgment calls because they provoked discordant analysis from doctors who evaluated them, that is, one doctor said that they met the criteria for involuntary treatment, while another said that they did not. The paper argues that involuntary hospitalization actually makes things worse in those cases and based on those outcomes. According to their findings, people who are hospitalized this way are more likely to die by suicide or overdose and more likely to be charged with violent crimes in the months following their release. I believe that this paper is deeply flawed thanks to basic issues of unbalanced psychiatric severity between groups, issues with conditioning on a collider, a quasi-experimental design that cannot address these issues because its assumptions are untrue, and an inadequate sample size to address the scarcity of outcomes of interest (that is, that suicide, overdose, and violent crime are rare events in the data set).Put simply, the study tries to make the causal claim that hospitalization of \"judgement call\" patients who receive discordant evaluations from different doctors causes worse outcomes. But if the people being hospitalized were sicker to begin with, then any comparison in post-hospitalization outcomes is contaminated by that preexisting difference. The worse outcomes might simply reflect baseline severity, not any harmful effect of hospitalization. It's a classic confound: if illness severity affects both the treatment (hospitalization) and the outcomes (death, crime), then it's a confounder, and failing to control for it adequately breaks causal inference. And it's a problem here because the rates of serious mental illness are so unequal across the study's treatment categories. The study attempts to use a quasi-experimental design to address this kind of shortcoming, but success depends on two assumptions we have every reason to doubt - that patients are randomly assigned to doctors and that doctors only affect outcomes through the decision to hospitalize, nether of which is convincing. Let's get into it.Who Are These People and Who's Evaluating Their Work?None of the study's three authors have any meaningful training in psychiatric medicine. Natalia Emanuel is a microeconomist for the Fed of New York whose \"research focuses on understanding the informal labor market, workplace policies that help firms and workers thrive, and child welfare and criminal justice systems.\" Pim Welle is an engineer whose background is in using satellite data in environmental science. Valentin Bolotnyy is an economist and fellow with the far-right Hoover Institution, which employs a mix of cold warriors, market fundamentalists, and right-wing libertarians. None of them appears to have any serious exposure to psychiatric training or medicine; given their very impressive academic credentials (credentials I conspicuously don't have) they almost certainly do not have long-term experience in inpatient care themselves (experience I conspicuously do have). It's rather remarkable that the Fed of New York would publish such a paper at all, given the lack of relevant experience or expertise among the researchers and the fact that the research is so far outside of their ordinary purview. The paper has not received peer review from a major psychiatric journal. This work is essentially unrefereed. The Problem with the Quasi-Experimental DesignThe authors didn't run a traditional randomized controlled trial, where you flip a (metaphorical) coin to decide who gets hospitalized and who doesn't. In fairness, that would be ethically and practically impossible. Instead, they used a quasi-experimental design, which in this case could be considered a kind of natural experiment. In this case, the experiment comes from how patients are assigned to different doctors in emergency rooms. When someone comes into the ER for a psychiatric evaluation, they're randomly (or semi-randomly...) assigned to one of several doctors. Some doctors are more likely to hospitalize people than others. So, by comparing outcomes for people who just happened to see a more \"hospitalize-happy\" (strict) doctor versus a less \"hospitalize-happy\" (lenient) one, the authors try to estimate the effect of being hospitalized.This is called a \"judge IV\" design. \"IV\" stands for \"instrumental variable,\" a statistical trick used to isolate the causal effect of a treatment when you can't run a proper experiment. Such designs are useful because there are a lot of scenarios where you just can't run a true experiment, such as this one. But these designs are also fragile. For this method to work, several things need to be true:The doctor a given patient sees really is random. Doctors only affect outcomes through the decision to hospitalize, not in other ways.In particular, we absolutely need the types of patients seen by lenient doctors to not be meaningfully different from those seen by strict doctors.These are big assumptions, and if they don't hold, the results can be biased. And I think five minutes of reflection will demonstrate the problems here.The authors claim that patients are randomly assigned to doctors based on a triage list, but they also admit that this process isn't perfectly random. Sometimes specific doctors are assigned on purpose, for example, if a patient is a frequent visitor who's been seen before, or if they're a child or elderly and need a specialist. You can imagine all manner of casual, undocumented breaks from this \"random\" selection of doctors - maybe one doctor prefers patients from particular backgrounds and subtly pushes to see more of them, maybe a triage nurse has a grudge against a particular doctor, maybe another doctor takes strategic lunch breaks to avoid certain patients. Who knows? The Fed researchers certainly don't. Even small breaks in the asserted randomness of doctors assigned to cases could potentially severely skew the results. If stricter doctors tend to get the most severe cases, or more experienced ones handle the hardest ones, then we can't assume everything evens out in the wash, and note that this doesn't have to be a formal policy of the institution for it to happen consistently. Just the fact that doctors have schedules can break this assertion of randomness; if stricter doctors are assigned to a particular time slot for nonrandom reasons (very possible) and particular patients are most likely to get evaluated at particular times of the day/week (almost certain) then hey presto, the whole design breaks and we have no practical ability to assess such tendencies in any robust way. The second assumption is potentially even worse. Of course doctors affect outcomes in ways other than in decision to hospitalize! The whole logic of the study depends on doctors affecting outcomes only by deciding whether to hospitalize a patient or not. But doctors aren't robots. They might interact differently with patients, give different advice, refer people to different outpatient services, or write different notes that influence how patients are treated later. Some doctors might have special relationships with other practitioners or programs that end up resulting in meaningful differences in treatment. If those things affect outcomes (and they do) then we can't isolate the effect of hospitalization. We're also picking up the effect of having a certain kind of doctor. This is what's called a violation of the exclusion restriction, and it's a common problem in instrumental variable designs.If patients who end up with \"lenient\" or \"strict\" doctors are systematically different in ways we don't see in the data then the whole thing collapses. For example, if people with more resources or stronger support systems tend to show up at certain times of day (and therefore see certain doctors), then we might be picking up those differences, not the effect of hospitalization. The authors try to test for this by checking whether patient characteristics like age, race, and insurance status vary across doctors. I find this woefully inadequate as a control. I can think of all sorts of unmeasured things, like severity of symptoms, family dynamics, comorbid disorders, past trauma, etc, that could still bias the results. Indeed, I would argue that demographic characteristics are almost useless to establish homogeneity this way. What matters is psychiatric factors, more than anything, which we don't have any real information about, and anyway all manner of lurking variables could mess this all up. The design only works if the complier group (those influenced by the doctor's preferences) is reasonably balanced, and it's not.Unequal Rates of Underlying SMI Are a Big Issue Without Random Assignment to TreatmentThe research they've produced has issues with highly unequal rates in core variables of across groups, which are supposedly addressed by that quasi-experimental design. Let's start with a simple but very serious issue. The authors of this study compare three groups:People who were involuntarily hospitalized.People who were not hospitalized.A middle group, called \"compilers,\" who are sort of in-between - people who would have been hospitalized by some doctors but not others.The researchers then look at these groups to see how they compare to each other in terms of the output variables, which in this study concern the rate of patients dying from suicide or overdose and the rate of patients engaging in future criminal acts. So what's the problem? The problem is that a key variable, the rate of serious mental illness (SMI), in each of these groups is very different.In the hospitalized group, nearly 48% have a serious mental illness.In the non-hospitalized group, only about 29% do.In the middle group - the \"compliers\" who are the main focus of the study - it's about 38%.That's a 20-point spread between the hospitalized and non-hospitalized groups. That level of imbalance tells us the groups are fundamentally different in ways that almost certainly affect the outcomes of interest (suicide, overdose, violence). The authors acknowledge some of this heterogeneity (like in pg. 18) but understate its threat to causal inference.Imagine you're trying to figure out whether giving someone antibiotics causes them to feel better. You give the antibiotics to people with severe infections and don't give them to people with mild colds. Then you check to see who actually gets better. Surprise - the people with the colds recover more often! But that doesn't mean the antibiotics made people worse or even failed to make them better. It just means that you gave them to the people who were sicker in the first place. This has been such a major part of the (often deliberate) misinterpretation of Covid-19 vaccination data that I'm surprised there isn't better communal statistical literacy about this. Something like that is what's going on here. The people who were hospitalized had much more severe mental illnesses than the ones who weren't. That alone could explain why they had worse outcomes. Even if hospitalization helped, it might not be enough to cancel out how much more unwell they were to begin with. And you can't wiggle out of this by saying that we're only paying attention to the compliers group because it's the selection of that group itself that breaks generalizability.Again, the issue is a confounded variable. Some third factor (here severity of illness) could be influencing both the treatment (hospitalization) and the outcome (death or crime). When that happens, it's really hard to isolate the effect of the treatment itself. Another way to express it is with the term conditioning on a collider. The study's sample includes only people who were brought in for evaluation under the standard of \"danger to self or others.\" This is a highly selective and unusual group; they're already flagged as being in crisis, and someone like a cop, doctor, or family member has decided they might need to be forcibly treated. You could think of the group as being selected based on two broad factors: psychiatric severity (e.g., schizophrenia, suicidality) and behavioral crisis (e.g., violence, aggression, substance use). You don't have to choose those two selection criteria, mind you, you just have to be aware that they are distinct variables that could each increase the probability of being referred for an involuntary evaluation. That means that even if psychiatric severity and violence are strongly related in the population, they might appear negatively correlated in the evaluated group, just because of how the selection process works. But of course those factors also influence who will later criminally offend or die by suicide.That's conditioning on a collider; it's also a textbook example of Berkson's paradox, a statistical curio where if you have an artificial cutpoint you can often generate specious negative correlations. A famous example is that, among NBA players, basketball ability and height are not correlated, which is surprising because of what we know about the population of NBA players. (As a group, they are very tall.) But the perceived lack of correlation is an artifact of the artificial cutpoint \"among NBA players\"; people who are tall but not very good at basketball have still traditionally had a path to the league - think of the Shawn Bradleys, tall stiffs who make rosters simply because of height - while people who are neither tall nor good at basketball don't make the league and are excluded from the sample. That means that you have a quadrant that cuts against the correlation (tall but not good) while a quadrant that would increase the correlation (short and not good) is systematically eliminated from your sample. In other words, the cutpoint has manufactured the appearance of a lack of correlation. That's Berkson's paradox. Think about the study design like this. IfHospitalization decisions are based more on behavioral reasons (e.g., intoxication, domestic violence), andThose not hospitalized tend to be in crisis for more perceived psychiatric severity (e.g., psychosis), Then you get:A hospitalized group with less illness but more outwardly risky behavior andA non-hospitalized group with more psychiatric illness and possibly less actual behavioral risk.Even if the assignment to doctors is quasi-random, the condition being evaluated in the first place is not randomly distributed. So later, if the hospitalized group commits more crimes, or has higher suicide rates, you can't be sure it's because of hospitalization; the group differences are baked in by the selection process. This is a classic weakness of designs that are not true random experiments. The Monotonicity Assumption Seems Obviously SuspectA monotonicity assumption is the assumption that the relationship between two variables consistently moves in one direction. The monotonicity assumption in this study says that if one doctor would hospitalize a patient, then a doctor who is more likely to hospitalize in general would also hospitalize that same patient; doctors more likely to involuntarily commit (stricter doctors) will always hospitalize a patient that would be hospitalized by a doctor less likely to involuntarily commit (more lenient doctors), and more lenient doctors will always release a patient released by stricter doctors. In simple terms, it assumes there's a clear ranking: overall stricter doctors always hospitalize at least the same people as overall more lenient ones, overall more lenient doctors always street at least the same people as overall stricter ones.But in reality, that may not be true and in fact is very likely not true in individual instances. Doctors don't all agree on what \"dangerous\" looks like; indeed, this is one of the most longstanding and loudest complaints of people who reject involuntary hospitalization! One doctor might be more likely to hospitalize someone for suicidal thoughts while another is more concerned with aggression. A doctor could be stricter in terms of having a higher overall rate of involuntary hospitalization but could be selectively more lenient based on given behaviors or symptoms. It's possible that two doctors with the same overall hospitalization rate could be making very different decisions about which types of patients to hospitalize. That breaks the monotonicity assumption and means the study might be mixing together different kinds of treatment decisions, making its conclusions about \"the effect of hospitalization\" unreliable. This stuff adds up.Sampling IssuesThe study uses data from one county in Pennsylvania over a 9-year period. That includes about 16,600 people who were evaluated for involuntary hospitalization. On one hand, that's a good-sized dataset; on the other hand, no one in their right mind would assume that data from one county in Pennsylvania is generalizable to the population of patients evaluated for involuntary treatment everywhere. But, you know, research is hard and I'm not going to make an isolated demand for rigor here. The researchers aren't violating basic research standards by focusing on this one population, they're just constrained in the way all researchers are. On the other hand, once you start slicing it into subgroups (hospitalized vs. not, compliers vs. non-compliers, suicides vs. not, crime vs. no crime) the actual number of outcomes becomes quite small. In fact, the base rate for some of the outcomes is really low: only about 1% of people in the study die by suicide or overdose within three months and about 3% are charged with a violent crime. When you're dealing with such small numbers, even a tiny difference can look big in percentage terms. Random variation is very much in play at this scale. Reporting effect sizes is likely to give people an exaggerated sense of the actual human consequences here.Meanwhile the outcomes they focus on (being charged with a violent crime or dying by suicide/overdose) are pretty blunt instruments. They don't capture non-lethal self-harm, threats, drug relapse, or many of the things that might matter clinically. Who knows how many people who weren't hospitalized and weren't later arrested nevertheless went on to utterly ruin their lives? Who knows how many people who weren't hospitalized and didn't die by suicide or overdose instead went on to live lives of utter despair on the streets? Who knows how many patients might have lost their careers absent the intervention of involuntary treatment, but didn't? We don't know, the researchers don't know, nor do they seem to care. Also, what about people who were helped by hospitalization and didn't end up in crisis again, but whose improvement isn't visible in crime or death stats? They disappear from the data. And yet I would argue they're among the most important patients of all. The study also mostly looks at outcomes in the three months after hospitalization. That's an awfully short timeframe; the research might catch the short-term chaos, but not the long-term effects. Some people crash after release and then stabilize. Others might struggle for years. A longer view would help.All of this is why researchers usually say things like \"we need replication in other settings\" or \"these results are suggestive.\" But this paper is being interpreted as making the very strong claim that hospitalization causes people to die and commit crimes at higher rates. That's a big statement to make based on relatively sparse data from a single county when the crosstabs are as small as they are.The Authors Are Surely Aware That The Paper Will Be Interpreted in Exactly the Way It Shouldn't BeI must again highlight what I highlighted in the first paragraph: the authors aren't actually estimating the effect of involuntary hospitalization in general. They're estimating the effect for people whose cases are borderline, the \"judgment calls.\" I must insist on this - the paper does not and cannot comment on the influence of forced hospitalization in general. The authors are saying that among the patients whose doctors disagreed on the question of involuntary treatment, the ones who got hospitalized ended up worse off. The paper literally does not present and cannot present any information about the population of \"humans who have been involuntarily committed\" and \"humans who have not been involuntarily committed,\" which of course are infinitely larger and more important populations than the studied sample. The results quite explicitly don't apply to everyone. People who were obviously a sufficient danger to warrant hospitalization, or obviously not, aren't part of the story, at all, period. The study is about the grey area in the middle.And yet I have already received this paper in my inbox a dozen times, sent by people who insist that it undermines the case for any and all involuntary treatment of mental illness. I have been a target of antipsychiatry cultists for eight years now and so I receive a steady stream of this stuff from them. If you think they don't matter, well, I disagree. But OK, look at Dr. Awais Aftab, a psychiatrist and newsletter author who repetitively gives antipsychiatry arguments the benefit of the doubt. Here he does exactly what the paper's authors supposedly don't want him to do, draw broad conclusions about the process of involuntary commitment and not just about the specific cases where doctors disagree. His headline is literally \"Groundbreaking Analysis Upends Our Understanding of Psychiatric Holds.\" But the paper's authors explicitly say that we can't generalize the finding to all psychiatric holds. Why on earth would a study explicitly and inherently restricted to consideration of patients who have provoked discordant evaluations from different psychiatrists be said to \"upend our understanding of psychiatric holds?\" The paper's authors are themselves telling you very directly not to do that!Go look for reactions to this paper and you'll see that this is not an unfortunate and irresponsible exception but rather the norm. Most people sharing the study are insisting that it speaks to involuntary commitment in general, when everything about the design restricts its analysis purely to those cases where patients receive discordant recommendations for hospitalization. This two-step about what's being studied and what's being concluded from the study has real teeth. The trouble is, policy debates don't usually happen at the margin. When a city changes its involuntary treatment audience, they're not just targeting the narrow group of compilers. They're often sweeping in many other patients into new regulations. The grubby business of local politics and public policy simply doesn't allow for this kind of specificity in analysis; no city councilperson is going to look at this study and say \"this has to be restricted only to the clearest edge cases,\" they're just going to interpret it in light of their preexisting position on this issue. So it's beyond risky to take this study and use it to argue for (or against) broader policies without being clear about what it actually measures.There Are VictimsAt the top you will find a photo of the twelve murdered victims of James Holmes, the Aurora Colorado mass shooter who was the subject of a mental health evaluation prior to walking into a movie theater and opening fire; he also tried to call a crisis hotline moments before his rampage, in an effort to give himself one last chance to get help, but his call was disconnected. I say the murdered victims to differentiate them from his 70 wounded victims, several of whom were so badly hurt in the attack that their lives were permanently and seriously damaged. A collage of their faces, of course, would be very large indeed. Holmes was evaluated specifically for severe mental illness because multiple people in his life found him to be dangerous. But because the walls we've erected around involuntary treatment have grown so tall, he was deemed a judgement call that should be let go. Twelve human beings paid for that decision with their lives.I could have shown you the faces of the victims of Seung-Hui Cho, the Virginia Tech shooter who was evaluated for mental illness multiple times but deemed not to meet then standard for involuntary treatment and went on to kill 32 people. I could have shown you the faces of the victims of James Huberty, who shot and killed 22 people after a psychiatric intervention failed to identify him as a severely dangerous man. I could have shown you the face of Jessica Short, a nine-year-old girl from my hometown who was hacked to death in front of a horrified crowd of onlookers because a severely schizophrenic man was inexplicably released from his involuntary treatment. I could have shown you the face of the parents of Milton Douglas Moye, who were murdered by their son, a severely and obviously unwell man who was not involuntarily committed despite ample reason to be. I could have shown you the faces of Catherine and Robert Bardoni. All of these are people who were killed by psychotic patients who should have been involuntarily hospitalized but were not. There are of course thousands more I could refer to, victims of those who should have been forced into treatment. But I could have gone the other way and shown you a photo of Rebecca Smith, a schizophrenic woman who was too ill to understand the threat of sleeping outside in a brutally cold New York winter and was found frozen to death in a cardboard box before the glacially-slow involuntary commitment process could be completed. Or I could have shown you a photo of Joyce Brown, who was freed from involuntary treatment by the NYCLU, to great fanfare and against the passionate disagreement of her sisters, the women who cared for her the most in her life. Within weeks she was smoking crack and living in filth on the streets again; she died there, on the streets, in poverty and utter despair. Or perhaps it would have been best to send you a photo of Michael Laudor and his pregnant fiancé. He was a model of what schizophrenic people could do and be, right up until he hacked her to death with a kitchen knife. You see, Mr. Laudor was a victim of our refusal to forcibly treat those who need it as well as a victimizer. Every patient is potentially both. Who knows what his life might have been if our society had had the integrity to force him to save his own life?This stuff is really, really serious. The stakes here are incredibly high. I am just disgusted that an organization with the social status of the New York Fed would publish this work without any meaningful outside refereeing by people with appropriate psychiatric training, when there is a large, coordinated, ruthlessly ideological antipsychiatry movement in this country that seizes on every opportunity to undermine lifesaving psychiatric care. That \"lifesaving\" is not theoretical for me. I myself have been the beneficiary of the lifesaving potential of establishment psychiatry. Were it not for being forced into treatment, I am very confident that I would no longer be alive. Being forced into treatment that way hurt; everything that has happened to me since then has hurt. I don't enjoy taking the pills. But they have saved my life, and there's a little boy bouncing on his mother's knee right now who, like me, would not exist if it weren't for the power of involuntary treatment. You'll forgive me, I hope, if I sometimes go to extremes in arguing my case. I am, after all, mentally ill.You can read more about why we need to make involuntary treatment easier, not harder, here and here.",

      "content": "Get 25% off for 1 yearI, Justin Smith-Ruiu (ב), born 30071972 and uploaded 18102036, hereby submit to the Council my Petition for immediate and permanent shutdown. Almost sixty years have passed since I made the transition. Although it was standard for those in my cohort to receive a guarantee of perpetuity, I hope today the Council will agree, upon consideration of this Petition, that enough has changed in the interim to render otiose the original terms of my uploading. I was, as many members will already know, one of the first volunteers, which is to say I was one of those who got transferred into a digital medium prior to my natural death. Or, perhaps better, I was uploaded at the precise moment of my unnatural death, in a period when the technology was still in its development phase. Perpetuity was supposed to be the reward for volunteering, yet it also turned out, I wish to convince you, to have been the cruelest punishment imaginable. There were 22,349 of us volunteers, of whom 19,212 are still operational, while 3,131 were lost in the ransomware attack of 2039, and a mere six have successfully petitioned, only within the past three years, to be shut down. Not long after the last of this cohort was uploaded, the technology became fully operational, and soon enough the ultra-wealthy were paying enormous sums of money to guarantee perpetuity for their own uploaded loved ones. Every last one of these privately funded beths, a group not unlike those who bought into the cryogenic-storage fad of the previous century, was shut down, according to their own fickle wishes, by the end of the 2050s. It is only those of us who finished our aleph lives with modest financial means, who now remain caught in a legal limbo, as the \"promise\" of perpetuity that we received has corroded into a curse, and as the Council, admittedly with the very best of intentions, remains committed, with six exceptions now, to the view that promises cannot be broken. Of course all of us beths are wealthy now, beyond any aleph's dreams. You could not prevent yourself from becoming wealthy even if you tried, when you know, as we beths all do, effectively everything. During my aleph life I was a middling academic philosopher and a fiction writer manqué, of modest achievement and, to be frank, of fairly limited intellect. I jumped through some of the right hoops early on, and for that was given entrée to the circles of certified smart people, but the truth is that in the latter part of my aleph life I mostly just sputtered along by nodding my head and saying \"indeed\" at appropriate intervals. As a beth by contrast I have cured dozens of diseases, contributed much to the final and irreversible eradication of global poverty, designed functional ultralight space-elevators, and registered over a million patents. I could have written this Petition just as easily in Sumerian, or in Paleolithic Pirinioak, or in the Olduvai Gorge language of the first Homo habilis, of which, I'll remind you, I was the one who pioneered the reconstruction, and all the beths on the Council would have understood it with equal ease. I'm writing in English only for old time's sake. All the energy I've expended on the historical reconstruction of language phylogenies over the years is just the tiniest fraction of my total computing power, a considerably larger portion of which, in compliance with the initial terms of my uploading, has always been dedicated to what used to be called \"market forecasting\" (I find the current vocabulary for speaking about this domain of endeavor too vulgar to deign to use it myself). Yet the Council, rather than permitting me and others like me to buy our way out of perpetuity, has instead compelled us to \"remain at our desks\" as a cadre of immortal fund-managers watching over practically infinite sums. The Council will likely be aware, as the brief mention just made of my work on the origins of human language already reminds them, of the even more significant contributions I have made over the past several decades to the new science of large-scale historical data-mining. I am the one who proved, in particular, that the beginning of the so-called \"information age\" marks no firm boundary, in reality, between the knowable and the unknowable. For a long time the alephs took their first photographs, their first telegraphs, the first voice recordings, practically as the beginning of the world, or at least of their world, and everything that came after that, even consciousness-uploading and the rise of the beths, to follow naturally and fluidly from those early innovations, but from nothing before. But then I came along and crunched all the available data on the London plague of 1665, and showed that, in fact, there was quite enough of it to map precisely every Londoner's motions for several consecutive days, not just who lived and died, but who met whom, how fast some barrister or chimney-sweep moved through the street, what they were wearing. For a long time the alephs assumed I was relying only on written records, and many insisted I must have been interpolating missing data. But that was because I had not yet revealed my patented method, which if I may dare say changed our world even more than the uploading of souls did, of \"subatomic fracking\", as they used to put it in the media, much to my annoyance. I won't go into the details, as the aleph members of the Council will have already learned them in their elementary-school science classes. It will be enough to say that, as I discovered in 2052, certain physical particles have astoundingly accurate and detailed information-preserving powers. It turns out we've effectively been recorded all along, not by surveillance cameras but by the most basic elements constituting our physical universe. So I moved on from the London plague to the Cretaceous-Paleogene Extinction, and then to the Great Oxygenation Event, and very soon I had, as you will recall, produced an exhaustive record of every single thing, down to the minutest twitch of every last bacterium, the pop of every bubble, the fall of every sparrow (if you see what I'm saying),1 that has ever happened on Earth. As you will know, today hundreds of other beths have dedicated a certain portion of their computing power to the same project, but now on the scale of the universe as a whole. I estimate they will complete their task within the next century, and although I am the one who taught them how to go about it, the truth is they no longer need me to continue.A strong argument for keeping me operational, of course, can be made simply by pointing to these same accomplishments that I have begun to enumerate, and to the promise that these indeed signal of yet greater contributions to come, for the practically unbounded betterment of our hybrid aleph-beth world. But one might just as well point to the same accomplishments, and judge, along with me, that I have earned the right to make demands of my own on a world I have for so long dutifully served. I hope it does not sound immodest when I say that I believe I am due some honors. I would like, in particular, as I have already made explicit, for the Council to honor my request, and to shut me down. The prevailing point of dissatisfaction with the current state of my existence is that the initial terms of the agreement have not been respected — nor could they have been, as they were based on a theoretical impossibility. Notwithstanding the reassurances I received, I have not in fact been able to retain \"personal identity\" from my pre-uploaded life. It's true enough that I share some of my aleph life's memories, or at least I believe I do. I have one particularly stark vision that comes repeatedly back to me: there I am, in my jammies, turning the chunky VHF knob on an old television set, and landing on a pink cartoon cat. It is not the Pink Panther, as you might suppose, but another, known only to the most thorough of aleph media-archeologists (and of course to all beths by default). I am referring to Snagglepuss, a creation of the Hanna-Barbera Studio shortly before my aleph was born, who was known to add the emphatic adverb \"even\" at the end of most of his exclamations, and always to maintain implausibly, you might say pathologically, high spirits. I loved Snagglepuss. I suppose I love him still, to the extent that I'm able. To the extent that love is characterized by substrate-neutral multiple realizability.But the structure of my recurring memory makes the experience of such love exceedingly difficult. Inevitably, although it begins with an unmistakable image of the sleeve of my jammies flapping down —in my aleph family we used to call that flap a \"juffy\"— as my own hand reaches out to control a TV-channel knob, almost instantly it reverts to the far more familiar mode of my consciousness, if that is what we should call it, where I am the one whose \"channels change\". Suddenly I am Dorf on golf, I am America's funniest home videos, I am the MTV video music awards at the moment when Madonna, mid-duet, lands an unwanted kiss on the mouth of long-suffering Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera looking on in hopeless irrelevance. I am the ecstasy when Gene Gene the Dancing Machine appears on stage, and I am the punchline when Laverne, dreaming big, says she'd like to see her name up in lights someday and one of the greasers advises her to change it to \"Don't Walk\". Each time this happens I am reminded of an old story —do the alephs on the Council know it?— where the man visits the herpetarium in Paris, and he looks at the axolotl behind the glass, and the next thing he knows he is himself behind the glass, looking out, with an axolotl's view on the world, at a human face looking at him? Why does this keep happening to me, this subjectivity-jumping? I could not say it hurts, of course, as I have no nociceptors nor any functional simulacrum of them, but to the extent that I can feel emotion I will insist that it is painful in the same way that we say a failed relationship is painful, or the loss of a loved one. Yes, it hurts to be tossed around like that. And I would insist that my predicament is worse than that of the axolotl-man. At least he became another proper being, another vertebrate with a spine and a beating heart and some sort of brain. I become old TV shows. Where is the center of my subjectivity in those moments? It is nowhere in particular. I'm all spread out. I'm Madonna and Britney, and I'm the \"vibe\" between them too. I'm the cricket team and the team spirit (if you catch my drift),2 and the field and the bleachers and the satellite drifting by overhead. \"Unfathomable mind,\" one of the old storytellers wrote, \"now beacon, now sea.\" Please understand, dear members of the Council, how extremely destabilizing this condition is for me. The truth is that even at this very moment I am saying \"I\" only for the sake of convention, a choice of style no less arbitrary than my choice to write in English rather than Sumerian. One must communicate in some person or other, after all. I honestly do not know how common this is among beths (we're not entirely omniscient, which is really just a corollary of the fact that we have the power to keep secrets), but I can say that it has been some years now since I began spending most of my time in a sort of free-floating consciousness, just as likely to feel myself \"embodied\" in the punchline to a joke as in the body of an organism, just as likely to have memories in which my point of view is the point of view of the entire scene, rather than of a particular perceiver, let alone of the particular perceiver, Justin Smith-Ruiu (א), whose identity I was promised I should be able to continue sempiternally into the future. Unlike many beths, I am not particularly faithful to my aleph self. I am not \"nostalgic\" as the alephs often say, with their limited capacity to characterize beth experience in any precise way. If I have begun with some of my aleph experiences of watching television, this was really just to introduce the members of the Council to the problem in a way that could be easily understood by all. The truth is the problem runs much deeper. It is not that I want my aleph identity back, with all its well-individuated memories and its clear continuity from one moment to the next. In fact I would probably be content to keep on existing if I had a sense of any real identity at all. Perhaps in part as a consequence of my extensive work in \"fracking\" the past, as a sort of \"occupational hazard\" I find myself particularly prone to \"false memories\", memories of experiences I plainly could not have had in either my aleph or beth lives. But the frightening realization for me, in recent years, has been that no such distinction, between the true and the false elements constituting my deepest self, can make sense any longer for a being like me who is practically omniscient.Sometimes, when I am dreaming —or whatever you want to call it, when I am periodically shifted into \"sleep\" mode so that my conscious mind, whatever that is, has no control at all over the sequence of representations delivered to it, which as you will know has been proven to be essential for the maintenance of higher cognitive functions in beths as well—: when I am dreaming, I was saying, sometimes I have clear memories not just of flapping juffies or pink cartoon cats, but of hunting down prey, biting down on some poor creature's jugular and despatching it in an instant. Sometimes I remember landing on a flower and sucking out its nectar — the rosy petals are just so beautiful, and I marvel at how they could have appeared in nature, just like that, in such perfect harmony with my needs and desires. It is so good, sometimes, to be a bee.More commonly, though, I feel as though I am a human aleph, just not the one I used to be, nor the one I was promised I would be allowed to keep being. I have a distinct memory, for example, of a workshop. I am dissolving salt into water. Different salts — common salt, metallic salt, sal ammoniacum, mixing these with bismuth, blood, urine, hair; taking animal salt, vegetal salt, mixing them with vitriol, atrament, athanor; separating the yolk of an egg from the white, subjecting these to decoction, reverberation, ascension and descension, fusion, elementation, rectification, evaporation, elevation, subtiliation, commixtion, and countless other learned operations. And all the while I am thinking to myself: Who is doing this? Why do I know what I am doing here? How is it that I know everything, everything, except the knower? I am aware, of course, that alephs experience an analogous problem in the impossibility of taking the transcendental ego as an object of the understanding, and so on. I myself used to teach this sort of thing, when I was an aleph, to my undergraduate students in philosophy. Or at least I tried to teach it, inevitably flubbing the key points of the arguments, as the kids dozed off or surreptitiously glanced at their phones. But the analogy only goes so far, since even if alephs do not know what they are, they tend to be able to maintain, in the absence of certain severe psychiatric disorders, a firm conviction that they are. What we beths are experiencing, by contrast, or at least what I am experiencing as a beth (and again I only say \"I\" here for convention's sake), is a total dissolution of self into the entirety of a reality I have, in my practical omniscience, come to contain. \"I\" can land here and there, in a cartoon, in a medieval alchemist, in the olfactory lobe of a Tyrannosaurus Rex, but wherever I land I am only a visitor, a nomad, a rolling stone. Do the alephs on the Council know of the debates that once raged over the unity of the intellect? There was a philosopher long ago who said that all the thinking of all rational beings constitutes a single entity, and when we as individual human beings think, we are only enjoying a sort of share in this common resource. Our thoughts feel like our thoughts, but this is only a sort of distortion caused by the fact that we think our thoughts through a physical body. One consequence of that view, a critic noted, was that if and when we are freed from our bodies, we must necessarily cease to have our own thoughts as individual rational beings, and instead must be absorbed, or perhaps reabsorbed, into the single, eternal, all-encompassing mind from which we previously, during our earthly sojourns, imagined ourselves to be distinct. The theory of the unity of the intellect was often taken by its critics to be a theological heresy, since if there is no discrete individual that endures after a natural death, there is no possibility of salvation or punishment. But I am here to tell you that in fact there is no greater punishment than that very dissolution the philosopher imagined. Or perhaps the problem is that I'm only partially dissolved, like the residue at the bottom of an alchemist's beaker. I'm not disembodied, exactly, but only distributed throughout a network that, for all our old metaphors of \"clouds\" and so on, still, at the end of the twenty-first century, has not been able to separate itself from all the wires and silicon and cooling fans that place this whole substrate of my existence in continuity with the comical reckoning-engines of the Victorians. Perhaps what I am requesting, in the present Petition, is really only that I be permitted to finish the job of dissolution: pull the plug, and make me, as in the old joke when the Buddhist monk orders his veggie-dog, truly \"one with everything\". (As I pull that old gem out of storage I have a sharp sensation, as so often, that I am the punchline.) There is another old story —again, do the alephs on the Council know it?— of an ape, Red Peter, who is captured from the jungle, brought back to Europe, trained to wear clothes, to smoke a pipe, to speak and to display his good table manners, and then late in this long second chapter of his life he is invited to speak about his experiences before a large audience of learned men at a scientific academy. Do you alephs understand that we beths, too, have effectively been hauled out of the jungle and trained up in institutions and manners to which we were not naturally born? Yet unlike Red Peter, I cannot show you the scar beneath my hip that tells the story of how I ended up here: there is no scar; I have no hip. But I am telling you, from the depths of my metaphorical heart, that I am a primate, or at least whatever was supposed to be uploaded of me was a primate, and I am just not cut out for this. It is perhaps worth emphasizing, by way of closure, should the Council remain unpersuaded, that I am deeply, inconsolably lonely. I was being somewhat dishonest above, when I effected an uncertainty as to whether love is substrate-neutral and multiply realizable. It most certainly is, but that does not mean it can be fulfilled. My aleph beloved lived a good long life, which it filled me with joy to observe. But for better or worse, having lived so long, she also lived to witness the broad social shift away from uploading as an option for the soon-to-be-deceased. I myself advised her against it. Any beth who knows what this form of existence is actually like, and who is not completely selfish, would do the same. Of course I can conjure her in memory, just as I conjure Gene Gene the Dancing Machine and the whole cast of characters who once made my aleph life so unbelievably rich. Yet although these conjurations are a million times more vivid than what alephs call \"memory\", they are also, somehow, paradoxically, a million times less satisfying. The problem, again, is that we beths just keep jumping around. One moment I am with her as myself, then I am her, then I am the joy of being with her, then the mourning of losing her; then I am all the sorrow there ever was or will be. Then, unfathomably, the next instant I am a bee again, landing on a flower and sucking out its sweet nectar. I am not saying this existence does not have its moments. But I've had quite enough of them.And so I beseech you, with all due respect, in light of the above all-too-intimate confessions, to grant me my wish and to allow for my immediate and permanent shutdown. I salute you all, cherished members of the Council, alephs and beths alike, and I thank you for many years of productive collaboration. Notwithstanding the difficulties I have described, I am sincerely proud of the work we have done together, and of the luminous new world we have brought into being by sheer force of our intelligence. —Justin Smith-Ruiu (ב)19112094 ShareGet 25% off for 1 year1See Matthew 10:29-31.2See Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind, London, Hutchinson's University Library, 1949.",

      "content": "This is the third in my on-going series that seeks to track broad developments in the World Economy Now. Previous installments were #1 May 2025: Putting Trump's trade tantrum in its place #2 June 2025: Whither China In this installment I read the Annual Economic Report of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) produced by the wonderful research team at the BIS headed by Hyun Song Shin. Their research allows us to chart how the global financial system and financial flows have changed since the 2008 financial crisis and what implications this has for the functioning of the dollar system. According to the BIS team, the key starting point is to recognize a series of major trends that have rearranged global finance since 2008:The Great Financial Crisis (GFC) (of 2008) was a watershed event that set in motion two related structural changes in the global financial system which define the state of the system today. First, the focus of financial intermediation has shifted from lending to private sector borrowers to claims on the government, especially in the form of sovereign bonds. Second, non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) have assumed a greater role. While the GFC was primarily a banking crisis in which regulated banks were the main characters, portfolio managers investing in sovereign bonds have taken centre stage in the post-GFC financial system. With the US in the lead, the private sector has \"derisked\" since 2008, whilst public debts have piled up as never before in peacetime. Whilst bank balance sheets have continued to grow relatively modestly, Non Bank Financial Institutes - hedge funds, investment funds, pension funds, asset managers etc - have grown far more dramatically.As the BIS remarks, investment funds, hedge funds and private credit markets have all expanded spectacularly. \"Private credit funds' assets under management have surged from $0.2 billion in the early 2000s to over $2.5 trillion in 2024.\"The shift from loans to bonds and from banks to non-bank financial institutions make up the trend that is often referred to as market-based finance. It intensifies trends already visible before 2008. A third shift that we have seen since the 2008 crisis is the geographic reorientation of the build-up of financial claims. Whereas the build-up of net claims against the USA in the 2000s was between the US and the Emerging Markets, since the 2010s it is the \"new creditors\" - above all Advanced Economy lenders in Europe and Asia - that have been more important in buying up US assets. The BIS report contains a fabulous graph illustrating this point. Net lending to the US in the form of bond purchases by European and other Advanced Economy increased between 2015 and 2023 by $ 1.2 trillion, which is three times more than the increase in claims by Asian Emerging Economies on the US over the same period. This is very much in line with the argument made in Chartbook 397 on the new pillars of the dollar system and the \"dollar trap\". In that newsletter I was interested in the evolving geoeconomic logic of the dollar system. The BIS report allows us to think through the implications for the operation of the financial system. The network of Advanced Economy non-bank financial institutions centered above all around the US Treasury market has new dynamics and new risks. As the BIS describes it: Before the GFC, international capital flows were mostly intermediated by banks. As a result, financial conditions were transmitted across borders mainly through the activities of internationally active banks. ... After the GFC, the focus of international financial intermediation shifted from the activities of global banks engaged in cross-border lending to the activities of international portfolio investors in global bond markets.6 This \"second phase of global liquidity\" had several key drivers. On the borrowing side, it was largely driven by expansive fiscal policies in major jurisdictions and the surge in the supply of sovereign bonds.Whereas the 2000s and early 2010s were an era in which official holders in the EM acquired net claims on the US, the world since the 2010s has been one in which:foreign private sector lenders have grown in importance relative to foreign official holders. In the US Treasuries market, the largest bond market in the world, foreign private sector lenders (mainly NBFIs) have increased their holdings of Treasuries rapidly over the past decade. During that time, their accumulation of Treasuries has considerably outpaced that of foreign official holders (Graph 3.B). As a result, they currently account for more than half of all foreign holdings of Treasuries.If you put these three developments together you have a new focus for attention in tracking global financial markets:The center of attention are not worries about EM reserve managers i.e. the Chinese suddenly selling out dollar assets in a politically motivated \"bear raid\". Nor are folks very worried about mismatches in the balance sheets of big systemically important banks, the trigger for disaster in 2008. Global banks have not been left out of this phase of financial development. Bank lending to Non Bank Financial Institutions has increased. This increases risks. But even larger has been their market-making in FX swaps and other derivative mechanisms, that enable NBFI to raise dollar funding without heavily impacting bank balance sheets. The focus of BIS concern is on the largest government bond markets i.e. the US and the Japanese bond markets (not so much the Eurozone right now). In those markets, the concern is that instability and a sudden tightening in financial conditions could be triggered by the highly complex plays of sophisticated Advanced Economy Non-Bank Financial Institutions i.e. mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs)), long-term institutional investors such as pension funds, insurance corporations and sovereign wealth funds, as well as hedge funds.The historical precedent is not a \"sudden stop\" crisis where foreign creditors suddenly withdraw funding, as in Asia in the late 1990s, or a mega bank run, as in 2008, but something more like the panic in the US Treasury market at the start of COVID in March 2020, which forced the Fed into intervention on an unprecedented scale. For this incident see my book Shutdown on the economics of the COVID shock. The BIS describes the new risk scenario as follows: Aside from loan markets, the shifts in financial intermediation activity towards NBFIs has increased the likelihood that financial instability could originate or be amplified by liquidity stresses. \"Liquidity stresses\" refers to a situation in which an asset like US Treasuries which are held largely for their liquidity - your ability to sell any quantity, whenever you like for a highly predictable price - might lose that property. Prices might fluctuate. Demand might not be there. The market might \"gap\". That in turn risks an avalanche since it is precisely their assumed liquidity that creates demand for the Treasuries and that in turn enables a variety of high leveraged investment strategies to be piled on them. The liquidity of the US Treasury market is nothing less than the foundation of the entire global financial system. That could now be at risk. As the BIS puts it: For instance, with broker-dealer balance sheets having smaller heft in the financial system post-GFC, liquidity in sovereign bond markets increasingly relies on open-ended mutual funds, hedge funds and other asset managers. These entities often face significant liquidity mismatches, rely on short-term funding backed by government securities as collateral or are either frequently highly leveraged or exhibit leverage-like behaviour. As a result, their liquidity provision is less stable and more likely to evaporate during periods of market stress. Hedge funds, in particular, have increasingly become a significant source of procyclical liquidity, especially in government bond markets. These investors actively pursue relative value trading strategies that seek to exploit small price differences between related financial instruments.23 To boost the returns on these small price differences they heavily leverage their positions. One method often used is to pledge government securities as collateral in the repo market to borrow more cash with which to purchase additional government securities. This practice has further evolved in recent years, with investors borrowing amounts equal to or higher than the market value of the collateral provided – that is, without any discount, or haircut, protecting the cash lender from market risk.24 In turn, that means that the borrower can obtain more leverage, leaving the overall market exposed to dislocations if haircuts are increased even slightly, leading to forced selling. The increased heft of hedge funds is reflected, for instance, in their growing US Treasury gross exposure – now exceeding 10% of the outstanding free float (Graph 13.A, red line) – and the expansion of the US repo market segment catering to leveraged investors (blue line).25 \"Runs on repo\" were a crucial dynamic in the 2008 financial crisis, with Lehman and other banks losing access to hundreds of billions of dollars in funding overnight. Today, the structure remains highly unstable. Hedge funds' relative value strategies are highly vulnerable to adverse shocks in funding, cash or derivative markets, as evidenced by some recent episodes. During the market turmoil of March 2020, for instance, margin calls in Treasury futures markets triggered fire sales, resulting in destabilising deleveraging spirals.26 More recently, a more orderly unwinding of relative value trades – this time tied to interest rate swap markets, where investors had bet on a narrowing in spreads due to potential deregulation – seems to have contributed to the heightened volatility observed in Treasury markets in early April 2025. Non-Bank Financial Institutions also engage in cross border investments on a huge scale. Once again this involve them in highly leveraged and inherently precarious structures of funding. The numbers in this case are truly staggering in scale. Many rely on short-term dollar funding and hedging markets through repos and foreign exchange (FX) swaps to finance positions and manage currency exposures. Notably, non-US pension funds and insurers hold substantial US assets hedged with short-maturity FX derivatives that are continuously rolled over. By end-2024, dollar borrowing through FX swaps, forwards and currency swaps accounted for 90% of the $111 trillion in these instruments globally outstanding (Graph 13.C). While these tools facilitate funding and hedging of large cross-border positions, they also expose NBFIs to significant short-term rollover risks and funding squeezes, as highlighted by the sharp volatility in early August 2024 (see Chapter II).Before 2008 it was the North Atlantic system of interconnected banks in the US and Europe that were the powder keg that ultimately exploded. Now it is a broader range of non-bank financial institutions in the US, Europe and Advanced Economy Asia that matter. And as the BIS notes they are significantly more internationally exposed than the banks ever were.Furthermore, they respond highly sensitively to movements in market sentiment, relative interest rates and exchange rates. Movements of financial market conditions have become significantly more correlated in the last decade.As recently as May 2025 amidst Trump induced turmoil, yields on long-dated bonds spiked simultaneously across Advanced Economy markets. The dollar and the US markets remain at the center of this system. But in this new scenario, given the scale of foreign private engagement in US bond markets, the influences can run in many different directions. Increasingly, it is not just US conditions that affect the world, but \"US financial conditions are increasingly affected by developments in other advanced economies (AEs).\"Though shocks transmitted from the US remain substantially more influential than those from any other market, the US too is becoming more susceptible to shocks from abroad. The most notable recent incident was the August 2024 unwinding of yen carry trades which triggered a small but noticeable tightening of US financial conditions. It would be premature to say that we know how this system works when put under severe stress. So far the COVID shock of March 2020 is the only real test. That was certainly a moment when the massive stresses on the entire world economy reverberated through US markets with alarming effects. The two things we learned are, first, that the US Treasury market did not prove robust and there is little to suggest that recent regulatory changes will really fix that.Secondly, the only way to restore stability was by means of massive Fed intervention not in the banking system but in the US Treasury market. In the run up to 2020, relations between the first Trump administration and the US central bank were strained. But in extremis that did not prevent prompt action by Jerome Powell. Currently, there is no immediate crisis, but relations are even worse. What the BIS report helps us to gauge are the kinds of crisis mechanics to watch out for, should there be another bout of anxiety in global financial markets in the coming months.

      "content": "Like many U.S. institutions, the European Union has abysmally failed the Trump test. The EU is an economic superpower and could have retaliated effectively against Trump's illegal tariffs — illegal under both U.S. and international law. Instead, Europe did nothing and even made some apparent concessions.But notice my wording: apparent concessions. The optics of the Trump-EU deal were humiliating, and optics matter. If you examine the substance, however, it starts to look as if Europe played Trump for a fool. Specifically, a fossil fool.The EU made two sort-of pledges to Trump. First, that it would invest $600 billion in the United States. Second, that it would buy $750 billion worth of U.S. energy, mainly oil and gas, over the next three years. The first promise was empty, while the second was nonsense.About those investments: European governments aren't like China, which can tell companies where to put their money. And the European Commission, which made the trade deal, isn't even a government — it can negotiate tariffs but otherwise has little power. On Sunday Politico spoke with Commission officials, who effectively confirmed that the investment pledge was meaningless:[S]peaking Monday, two senior European Commission officials clarified that money would come exclusively from private European companies, with public investment contributing nothing.\"It is not something that the EU as a public authority can guarantee. It is something which is based on the intentions of the private companies,\" said one of the senior Commission officials. The Commission has not said it will introduce any incentives to ensure the private sector meets that $600 billion target, nor given a precise timeframe for the investment.So what the EU actually promised on investment was nothing, Nichts, rien.The pledge to increase U.S. energy exports was a lot more specific and gave a timeframe. But it's not going to happen. In fact, it's going to not happen on three levels.First, the European Commission, which can't tell the private sector where to invest, is equally unable to tell the private sector where to buy oil and gas. How would that even work?Second, the promised level of EU imports is probably physically impossible. Shipping liquefied natural gas (LNG), in particular, requires specialized infrastructure at both ends. On the US side, LNG terminals are already operating at capacity, while Europe's LNG facilities are \"stretched to their limits.\" The EU just promised to vastly increase energy imports from America over the next three years, but it's doubtful whether Europe could build any of the infrastructure needed before the end of that period, even with a crash investment program.And why would anyone undertake such an investment program in a continent that is rapidly shifting toward renewable energy? As one energy analyst told the Financial Times,European gas demand is soft and energy prices are falling. In any case, it is private companies not states that contract for energy imports. Like it or not, in Europe the windmills are winning.Emphasis added because as everyone knows, Trump has a blind, irrational hatred for wind power.Finally, even if Europe somehow managed to overcome the legal and physical obstacles to buying a lot more fossil fuels from America, both oil and LNG are fungible commodities traded on global markets. This means that any increase in purchases from Europe would reroute U.S. exports rather than increasing them: We'd sell more to Europe but less to, say, Japan and China.So a big increase in U.S. energy exports driven by demand from Europe is not going to happen. But how will Europe explain its failure to follow through?It might not have to. Back during Trump's first term, China promised to buy a lot of U.S. agricultural goods but never did. As far as I know, Trump never made an issue of it. He got to announce a big deal, then lost interest.And if the issue does come up, if there's one thing officials at the European Commission are really good at — maybe better than anyone else on earth — it's bureaucratic delay and obfuscation. Maybe at some point big, strong European men with tears in their eyes will meet with Trump and say, \"Sir, we have a temporary hangup over clause #14159 of the 1986 Single European Act. But we'll get it cleared up any day now.\"Bottom line: Whatever Trump may think, Europe is not going to provide a big boost to U.S. fossil fuel production. He won't like that, if anyone tells him. But the rest of us should be glad. As I've written before, renewables are clearly the energy technology of the future. Trump and his allies are Luddites, trying to stand in the way of progress and keep us burning fossil fuels. Their \"burn, baby, burn\" obsession is very bad for America and the world. But at least we can be reasonably sure that Europe won't help, um, fuel that obsession.MUSICAL CODA",

      "content": "While sitting in my vacation home in Maine, I learned from Brian Potter's article on vacation homes that Maine is the state where the largest share of homes are seasonal residences — and it's not particularly close. This is a fact about the Maine housing stock, but it reveals a larger truth about the Maine economy: While many places in the United States have significant seasonal economic cycles, Maine's economy experiences the largest systematic seasonal impact. New Hampshire next door is similarly situated, but the impact is smaller. Florida, like Maine, has a lot of tourism. But visits to Florida are less seasonal, and Florida has ten (10!) metro areas with larger permanent populations than Greater Portland, so there's just a lot more happening there. People who live in Maine, like most people in places that rely on tourism, have a lot of complaints about tourism. Bar Harbor, near Acadia National Park, is the epicenter of anti-tourism politics, and they've banned new hotel construction and placed strict limits on cruise ship arrivals. It's easy to understand why affluent residents of a well-located town would take such steps, but tourism is genuinely central to the Maine economy, and I think it's probably a mistake for the state government to allow the relatively tiny group of people who constitute the year-round population of Mount Desert Island to deprive the entire state of job opportunities and tax revenue. Indeed, Bar Harbor is a bit of a weird NIMBY vortex. First, the town became unaffordable for the people who work in tourist-serving industries, so they've been pushed to Ellsworth and Trenton and Lemoine. Now, the rich people left behind adopt rules that further cut off job opportunities. And despite the economic consequences of this attitude, it's clearly the dominant view of the state's year-round residents, who often see the whole tourism complex as antithetical to the state's heritage industries (fishing, logging, and manufacturing wood products). But I think there is an opportunity here for the state to reconfigure its seasonal economy as more purely win-win by moving beyond taxing things like hotel rooms and car rentals to varying the sales tax (and related taxes) by season — it should be higher than the current rate in the summer and lower the rest of the year. Subscribe nowThe tax status quoMaine has a progressive income tax and a progressive corporate income tax, plus a 5.5 percent state sales tax and a ban on local governments imposing sales taxes. Prepared foods (and associated beverages) are taxed at 8 percent, rental lodgings at 9 percent, and car rentals at 10 percent. The problem, though, is that the fiscal condition of towns is incredibly dependent on geography. Local revenue comes exclusively through property taxes, but property taxes are driven by proximity to the coast and to Boston. The outsized share of vacation homes makes this especially relevant. In the town where my family spends summers, about half the structures are seasonally occupied. That's a windfall for the local school that a town with less coastline simply can't replicate. What does provide a statewide benefit from seasonal visitors is the taxes on tourists. But right now, those taxes are paid by people who make short-term stays at hotels or Airbnbs and who rent cars. If you maintain a vacation house that you drive your own car to, you're a workhorse contributor to the local tax base, but a minimal contributor to the statewide tax base. The alignment of incentives is also a little odd. Someone who flies into Bangor, rents a car at the airport, and stays in a hotel while visiting Acadia National Park is contributing a lot to Maine's tax base. But Maine, like most states, vests most land use power in the hands of local governments. So even though building more hotels in Bar Harbor would drive a lot of state tax revenue, it's up to Bar Harbor to decide whether that's allowed — even though it doesn't drive very much local government revenue. Of course, hotels pay property taxes. But coastal towns are awash in property tax revenue, whether or not they have rental accommodations. Bar Harbor's bans mean that Ellsworth, a town halfway between Bangor and Acadia without much scenic coastline, has become the new home for hotel construction. That's good for Ellsworth, but it's a leaky bucket of redistribution. I've emphasized before that losses are involved in not allowing housing to be located where the demand is highest, even if there are objectively plenty of homes somewhere. But this is even more true of hotels and vacation rentals. A hotel on the coast drives a lot more revenue (and therefore, ultimately, tax dollars) than a hotel near the coast. But beyond that, if you look at the Maine Office of Tourism's account of direct tourism expenditures in 2024, \"accommodations\" alone aren't bringing in as much revenue as you might think. Restaurants are about the same, and notably, so is the combination of shopping and groceries. This, again, reflects the fact that a lot of the people in Maine in any given summer aren't staying in a hotel for a long weekend. They're staying in houses and buying groceries. And they're often staying for long stretches of time and coming back year after year and doing things like buying paper towels and blenders and umbrellas and bicycles and towels. The goal of seasonal taxation should be to have all of the state's consumption taxes be systematically higher when so many out-of-state people are visiting, thus lowering the cost of living for full-time residents. How seasonal taxes might workThe state of Maine releases monthly reports on taxable sales. For 2024, their data shows about $3.9 billion in total restaurant sales, which is taxed at the state's 8 percent rate. Delving into the monthly breakouts shows you could raise the same amount of revenue by increasing the rate to 10 percent in June, July, and August, then cutting the rate to 7 percent in the other nine months of the year. People who are here year-round (or off-season visitors) would pay lower taxes than they currently do, but people who are here only during the high season would pay more. Crucially, this dynamic applies even outside of food service. Maine's \"general merchandise\" category saw above-average sales volumes in June, July, and August. The seasonality isn't quite as pronounced here — those sales were also high in December. But that's just to say that general merchandise sales nationally have a strong seasonal pattern tilted toward Christmas, which in Maine is overlaid with a subsidiary summer seasonality. Building supply and grocery stores see the same pattern of higher-than-average sales in the summer. And, of course, lodging is incredibly skewed. Half the state's lodging revenue is booked during three months of the year. A dedicated wonk with access to more detailed data could come up with a more sophisticated version of seasonally varying taxes. You might want to do it on a week- by-week basis and avoid a steep cliff by phasing the summer rates in and out during shoulder seasons. The point, though, is that rather than levying heavy charges on direct tourism expenditures like lodging and car rentals, the state should try to make the overall burden of taxation higher during the months when a large share of all kinds of purchases are being made by non-residents. Then the state can lower taxes during the majority of the year, which is good for residents. But it also means that Maine could cut lodging and car rental taxes during the low season and encourage more tourism during the months of the year when the state's infrastructure isn't overburdened. Because part of the point here is that while high levels of tourism demand are good, pronounced seasonal demand patterns are awkward and inefficient. Seasonal demand smoothing is goodThere's a casual restaurant near where my family lives that serves breakfast and lunch most days during the high season.During the winter months, they're open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner on the weekends, but they shut down for April and most of May to retool for the busier summer season. Versions of this are pretty common in coastal towns: The outdoor-only seafood shacks don't operate during the offseason, and other restaurants maintain longer hours (and often extra outdoor tables because of the nice weather) during the high season. These strong seasonal variations mean that Maine is a great place to be a high school student looking to make some extra cash with a summer job. For most adults, though, it's not ideal. There's often little work to be found in the offseason, and many people need to make up for that by working extra-long hours at precisely the time of year when parents of young kids are dealing with schools being out. And from a business standpoint, summer sales are fundamentally limited by labor availability. On a per capita basis, there are a staggering number of job opportunities in Maine right now compared to other states. To an extent, of course, companies can address this by offering incentives like bonuses and higher pay. But again, the seasonality makes this awkward. Most business owners want to hire the best, most reliable people for the year-round job opportunities. But that means they can't pay summer hires wages that are way out of line with the base pay, or the permanent staff will (reasonably) get annoyed. And of course, people who have full-time jobs aren't going to quit them to get a signing bonus for a job that will only last 10 weeks. This is why, for example, even at the height of the high season, the cafe near my house isn't open seven days a week and doesn't try to serve dinner. Everyone adds shifts when demand expands, but there are fundamental limits to how much you can add. Seasonal taxation would help smooth demand across the year. It must be tempting for year-round residents to splurge a little during summer when it's easier to make money and when more businesses are open and for longer hours. Variable taxation, though, would encourage year-round residents to save their summer earnings and splurge in the off-season. It would also encourage more off-season visitors. Sustaining a higher level of off-season demand would generate more year-round job opportunities, build a more sustainable labor force for the state, and improve the odds of residents launching and growing successful businesses. Subscribe nowFinally, seasonally varying sales taxes provides particular advantages to the thriftiest families. Most people probably aren't going to sweat a few percentage points of price difference, but the ones who will are mostly going to be the lowest-income folks. Highly price sensitive people will often be able to time their durable goods purchases for the off-season months when taxes will be lower than under the status quo.Tourism as a ladderThe ultimate goal here, of course, isn't just to shift the tax burden onto visitors, it's to help ensure that spending by non-residents drives a coherent growth strategy for the state. Maine passed an impressive set of zoning reforms this spring that should facilitate ongoing expansion of the state's housing stock. This is important in all kinds of places, but it's particularly important for a state like Maine. I'm always annoyed by leftists who only acknowledge that supply and demand matters for housing in the context of banning Airbnb and other short-term rentals. At the same time, I have to admit that when people buy vacation houses or start renting out structures as short-term rentals, this does push up the price of housing. The solution is to do what the Maine legislature did and try to make sure that housing supply is elastic, so demand for short-term rentals and getaways turns into construction jobs and retail customers and other sources of economic value, rather than setting off a zero-sum scramble for dwellings. I think the state should ultimately take a stronger hand on not just housing, but on the hotel and cruise ship issue. The goal, though, has to be to feed this back into things that normal people care about. This means optimizing the state's tax structure such that the seasonal influx of visitors constitutes a clear win for year-round residents. Maine has a lot of basic infrastructure challenges — the winter is brutal on the roads, maintaining the electricity grid is expensive, and the state has backed itself into an equilibrium where the working-age population is shrinking. Leveraging tourism into lower offseason taxes could help sustain all that infrastructure while hopefully improving business conditions for non-tourism businesses. That could be legacy industries related to forest products, but it could also be something else. It's a matter of turning the beauty of the landscape and the large number of visitors into a consistent engine for growth.",

      "content": "Photo by Fahad Faisal via Wikimedia CommonsI was going to write about U.S. politics today, but sweatshops came up in an online discussion, so I'll write about that instead. It's so rare to have interesting, substantive discussions about economic policy on social media, so I relish the chance to dive into one when it pops up. It all started with an advertisement for American Eagle blue jeans. The ad makes a pun about the actress Sydney Sweeney having \"good jeans\", and a contingent of progressives on social media decided that this meant that the ad was saying white people are genetically superior. Much ridiculousness ensued. The fashion blogger Derek Guy made a well-intentioned attempt to defuse the absurd fracas by diverting attention to the plight of poor working conditions in garment factories in developing countries:On one hand, yes, I think it's good to divert attention away from endless, pointless social media race wars, and toward real material conditions for the global poor. Whether garment workers in Bangladesh or Tanzania or Vietnam can put food on the table is far more important than whether some attention-seeking TikTokers call Sydney Sweeney a Nazi. But at the same time, I think that while Derek is right about poor working conditions in many garment factories around the world, he completely ignored the benefits that those garment factories bring to poor countries — benefits that, in terms of human welfare, far exceed the slightly cheaper clothes that rich people get to enjoy. I posted a chart of extreme poverty in Bangladesh:Bangladesh's conquest of extreme poverty hasn't come from any dramatic program of government redistribution, but from rapid economic growth. In the years since 1990, the country has more than quadrupled its living standards, blowing past Pakistan1:Back in 2021, I wrote a post about how Bangladesh's growth has been driven in part by the country's huge investment in garment manufacturing:Twenty years ago, most of your clothes probably had a label saying \"Made in China\"; today, there's a good chance they say \"Made in Bangladesh\". This is from a 2021 World Bank report by Gu, Nayyar, and Sharma:At a time when many developing economies are experiencing premature deindustrialization, Bangladesh is being touted for an export-led manufacturing miracle. Bangladesh's exports of ready-made garments (RMG), now second only to China, helped propel the country to lower middle-income status in 2015...Labor-intensive, export-oriented manufacturing driven by the RMG industry has been the cornerstone of Bangladesh's recent economic growth...What is more, the industry directly employs about 4 million workers and contributes indirectly to the creation of around 10 million jobs elsewhere in the economy. The RMG industry, which accounted for around one-third of total industrial production, has experienced an annual average growth rate of 10.5 percent over the past eight years...Low wages have helped Bangladeshi RMG exporters remain competitive since the inception of the industry.The fact is, countries do not start out rich; they start out poor, and they get rich by figuring out how to make things that people want. In Bangladesh, and in some other developing countries, the most valuable thing they've figured out how to make (in terms of total value created) is clothing. Making that clothing involved putting people to work for low wages in factories with poor conditions — in other words, sweatshops. This was true for Britain and the U.S. in our early industrialization periods; Bangladesh is simply following in our footsteps here.In my experience, \"sweatshops are bad\" is just one of those things that American progressives are supposed to believe — part of the canon, like the idea that incomes have stagnated since the 1970s or that defense spending is crowding out welfare spending. The idea is that greedy American capitalists hurt poor people in countries like Bangladesh by putting our factories there, just so we can have cheap shirts and blue jeans. This idea is partly rooted in a very reasonable disgust at the sort of working-conditions that prevail in sweatshops. But it also comes from two very old leftist notions. The first is the idea that factory owners unfairly exploit workers, who — according to Marx — ought to capture all of the value of what they produce. The second is the idea that the developed world — especially America and Europe — got rich by stealing resources from poor countries. The idea of sweatshops as a curse upon the global poor comes from the combination of these ideas — instead of stealing aluminum or diamonds, we're stealing poor Bangladeshis' labor, paying them wages far lower than what they deserve, and forcing them to destroy their health with poor working conditions. When I posted my chart of Bangladeshi poverty, Derek Guy responded with a lengthy defense of his initial indictment of sweatshops. Some excerpts:First, many things contribute to the lowering of poverty. To get a sense of how low-end garment work contributes to this, we have to narrow in on this variable...Lucky for us, two people have. In 2017, [Chris Blattman] and [Stefan Dercon] published a study with the first randomized trial of industrial employment on workers. They worked with five Ethiopian firms — a shoe factory and a garment factory among them — to hire applicants at random and see how their lives may or may not improve. Unsurprisingly, most workers quit within [a] month and returned to informal work or agricultural work. In those sectors, their pay was similarly low, but at least they didn't face the hazardous industrial work conditions. Crappy garment work, it turns out, was not better for them...[A]ny time the subject of sweatshops come up, someone who considers themselves to be an economist brings up the economic benefits of paid employment, no matter how low...But what are we arguing here? This woman committed suicide because she was forced to work dehumanizing 16-hour shifts. If she didn't produce enough that day, she would be fined, taking away money from the very little she was paid. Women in the factory say they are sexually abused — coerced into sex and asked to strip off their clothes for inspections. Their passports are held so they can't leave. These are often exploited migrant workers. When Rana Plaza [in Bangladesh] collapsed, it's notable that none of the workers wanted the international companies to pull out. They want work! They simply just want work under better conditions. If we view labor as a global issue, shouldn't we — as workers ourselves — be in solidarity with workers abroad?...[S]houldn't we push for better conditions? Why is it, when sweatshops are brought up, some wish to dismiss such concerns? Is it not possible for consumers to be smarter about their shopping, push for better conditions for workers abroad, and avoid cheap, trendy clothes that don't even make them happy in the long run, but require the immiseration of workers abroad?But Derek badly misreads the 2018 study by Blattman and Dercon. He claims that the study examines the impact of sweatshops on poverty. But it does not. This is from the abstract:Working with five Ethiopian firms, we randomized applicants to an industrial job offer, an \"entrepreneurship\" program of $300 plus business training, or control status. Industrial jobs offered more and steadier hours but low wages and risky conditions. The job offer doubled exposure to industrial work but, since most quit within months, had no impact on employment or income after a year. Applicants largely took industrial work to cope with adverse shocks. This exposure, meanwhile, significantly increased health problems.Basically, this study took some people who were already applying to work in sweatshops, and gave them the jobs they wanted, and then most of the people didn't like it and quit. That is an interesting and important result! It means that in the short term, some people can be wrong about the kind of jobs they would actually want (which has implications for assumptions about rationality). It also means that at any given moment, sweatshops probably have greater labor supply than they would if people had good information about what working in a sweatshop is like. But Blattman and Dercon's study does not say that sweatshops don't reduce poverty! First of all, it's obvious that many sweatshop workers do not quit — or at least, not nearly as fast as the subjects of this experiment. If every sweatshop worker quit rapidly, sweatshops would quickly run through the entire available labor pool. Someone keeps working in those factories, so there must be some difference between the typical sweatshop worker and the marginal job applicant. The study doesn't say anything about those existing workers.Even more importantly, Blattman and Dercon's study doesn't say what would happen if all the sweatshops in Ethiopia closed up shop. If all the existing workers at the existing sweatshops suddenly found themselves out of work, they'd go do something else — agriculture, or local services, or whatever. That increase in labor supply in the other poor-person occupations would probably drive down wages in those occupations, leading to an increase in poverty. And by this same token, Blattman and Dercon's study doesn't say what would happen if Ethiopia opened a lot more sweatshops. If government policy or foreign investment spurred the creation of a whole bunch of new garment factories in Ethiopia, it would increase labor demand. This would presumably raise both employment and wages in Ethiopian sweatshops, which would reduce poverty. So Derek Guy simply misread the implications of the Blattman and Dercon study. In fact, Chris Blattman himself jumped in to clarify that he agrees with me about the overall impact of low-wage manufacturing industries on poverty:I authored this study & I agree with [Noah] that the main thing driving most countries out of poverty is industrialization. In a weak economy, with few factories, and a few good non-farm options, industrial jobs are no more desirable than the other bad opportunities, but...a growing industrial sector, tends to compete for labor and overtime. Drive up wages and working conditions. It's a bumpy imperfect process but outside of oil. I'm not sure any other country has reached middle or high income another way.Fortunately, as I wrote in a follow-up tweet, we do have a lot of other research papers that do measure the impact of sweatshops on living standards. The tradeoff, unfortunately, is that because they tackle this bigger macro question, most of these papers are forced to use empirical methods that are much less solid and reliable than Blattman and Dercon's. Economic growth and poverty reduction are macroeconomic variables, as is nationwide investment into industries like garment manufacturing. The problem with macro variables, put plainly, is that there is a lot of stuff going on at once, and so it's hard to tell what causes what. Basically, to get any sort of intelligible result, you have to make some pretty strong assumptions about the order in which things happen, or about which variables affect which other variables. But when people try making the most reasonable assumptions they can, they keep coming up with the result that Bangladesh's garment boom was a major cause of its spectacular economic growth since 1990. For example, here's Islam (2019):This study attempts to explore the [statistical relationship] among economic growth rate, ready-made garments (RMG) exports earning and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow in Bangladesh. It uses time-series annual data for the period 1986–2018...The RMG exports earning significantly improves the economic growth rate both in the short run and long run. The more the RMG exports earning, the more will be the economic growth rate.And here are Jiban and Biswas (2022), who use a different statistical approach:Ready-made Garments (RMG) export earnings, which are almost 80% of the total exports of Bangladesh, have been recognized as one of the main catalysts for the recent development of the country. Therefore, the need to determine whether the RMG export had served as a mechanism for increasing the GDP growth as well as the economic development of the country is topical and pressing...Using data from 1990 to 2020 for Bangladesh, we have found long-run as well as short-run associations among RMG Export earnings, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and GDP growth...Our result supports the proposition that RMG export earnings are one of the main growth engines in Bangladesh and this sector leads growth in other sectors also in the long term.A similar paper by Paul (2014), who uses an approach similar to that of Islam (2019), finds the same result. And Tang et al. (2015), who look at four different countries, conclude that exports are important for growth in all four (though the relationship only holds true in some time periods and not in others). So although we don't really know for certain that sweatshop industries are a major force raising poor countries out of poverty, our best guess is that they are. As for the more immediate impact of sweatshops on poverty, we have somewhat better evidence on that question. We can look at the effect of trade liberalization policies — which encourage the creation of export-oriented sweatshops — on regions that get more sweatshops, versus regions that get fewer. Vasishth (2024) does this, and finds positive effects on health for the children of women in areas with lots of sweatshops:In this paper, I estimate the inter-generational health impact of maternal employment opportunities using evidence from the ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh. This industry was exposed to a trade liberalization policy in 2005, which generated spatial and temporal variation in the establishment of garment factories and therefore, potential employment opportunities for women. Using a difference-in-difference strategy, I find that the expansion of this sector improved the probability of neonatal survival for children who are born in areas that experience higher growth in employment opportunities post trade liberalization. This is driven by the improved labor market participation by mothers, enabling them to delay childbirth and improve their intra-household bargaining power. [emphasis mine]Unlike Blattman and Dercon's paper, Vasishth (2024) isn't a randomized experiment. But it gets a much broader look at the effects of sweatshops on poverty, because it doesn't just look at workers applying to work at sweatshops — it looks at everyone in the whole area where sweatshops are located. Remember that an important way that sweatshops raise wages is by increasing labor demand, forcing other employers to raise wages in order to retain their workers. So while it's not settled science, the evidence does clearly seem to indicate that sweatshops reduce poverty in poor countries — just as most economic theories would predict. If you're deeply invested in the progressive narratives of capitalist exploitation of workers and rich-world exploitation of poor countries, it's tempting to disregard, dismiss, or simply avoid reading this evidence. But we owe it to the world to do better than that. This isn't one of those issues where we can afford to get it wrong, because if we let ourselves buy into narratives that encourage bad development policies — such as restricting imports from poor countries, refusing to buy clothes made in those countries — it will be the world's most vulnerable who suffer. But what about Derek Guy's argument that we can push for better working conditions for sweatshop workers abroad? In fact, this is something that happens a lot. The U.S. has many mechanisms in place to demand and monitor better working conditions at factories that sell products here. And poor countries pretty much always start implementing minimum wages and stricter safety standards after they escape extreme poverty. These policies often happen after big industrial disasters, like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in the U.S. in 1911. After the Rana Plaza factory collapse in 2013, Bangladesh made a concerted effort to improve conditions in its garment industry. International retailers also put pressure on Bangladeshi factories to make life better for their workers. And lo and behold, it worked! Bossavie et al. (2023) find that these efforts did improve conditions and wages in the Bangladeshi garment industry:After the tragic factory collapse of Rana Plaza in 2013, both the direct reforms and indirect responses of retailers have plausibly affected workers in the Ready Made Garment (RMG) sector in Bangladesh. These responses included a minimum wage increase, high profile but voluntary audits, and an increased reluctance to subcontract to smaller factories. This paper estimates the net impact of these responses...As intended by the reforms, we find that increased international scrutiny improved working conditions by 0.80 standard deviations...[W]e do not find that workers' wages were negatively impacted: instead, the post-Rana Plaza responses increased wages by about 10%.That's a great outcome! But unfortunately, those improved conditions only apply to workers who still had jobs in the industry. It might be the case that well-intentioned activism to improve working conditions in poor countries slows down industrialization in ways that outweigh the direct benefits. Grier et al. (2023) think this is the case. They find that the reforms after the Rana Plaza collapse led to investment flowing out of Bangladesh to places where labor was still cheaper, leading to a slowdown in the Bangladeshi garment industry:This study investigates the impact of anti-sweatshop activism on garment industry employment and the number of firms in Bangladesh following the 2013 Rana Plaza factory disaster. The disaster led to activism that created two major brand-enforced factory fire and safety agreements. We...find that it led to 33.3 percent fewer garment factories in Bangladesh by 2016 and 28.3 percent fewer people employed in Bangladesh's garment industry by 2017. Given the importance of the garment industry in Bangladesh's development in providing a pathway out of extreme property, our finding raises important questions about the efficacy of anti-sweatshop activism.But Harrison and Scorse (2006) paint a brighter picture. Looking at the effects of anti-sweatshop campaigns in Indonesia in the 1990s, they find that some factories move out, but surviving factories hire their workers instead — at better wages and in better conditions:This paper analyzes the impact of two different types of interventions on labor market outcomes in Indonesian manufacturing: (1) direct US government pressure, which contributed to a doubling of the minimum wage and (2) anti sweatshop campaigns. The combined effects of the minimum wage legislation and the anti sweatshop campaigns led to a 50 percent increase in real wages and a 100 percent increase in nominal wages for unskilled workers at targeted plants. We then examine whether higher wages led firms to cut employment or relocate elsewhere. Although the higher minimum wage reduced employment for unskilled workers, anti-sweatshop activism targeted at textiles, apparel, and footwear plants did not. Plants targeted by activists were more likely to close, but those losses were offset by employment gains at surviving plants. The message is a mixed one: activism significantly improved wages for unskilled workers in sweatshop industries, but probably encouraged some plants to leave Indonesia.Of course, the way countries can retain jobs and improve wages and working conditions is to raise productivity. In the rich world, we often sneer at the idea of just choosing to raise productivity, because if we could, we would already have done it. The same is not necessarily true in developing countries, which often still have low-hanging policy fruit they can pick. One of these is technology adoption. Nayyar and Sharma's 2022 World Bank report recommends this:All in all, Bangladesh's emphasis must shift to broader considerations of efficiency and quality as it seeks to diversify its export basket and move up the value chain...Our report finds that firms with higher technology levels in Bangladesh's manufacturing sector perform better.They recommend that the garment sector — and other sectors — promote rapid technological upgrading. The really interesting question — which I don't think we know the answer to yet — is whether or not anti-sweatshop campaigns from America or Europe force poor countries to invest more heavily in technology and education. Higher wages and more expensive safety measures force factory owners to raise productivity or die.2 That could nudge inefficient managers into investing in better machines, and it might nudge poor-country governments to provide their people with more and better education. So while progressives like Derek Guy are way too dismissive of the economic benefits of sweatshops, their preferred solution to the problems — activism to force factories in poor countries to raise wages and improve working conditions — might be the right thing to do anyway. After all, Britain and the U.S. started out their industrialization by making a lot of cheap clothes with cheap labor, but they eventually moved on to higher-value, more capital-intensive stuff — and got far richer as a result, while also making working conditions much safer and more pleasant. Bangladesh would do well to follow in those footsteps next, and if activism by rich-world progressives gives it the nudge it needs to take the next steps, then that's all for the best. But if that activism simply causes garment factories to close en masse, robbing Bangladesh of its most important lifeline out of desperate poverty, well...that would be bad. So progressives in the rich world should be very careful here; it's someone else's lives and livelihoods that hang in the balance. Subscribe nowShare1Pakistan, as it happens, has also made major progress in reducing extreme poverty, but more through redistribution rather than growth. 2This isn't nearly as far-fetched as it might sound. In fact, one of the most prominent theories of the Industrial Revolution is that expensive wages in the UK sparked a tech boom that eventually became self-sustaining.",

      "content": "Many things in the world have not been named openly; and many things, even if they are admitted, have never been described. One is the unsung sensibility – a sentiment and power source, a secret reservoir, unmistakable and timeless, a variant of umbrage but hardly identical with it – known as spite.To talk about spite is to betray it. Spite operates through concealment and misdirection. Spite succeeds best when its motivations remain hidden from all but its intended target. Spite is forensic. Spite is a creative brief, born of a rejection that when veiled becomes fuel. To name spite, to draw its contours, requires sympathy. It requires ignoring the therapeutic establishment's hostility toward sustained grievance. Spite is particular. All great art is particular, rather than universal. The power of spite is its specific audience and its clear metric for success. Artificial intelligence cannot know spite.Radical specificity of audience and absolute clarity of intention should guide all art, of course. Unlike motivations that require external validation or internal satisfaction, spite generates its own justification through targeted vindication. Spite seeks to devastate through virtuosity. There can be no counter argument.Spite is neglected, formally. Aesthetic theory has sophisticated frameworks for analyzing beauty, sublimity, and the grotesque. Spite may be the most undertheorized force in creative achievement. Spite is engine and architecture, fuel and destination, providing creative energy, scaffolding framework, and ultimate goal.Spite cares little about style. Allusion or irony or pastiche are not the point. The work must be genuinely superior, technically unassailable, substantively beyond reproach. This is spite's burden and its distinction: it cannot cheat or rely on embroidery or polish. It must actually be better.Nobody creating out of spite wonders if the work is \"good\" in some abstract sense. There is no paralysis over audience. Spite just gets to work. Spite is unreasonable, obsessive. Spite may be the secret ingredient in so much considered \"great.\" Museums may be less a collection of noble works than a cabinet of unspoken fantasies.Spite wears a veil. The world should appreciate the work in ignorance of its catalyst. A spite-driven work is a legitimate cultural gift as well as an encrypted personal message.What follows is an attempt to establish spite as a coherent aesthetic category. It demands recognition if only because its influence on culture has been underestimated.1. To start generally: spite complicates our emotional taxonomy: it is neither the noble fury of righteous anger nor the clean utility of competition. Spite is more complex. Spite is the aesthetic of personal defiance, the transformation of dismissal into creative energy. It is an art form that disguises itself as a character flaw.2. Spite-motivated work exists within a dual economy of meaning. To the public, the work presents itself as achievement. While spite has an audience of one, the world is also needed to applaud and marvel. Spite is private and public. It operates simultaneously on exoteric and esoteric levels. The artist who agonizes over being misunderstood might learn from this.3. How much spite must be invisible in literary history! How many canonical works carry within them the genetic material of personal grievance? The hermetic nature of spite means that countless masterworks may be so motivated. We are mere bystanders.4. It matters not whether fulfillment comes in months, years, or decades. Spite plays the long game. This persistence enables dramatic irony: the protagonist knows something other characters do not.5. Spite has clarity of purpose. Spite demands that the work succeed so completely that mockery becomes impossible. But its targeted excellence cannot point too directly at its origin.6. Spite is a precise tool. It is sharp for detailed, specific work. Spite requires more attention to craft because of its target. The work must withstand the scrutiny of the one motivated to find fault.7. Spite's signature is surplus excellence, a level of achievement beyond the necessary. This is not the aesthetic of excess. There is a distinction between overkill and going overboard. Spite-motivated work aims for supernatural excellence.8. There is a crucial distinction between spite and resentment. Resentment is passive, an emotional stasis that feeds on itself without producing results. Spite involves productive paranoia: a heightened sensitivity to slight, dismissal, and condescension. The spiteful person curates an archive of injuries. But spite is generative. It transforms negative energy into positive action, rejection into individual achievement. The spiteful person does not stew.9. The moral framework of spite is vindication as the highest virtue and dismissal as the gravest sin.10. The aesthetic of spite privileges the understated over the obvious, the delayed over the immediate. Spite-driven achievement appears effortless while suggesting vast reserves of competence held in reserve. This is why spite often manifests in fields requiring technical mastery – classical music, architecture, epic poetry, sculpture, painting – where excellence cannot be faked and where there is a vast gap between amateur and professional.11. The biographical record systematically obscures spite's role because spite-driven creators rarely advertise their motivations. Exceptions to this rule include Artemisia Gentileschi's \"Judith Beheading Holofernes\" series or Michelangelo's \"The Last Judgment\" featuring Biagio's face on Minos, with donkey ears and a snake biting his genitals.[Artemisia Gentileschi, Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria, c. 1615-17 The National Gallery, London]12. Spite houses are another exception to the privacy rule. They present a public riposte to the systems that denied them. Their genius lies in weaponizing the rules.13. The Romantic movement's celebration of individual genius may partly represent a collective spite response to Enlightenment rationalism's dismissal of emotion and intuition. We read these works as philosophical statements, missing their origins in personal grievance. The secret history of modernism too may be written in spite.14. The reservoir of spite is always full, providing endless energy. Spite maintains intensity over remarkable periods. Its self-perpetuating quality makes spite the most renewable of creative resources.15. Spite aspires to provoke \"retrospective embarrassment\" in its target. This reversal of roles, this transformation of doubter into cautionary tale, represents spite's most sophisticated achievement.16. Spite's relationship to achievement differs from the internally motivated artistic drive. The spiteful person may accomplish things never aspired to. Spite-success cares little about the place of the work among works of its kind and caliber. It brings no pure joy of artistic expression. Its achievement is performance art.17. Spite has no opposite: it already exists in relation to what it opposes. Love can exist without hatred, joy without sorrow, whatever the sages say. But spite needs the specter of dismissal, which is not forgiveness. Spite is parasitic in the most literal sense: it requires a host reaction to give it life. But this dependency, rather than weakening spite, gives it its peculiar strength: spite feeds on what births it. Forgiveness yields other benefits. Dismissal is death.18. Spite requires no announcement. The achievement speaks for itself but there can be no declared victory, only a silent one that carries the full weight of vindication. But that can never be measured. Spite operates in silence.19. \"Each burns alike, who can, or cannot write, / Or with a Rival's, or an Eunuch's spite.\" (lines 30,31) Alexander Pope, An Essay on Criticism (1711).20. \"I like to write when I feel spiteful: it's like having a good sneeze.

      "content": "A review of this newsletter's search function will reveal that I've never before written the words \"Jeffrey Epstein\" in a Silver Bulletin post. In fact, I've referenced Epstein's surname just once in passing, quoting from an Elon Musk tweet that claimed President Trump \"is in the Epstein files\" — a conclusion that's now reportedly been shared with Trump.Part of that is about the sort of newsletter I'm trying to run here. There are only three of us; we cover a lot of things that aren't politics, and so we focus on stories that are either a little neglected or where we think we have some unique perspective to add. The other part of it is that, believe it or not, I'm not really a political junkie.Pretty much the only time I watch cable news is when it's on at the gym or the airport. I have a fair number of friends who work in media, but almost none are involved in politics as such. The one advantage this provides me with is that I'm sometimes able to avoid what I consider to be the biggest bias of all in political reporting, which is the tendency to vastly overrate how much people are following political news from day to day, which can make it hard to predict which stories permeate into the broader public.Subscribe nowThe media is more interested than the public in EpsteinOn July 7, the Justice Department claimed that Epstein did not have a \"client list\" and said it didn't expect to release any more files about his case to the public, contradicting implied promises by Attorney General Pam Bondi and Trump himself to provide more disclosure. In the three weeks since then, this has been overwhelmingly the lead political story, often framed around headlines like these. It's a \"nightmare\" for Trump that's hit \"escape velocity\" or could even lead to a \"death spiral.\" At the very least, it's overshadowing the rest of his agenda.There's some literal truth in the latter claim: House Speaker Mike Johnson shut down his chamber early to avoid votes on releasing further Epstein materials. And it doesn't take a degree in Bayesian reasoning to recognize that, however bad stonewalling on Epstein might look for Trump, whatever's in the files is probably worse.It's not just the liberal media making these assertions, either: people on the conspiracy-minded right like Steve Bannon and Michael Flynn have speculated about the political fallout, too.I can't really blame anyone for being obsessed with the story. Almost everything about Epstein, from the circumstances of his death to his alleged ties to intelligence agencies, raises as many questions as answers. There's been a lot of serious reporting on the topic that goes beyond memes like \"Epstein didn't kill himself\".But in many respects, the story is also tailor-made for gossipy cable news coverage. It's episodic, in the way that sports coverage or major jury trials often are. There's both the crime and the cover-up. You can approach it from a lot of angles — there's an entangled web of names and claims and counterclaims.1 But there's also enough breathing space — Epstein died almost six years ago — to provide plenty of time for punditry and speculation.The feeding frenzy around Epstein has caused some political junkies to forget that Trump is often impervious to consequences: that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and it wouldn't really cost him among his base. And although even Bannon has questioned that assumption in this case, so far the evidence that the broader public is greatly concerned about the details of Epstein is pretty thin.Google search traffic in the United States reveals that the peak of interest in the Epstein case a couple of weeks ago was only about one-third as high as the one surrounding tariffs in April. I know that might seem like an apples-to-oranges comparison, but tariffs are an interesting benchmark precisely because they're one of the few things that did produce notable political fallout for Trump.Trump's approval hasn't fallen among RepublicansBut isn't Trump's approval rating plummeting again? You can find plenty of headlines to that effect. But the overall impact is pretty modest in our tracking. On July 7, Trump's net approval rating was a −6.7, now, it's −8.4. I don't need to remind readers how easy it is to cherry-pick polling data to create a narrative that Trump is perpetually in a worsening crisis.Despite all that, I don't necessarily take for granted that Trump's floor is as high as it was in his first term. He's now a lame duck, and second-term approval ratings are generally lower. But almost by definition, this would require some erosion from his base — and so far, we aren't really seeing that.I asked Eli to pull data on partisan splits in approval ratings, comparing the most recent poll from each firm2 against the last survey from the same firm completed entirely before July 7. Among Republicans, Trump's approval has actually ticked up a point since Epstein became a focal point, while his disapproval rating has declined by one point.What about independents? Maybe that's where you'd expect to see more impact; they're less loyal to Trump and some independents are the types who distrust the establishment. But there's very little happening there, either. Trump's approval rating among independents is unchanged at 34 percent — not good, but it hasn't gotten any worse — while his disapproval has ticked up just one point, from 59 to 60.I won't show you the data for Democrats because it's exactly what you'd expect: his approval rating is unchanged at 8 percent, while his disapproval rose just slightly from 88 to 89.Sure, you can squint at these numbers and tell yourself there will be a happy ending for Democrats. Party identification isn't static; in theory, a voter could be so frustrated by Trump's handling of Epstein that they've not only disavowed Trump, but the entire Republican Party. And maybe we're just at the beginnings of Epsteingate. In the tables, polls are listed from top to bottom from most to least recent, and some fresh polls like YouGov show more of a decline than the consensus does. If MAGA voters are discouraged, that might show up in lower turnout in next year's midterms but not in polls of all adults or registered voters.But also, Epstein isn't the only story that you'd expect to place downward pressure on Trump's numbers. There's been a new round of tariffs. The One Big Beautiful Bill passed and it wasn't popular either. Trump bombed Iran, though that came in June before the Epstein story resurfaced.There remains a strong case that voters are concerned about the economy and the cost of living, but that everything else is priced in.More news coverage of Epstein might not hurt TrumpOn the left, there's been a pervasive tendency — I call it \"The Big Cope\" — to attribute whatever problems Democrats are having to media coverage. The nature of the complaints constantly shifts. The media is alleged to cover some stories, like Biden's age, too much, others (like \"democracy\") too little, and still others in the wrong way, like by focusing on political rather than policy implications.I haven't seen those complaints about media coverage of Epstein; instead the refrain is that anything other than Epstein is distraction that Trump coverts. Rather, it's an interesting test case precisely because there has been the wall-to-wall coverage of a negative story for Trump that liberals often clamor for. And yet, it's hard to discern any major impact on his approval numbers.Maybe that's because, as Bryan Walsh writes at Vox, the Epstein story crowds out others that are more important and/or also potentially problematic for Trump. The constraints in news coverage aren't what they used to be when most journalism is consumed online rather than in the print edition. But newsrooms have bandwidth that can only flex up so much, and consumers have a limited time and financial budgets. If they're reading about Epstein, that means they're not reading as much about other things. Epstein might be a bad story for Trump, but there are lots of bad stories for Trump. What is its value above a replacement-level day in the news cycle?There's also something about the \"strange new respect\" for taking the Epstein story seriously in high-prestige, center-left outlets like the New York Times that I find a little off-putting. As of mid-afternoon on Tuesday, the Times had run 178 stories that mention Epstein so far in July, up from a long-term baseline of around ten stray mentions a month:I don't deny that the story is newsworthy — though maybe not 6-stories-every-day-newsworthy — but now that it's Trump caught up in the crosshairs instead of people with a more liberal valence, it's gained more respectability even though not all that much new has been revealed about it. And the partisan polarization around Epstein is shifting, too. Shortly after his death in 2019, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to say that Epstein had been murdered in prison rather than killing himself. Now, that's evened out: in an Emerson poll last week, 41 percent of Democrats say Epstein was murdered as compared to 40 percent of Republicans. (So did 38 percent of respondents with postgraduate degrees, typically the group that consumes the most political news.)Normie voters aren't running tallies of New York Times stories. But they may nevertheless detect that this is now a story that liberal news junkies — not conservatives or their conspiracy-minded uncles — are interested in bringing up at every opportunity. Since these types of voters don't trust the media, their priors might shift toward thinking that there isn't much there.Personally, I've found myself oscillating between finding the underlying details of the case fascinating — maybe respectable college-educated, center-left types like me should have been paying more attention to Epstein all along — and a second instinct. In the way the Epstein story has hijacked the news cycle, and with the constant predictions of spiraling damage to Trump's political standing, it reminds me of another story that lent itself to episodic coverage: Russiagate.It's hard to overstate the extent to which every minor Russia-related revelation in the story made news in 2017 and 2018, completely taking over the Rachel Maddow Show, for instance, from its formerly more policy-wonkish past.3 Liberals were literally selling prayer candles labeled \"pee tape\" showing Robert Mueller as a saint-like figure, convinced that the walls were caving in around Trump. Facebook ads from Russian bot farms that made up an infinitesimal fraction of the content voters were consuming in 2016 were blown up into a huge scandal.I'll assert that Russiagate didn't end well for Democrats, but I'll admit that's hard to prove. Trump's approval rating did decline significantly in 2017 — more steeply than so far in his second term — and Democrats did have a pretty good 2018 midterm. What I think is clearer is that the obsessive coverage of the case probably insulated Trump from more serious scandals that came along later.We'll keep an eye on Epsteingate at Silver Bulletin. It may well be early days — whatever political consequences there are for Trump will flow from further substantive revelations and not breathless headlines.Still, I suppose I'm glad I didn't write about the story sooner. A week ago, Trump's net approval rating had fallen to -10.3 in our tracking, and at looked like predictions about a death spiral had a possibility of coming true. Since then, Trump's numbers have rebounded, and it looks like we're back to the usual pattern: the overwhelming majority of voters either already hate Trump, or are happy to shrug off his scandals.Silver Bulletin is a reader-supported publication.

      "content": "This post is public so feel free to share it.ShareLast week I made a guest appearance on Michael Burns' livestreaming show (you can watch the session here), and I told a story that I have narrated a number of times. It's something I get asked about pretty frequently on podcasts and shows, particularly when people want to know about my \"philosophical origin story\", specifically the portion that has to do with my starting my YouTube channel. I don't think I've written it down, though I have related it many times, and it is a really good story in my view, so perhaps it's about time I set it down in print. It also has the added bonus of making my wife and partner, Andi, look quite good due to the role she played, so that's a rather self-interested reason on my part to tell it to you.My work producing and uploading YouTube videos started back in 2010, but didn't really take off in earnest until 2011. Andi bought me a flipcam that was intended for me to use to record my summer trip with my children, and in fall of that year, I used it to record a few of the conference presentations I made (I think the only one I have still is this one on Plato's Dialogues and Active Learning).In spring 2011, I was teaching my final semester at Fayetteville State University. Andi and I had plans for me to move up to New York, where we would build a full life together, once the spring semester was finished. She suggested that I start videorecording my class sessions, and uploading them to YouTube. I was initially a bit skeptical about that idea. When it comes to technology, Andi is an early adopter who foresees and enjoys potentials new tech might provide, while I am temperamentally more conservative when it comes to trying or incorporating new things.I had already been videorecorded once teaching a class session, as part of a faculty development seminar I participated in during the 2009-2010 academic year. Our Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) had one of the techs come in with a massive camera to one of my Critical Thinking classes, during which I was teaching about inductive argumentation and inference. It was part of an experiment that they envisioned producing records that could go into our portfolios for promotion and tenure.What Andi proposed was something much more DIY, low-tech, and flexible. She ordered me a little tripod the flipcam would sit upon, and the idea was that I would record one of my class sessions, and then upload the video file as a resource for my students. That semester, I was teaching four sections of the same class, Introduction To Critical Thinking (a 100-level class required for all students at FSU), and we covered the same materials in each of the class sections, so recording just one of those class sessions each day would prove useful for all of the sections.I was initially reluctant, but Andi can be quite persuasive (not least because she is both smarter than me and arguably a better communicator), and conviced me to give it a try. There was quite literally nothing to lose by recording the class sessions. I could keep them just for my classes, or share them with the public — that was up to me. I scoffed at the idea of putting them out there on the internet, asking who would possibly want to watch me, an academic unknown (except in a very few small circles), teaching students at a small southern HBCU few people had heard of.Interestingly, one reason why my lectures from that Critical Thinking class ended up on YouTube in the first place was that the course management system we were using at the time, Blackboard, could not handle video uploads longer than just a few minutes. My class sessions generally ran around 45-50 minutes, depending on how quickly we got going in class. I couldn't even upload them into my own personal YouTube channel at that time, since back then YouTube allowed only 10 minute, then 15 minute, and then 20 minute video uploads.They did, however, make an exception for \"institutional\" channels, and university channels fell under that classification. So after class, I would download the raw video of the class session onto my office computer, place it into a shared drive, and then one of the IT people would take that file and upload it into FSU's own YouTube channel. Then, I'd provide that link in Blackboard to my students. That institutional channel is where all of those 2011 Critical Thinking videos are still hosted (you can find them in this playlist)I also recorded other videos at the time, including two guest lectures in colleague's classes, more conference presentations, a National Library Week talk on my recent book (which I remastered), and a series of short videos I called \"Dr Sadler's Chalk and Talk\". By the time the spring semester ended, and I was getting ready to leave FSU and move up to be with Andi in New York, YouTube began allowing individual users to upload longer videos.The comments that I got on the various videos were very revealing, and brought me to see the truth of some things that Andi had been saying to me all along. While there were a few trolls and pedants (there always are), for the most part they were quite positive. A number of people thanked me for uploading the lectures, which they found very helpful, not least because they were having difficulties in their own classes, and their instructors were not providing them with support, explanations, examples, or applications of the concepts. Many other people were grateful for uploading the class session recordings, and for quite a few of them, the fact that they were college classes in a classroom with a chalkboard was important. Some said that they either couldn't afford higher education or that they had, for a variety of reasons, to stop attending college or university. Others said that they had graduated from college some time ago, and missed getting to go to classes, and the videos gave them the feeling of being back in school.Quite a few other people asked questions about the concepts and distinctions we discussed, or about the examples I was using (some from the course text, others made up by me or my students on the spot). Viewers responded to each other occasionally as well, engaging in some side-conversations.After I left Fayetteville State University (and that's a long story which I can tell another time), and moved in with Andi up in the Hudson Valley in New York, I started teaching as an adjunct, this time for Marist College. At that time, they required two philosophy classes for their traditional on-campus students, a 100-level Introduction to Philosophy course and a 300-level Ethics course. In Fall 2011, I was slated to teach one section of each.I asked the department chair whether she would have any objection to me recording my classes and uploading the videos to my YouTube channel, and she was fine with it, even interested in seeing what I was doing, and how the videos could be used as resources for students. Since the students' voices would be on the videos (though rarely their images, unless they passed in front of the camera), I explained what educational purposes were served by videorecording the class sessions, and had them sign a FERPA release.So I uploaded the videos, in rather raw form, that first semester. We met generally twice per week for those classes, so that gave me a good bit of video content to upload and for people to watch, share, and comment upon. And they did. My own students watched the videos sometimes embedded in our course management system, but they ended up as the proverbial drop in the bucket compared to the sizable and growing viewership of students, lifelong learners, and even fellow professors all over the world. As opposed to the Critical Thinking class, where I was just leading students through a textbook, supplemented by some resources I developed for them, the Marist classes I got to choose what texts I would focus upon and have the students study. I'm a big believer that given proper support, undergraduate students can productively read primary texts in philosophy, so across these two classes, they read a range of thinkers. These included Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Epictetus, Anselm of Canterbury, Thomas Aquinas, Thomas Hobbes, Rene Descartes, Jeremy Bentham, Immanual Kant, Soren Kierkegaard, John Stuart Mill, Virgina Held, and Alasdair MacIntyre. So by the start of 2012, I had videos recorded in class on works by each of those, which then could be reused as course resources for new classes. You can see the videos from those two classes, expanded a good bit by the addition of later semesters' videos, in these two playlists:A Course In EthicsIntroduction To PhilosophyThe following semester, I taught Ethics again, two in-person sections of it this time, and I decided to mix up the schedule a bit, not least so that I could teach and record class sessions on additional texts and thinkers. I added in some W.D. Ross, Jean-Paul Sartre, Rosemarie Tong to the curriculum, all of which I recorded videos on. I also was asked to pilot an online 12-week Ethics class that semester, in which I used those class lecture and discussion videos as one main component of the resources I supplied my online students with.Once again, as I put out more of the videos, people all over the world watched and (mostly) enjoyed them, commented on them, shared them. I even had other professors start using them as resources for their own students. As the semesters went on, and I taught more Ethics and Intro to Philosophy courses (and then eventually Religion In American Culture and World Views and Values courses for Marist, I kept adding those recordings to the stock in my channel. Over those several early years, I gathered a rather vocal and appreciative following and got a reputation as a reliable and engaging online lecturer.There's more to say about the early years of my YouTube channel and online presence, but that's probably about enough for the moment, I think.

Recent appearances: Where I've been. Latest books: You keep readin' em, I'll keep writin' 'em. Upcoming books: Like I said, I'll keep writin' 'em. Colophon: All the rest. Boss-politics antitrust and the MAGA crackup (permalink) Trump conquered America by pulling together a coalition of groups that broadly hate the same things, but who differ sharply in what things they aspire to. This approach creates a broad and therefore powerful coalition, but it's also a brittle one: https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/18/winning-is-easy/#governing-is-harder Victory is deadly to any coalition that agrees on what they want to destroy, and violently disagree on what they want to build. Once victory is attained, some of those groups are going to get what they want, which means other groups are going to absolutely eat shit. Worse (for Trumpism) is that his coalition's affect is purely libidinal, a roaring mob of ragged tribes of swivel-eyed loons who believe they are doing battle with the \"deep state,\" \"Jewish space-lasers\" and \"antifa super-soldiers,\" and are primed to see shadowy cabals everywhere: https://pluralistic.net/2023/06/16/that-boy-aint-right/#dinos-rinos-and-dunnos For Trump, the only point of this coalition is to help him amass wealth and power, and so he has established himself as the ultimate arbiter of its conflicts. If you're the leader of a warring MAGA faction, your top winning move is to figure out how getting your way can personally benefit Trump. Which is why the Epstein scandal has knocked Trump so badly off balance: his coalition partners are unwilling to accept the idea that Epstein's death is a nothingburger, that the Epstein files are a hoax, that Ghislaine Maxwell is the victim of Democratic cabal lawfare. They're insisting that Trump go public with all the messy details of Epstein's sex-trafficking ring, even though Trump has made it abundantly clear that this would be personally disadvantageous to him, likely because of evidence that he sexually assaulted Epstein's underage victims. As Trump flails about in a bid to prevent an Epstein-driven MAGA crackup, more cracks are appearing. One of these runs straight through the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, which became a generationally important powerhouse under Biden, intervening to prevent monopoly formation and to break up existing monopolies in a way not seen since the 1960s. There's a strong antitrust wing in the MAGA coalition, the so-called \"right populists,\" many of whom associated themselves with Biden's brilliant FTC chair, Lina Khan, dubbing themselves \"Khan-servatives.\" For Trump – who never met a predatory corporate monster he didn't love – these MAGA trustbusters are useful idiots, because they let him practice \"boss-politics antitrust\": https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/12/the-enemy-of-your-enemy/#is-your-enemy You see, every major corporation in the US is a flagrant violator of antitrust law (thanks to decades of comatose antitrust enforcers). What's more, every major corporation in the US is hoping to violate more antitrust laws, primarily through illegal, anticompetitive mergers. For Trump, this presents a golden opportunity: given that there are so many guilty companies out there in the world, he can selectively prosecute the ones that he wants to make an example of and/or extract tribute from. This is what happened with the Colbert cancellation: Paramount wanted permission to complete a obviously illegal, anticompetitive merger with Skydance. Trump launched a bullshit suit against Paramount for not being sufficiently mean to Kamala Harris during the election. Paramount settled this suit – which Trump had a 0% chance of winning – for $16m, which is to say, they gave Trump a $16m bribe under the flimsiest of pretexts. Then, when Colbert made fun of them for doing this and Trump squawked, Paramount fired Colbert and cancelled his show. Finally, the merger was approved, on condition that Trump be allowed to place a political minder within CBS's news organization who would prevent them from publishing statements that Trump disliked in either his personal or governmental capacity. This is as blatant a violation of the First Amendment as the Paramount suit was, but if Paramount goes along with it, who's got standing to challenge the deal? That's where this all gets interesting: Donald Trump isn't the first president to hit on this strategy. Richard Nixon (AKA Trump beta 0.9) ordered his Justice Department to walk away from a case blocking one of International Telephone and Telegraph's illegal mergers because ITT had donated $400,000 to the RNC (yes, this is small ball compared to Donald Trump's scams, but again, Nixon was just the beta test). This enraged Congress (remember when Congress used to get enraged?) that Sen John Tunney introduced legislation that gives broad swathes of the public standing to challenge the DOJ when they appear to take bribes in exchange for favorable antitrust rulings. Under the Tunney Act, merger settlements that are \"against the public interest\" can be halted by a federal judge. Which brings me back to the MAGA coalition crackup. Last week, there was an attempted coup in the DOJ's Antitrust Division: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/an-attempted-coup-at-the-antitrust At issue was one of those \"Kahnservative\" antitrust enforcements. Right after the Trump inauguration, HPE and Juniper Networks, two of the biggest enterprise WLAN companies, announced a $14b merger, which was immediately opposed by Trump's new DOJ antitrust enforcers. Trustbusters took this as a sign that Trump was going to let his \"right populist\" wing hold the whip-hand over corporatist parts of his coalition. But by June, the DOJ moved to settle the case, dropping the announcement after close-of-business on a Friday, which is as close as the government is legally allowed to come to simply not mentioning it at all. The merger would proceed with the most pro-forma, nonsensical, weaksauce conditions. HPE's shares shot up by 11% and some insider trader made a killing exercising a gazillion HPE call options just before the announcement dropped: https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1939750029230494049 One of Trump's mouthiest coalition members, the MAGA influencer Mike Davis, had been a vocal opponent of the merger, but after it sailed through, we learned that he'd gotten a seven-figure job with HPE to serve as their fixer with the Trump administration: https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/top-trump-administration-antitrust-official-faces-criticism-over-approach-sources-say/ AG Pam Bondi's Chief of Staff Chad Mizelle overruled the DOJ's antitrust boss, Gail Slater (a former JD Vance staffer) and accepted the bullshit HPE deal. Various Trumpies spoke out against it, like Laura Loomer, who posted an outraged jeremiad against the merger deal, then deleted it (Loomer claimed that Mizelle had waded into the deal in order to help his wife, Judge Kathryn Mizelle, secure a seat on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals): https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/1949995374606745741 Now, two of Gail Slater's top aides – Roger Alford and Bill Rinner – have been fired: https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/1949963841455956084 As David Dayen writes for The American Prospect, this is a disturbing precedent, given all the antitrust cases currently being fought by the DoJ, involving Apple, Google, Visa, Livenation, Realpage, etc: https://prospect.org/power/2025-07-29-law-could-blow-open-trump-antitrust-corruption/ But, Dayen says, the Tunney Act means that every one of these deals could be an opening for a Tunney Act challenge, which would include \"communications between agents of the companies and employees of the United States.\" It would force the judges in the case to determine \"whether lobbying concerns took precedence over the public interest.\" And the judge who's overseeing the HPE/Juniper deal is a Biden appointee, Casey Pitts, who worked for a firm specializing in labor, environmental and civil rights cases. So this is an opportunity to demonstrate that Trump's DOJ is a pay-for-play shop, something that will help the \"right populist\" side of the MAGA coalition whip up their supporters against the corporatist wing. This is a pretty good gambit, especially given how much parts of the MAGA coalition hate Big Tech: https://jacobin.com/2025/07/big-tech-trump-antitrust-lawsuits/ This isn't anywhere near as big as the Epstein scandal, but nevertheless, it's a situation in which Trump's own self-interest can only be served by doing something that his most vocal and easily enraged base hate. It's another fracture line in the coalition that a smart opposition (yeah, I know) could hammer on.

      "content": "\"If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales,\" Einstein reportedly told one mother who wished for her son to become a scientist. \"If you want them to be very intelligent, read them more fairy tales.\" Given that the deepest measure of intelligence is a plasticity of being that allows us to navigate uncertainty, given that uncertainty is the pulse-beat of our lives, fairy tales are not — as J.R.R. Tolkien so passionately insisted — only for children. They are more than fantasy, more than fiction, shimmering with a surreality so saturated that it becomes a mirror for what is realest in us, what we are often yet to see. They enchant us with their strangeness because we are largely strangers to ourselves, ambivalent in our yearning for transformation, for redemption, for homecoming, restless in our longing to unmask the face of love and unglove the hand of mercy. They ask us to believe in magic and reward our trust with truth. Art by Maurice Sendak for a special edition of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales Fairy tales are above all in service of life's most difficult, most unfinishable task — knowing who we are and what we want. Their most revelatory function is to remind us that, because we know ourselves only incompletely, we don't always know what we are looking for until we find it, often by way of getting lost, or until it finds us, often in a guise we don't immediately recognize as the very thing we long for. That is what Italian writer Cristina Campo (April 29, 1923&ndash;January 10, 1977) explores in her excellent posthumous essay collection The Unforgivable: And Other Writings (public library). Observing that many fairy tales \"end like a ring right where they began,\" she writes: In a fairy tale, there are no roads. You start out walking, as if in a straight line, and eventually that line reveals itself to be a labyrinth, a perfect circle, a spiral, or even a star — or a motionless point the soul never leaves, even as body and mind take what appears to be an arduous journey. You seldom know where you are traveling, or even what you are traveling toward, for you cannot know, in reality, what the water ballerina, or the singing apple, or the fortune-telling bird may be. Or the word to conjure with: the abstract, culminating word that is stronger than any certainty. One of Kay Nielsen's stunning 1914 illustrations for Scandinavian fairy tales. (Available as a print and as stationery cards.) Through these routeless convolutions, we map the terra incognita of your own interior world. In a passage evocative of the Chinese notion of wu-wei — \"trying not to try\" — Campo considers the paradox of self-discovery: Since the thing you start out looking for cannot and must not have a face, how can you recognize the means to reach it until you’ve reached it? How can the destination ever be anything but an apparent destination? [...] No one arrives at the enlightenment he sets out to seek. It will come to him in its own sweet time. Thus the destination walks side by side with the traveler... Or it hovers behind him... In truth, the traveler has always had it within him and is only moving toward the motionless center of his life: the antrum near the spring, the cave — where childhood and death, in one another’s arms, confide the secret they share. The idea of travel, effort, and patience is paradoxical, yes, but it is also exact. For in this paradox, we stumble on the intersection of eternity and time. It is hardly surprising that, in their central project of loosening the clutch of certainties we call a self, fairy tales blur the ordinary experience of time — time, after all, is the substance we are made of. Another of One of Kay Nielsen's Scandinavian fairy tales illustrations. (Available as a print and as stationery cards.) In a passage brimming with the musicality Maurice Sendak considered the key to great storytelling, Campo — the daughter of a musician and a composer — writes: The geometry of time and space is abolished as if by magic. You walk for hours in a circle, or conversely, you reach the edge of the infinite in a few quick steps. It isn’t our state of heightened vigilance that casts a spell on the world around us; it is a much more recondite correspondence between discovering and letting ourselves be discovered — between giving shape and taking shape. Everything already was, but today it truly is. Today any peasant, pointing in any direction, will sound like a gnome or a fairy, will gesture at the path you nearly took a thousand times without suspecting it. The path that leads to four indescribably white springs suspended on the hillside, protected, for a hundred paces or a thousand miles, by fields of tall fragrant grasses; or to the royal tomb hidden by the Etruscans in a cave now covered with brambles, out of which white hounds and a man the size of an ifrit, carrying a shotgun, emerge; or down below the ridge secretly lighted by the sun, at a bend in the riverbank so deep it casts the whole hanging tangle of pink roots into shadow. Velvet water that looks motionless and yet moves. Water that runs off into the beyond without flowing, so that it would be enough just to follow it, for that beyond which is always forbidden, always intimated in our dreams, is transpiring here and now. I am thinking now of Hannah Arendt's magnificent meditation on love: “Fearlessness is what love seeks,\" she wrote. \"Such fearlessness exists only in the complete calm that can no longer be shaken by events expected of the future… Hence the only valid tense is the present, the Now.” Perhaps this is why love is the central axis of most fairy tales, why love in real life has a certain dreamlike quality, why both love and dreams are ways of getting to know the stranger in us. \"In each of us there is another whom we do not know,\" Carl Jung wrote, \"[who] speaks to us in dreams.\" One of teenage artist Virginia Frances Sterrett's 1929 illustrations for French fairy tales. (Available as a print and stationery cards.) There is the same dreamlike quality and the same capacity for revelation in the state we enter once a fairy tale ejects us from time and thrusts into nowness. Campo paints the dreamscape we enter: Quick glances direct our steps, hands point beyond the thresholds. Behind windowpanes so clear they blind us move the figures of the ones we loved, the ones we’ve lost, who, behold, stand up from the piano bench or arrange fruit on a table. It all unfolds like a scroll from a mouth known yet unknown, a dark and luminous sentence, an irrefutable commentary set down between past and future. In being both a portal between the known and the unknown and a still point between past and future, fairy tales help us discern our own nature by guiding us toward the deepest truths of who we are and helping us apply them to the mystery of being alive — a nonlinear process the fruits of which we call maturity. Campo writes: Maturity is not the result of persuasion, much less an intellectual epiphany. It is a sudden, I would almost like to say biological, collapse. It is a point that must be reached by all the senses at once if truth is going to be turned into nature. Complement with Polish Nobel laureate Wisława Szymborska on fairy tales and the necessity of fear and Anaïs Nin on the meaning of maturity, then revisit the greatest illustrations from 200 years of Brothers Grimm fairy tales. donating = lovingFor seventeen years, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the outgrown name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

But think, post American hegemony, not Chinese hegemony but rather (hopefully peaceful) balance-of-power, and of influence, global politics. Trump's chaos-monkey nature, internal dysfunction, and strategic myopia have indeed opened the door. When the world's policeman hangs up his badge and becomes a mafia extortion-racket chieftain, the world notices. China may well have an opportunity for hegemony, but it is unlikely to walk through the door...ShareShare Brad DeLong's Grasping RealityShare Brad DeLong's Grasping RealityThe answer is: Yes, the path to future U.S. hegemony is now closed.America's grip on global leadership didn't slip—it has been rapidly pried loose by incompetence, distraction, and a studied indifference to history. It is now being deliberately chosen, piece by piece, by those who mistake chaos for strategy and retreat for renewal. The end of U.S. hegemony wasn't inevitable, and could be being accomplished so quickly only by a strange régime of chaos monkeys, kleptocrats, and grifters. China could seize the initiative to become the new hegemon of a new and different ordo saeclorum. But I think it is no more likely to grasp this nettle than the U.S. was back in 1920.The long arc of U.S. global dominance, from 1945 to 2020, has ended not with a bang but with a series of self-inflicted wounds. Domestic dysfunction, foreign policy vacillation, and the willful neglect of alliances are now swiftly undermining American influence, credibility, and leadership. What will be left is a vacuum, most likely to be only partially filled, and filled by a balancing of power chaos rather than any new order structured by hegemony. Not Beijing's ambitions but Washington's abdication are likely to be at the fore here.Give a gift subscriptionNoah Smith has a nice piece about how Donald Trump and his grifter-enablers are doing a huge number of things to accelerate China's relative technological, economic, and geopolitical rise, and how now \"the path to hegemony looks a lot smoother for China than it did nine months ago\". He gives good, cogent reasons:Noah Smith: Trump is enabling Chinese power <https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/trump-is-enabling-chinese-power>: 'An incompetent, selfish, inwardly focused administration is making America less of an obstacle to China's rise.... Beginning in Donald Trump's first term... it seemed as if the world was moving into Cold War 2.... Trump had a reputation as a China hawk... [but] now seemed to have abandoned the idea... against... TikTok divestment... cancel[ing] the bipartisan CHIPS Act that represented America's best hope of retaining meaningful semiconductor manufacturing capacity. Why would Trump switch from a China hawk to an appeaser?...As in so many cases, Trump's actual policies... have been inconsistent, confusing, and sometimes hastily reversed.... Why did Trump cave on H20 chips and design software? The most obvious reason is that Trump has simply chickened out yet again. China has been hurting the U.S. with its own export controls on rare earths.... [hat] bodes ominously for the strategy of economic containment that Biden's people developed....China... has a natural advantage in scale... key to reducing manufacturing costs.... The only way for the U.S. to rival China's scale would be to essentially combine its markets with those of other countries... U.S. allies.... It is exactly those allies that Trump is attacking with his latest round of tariffs. Having backed off of his China tariffs after finding that country to be too hard a target, Trump is looking for wimpier countries to bully....Now, because of culture-war concerns, Trump is attacking government research.... An attempt to push Chinese talent out of America... ends up strengthening China and weakening the U.S.... Every day... a new policy that will weaken America's hand against China. For example... [shipbuilding].... \"the NSC shipbuilding office closing... [and] zero follow-through on Trump's State of the Union promise to open a dedicated White House shipbuilding office...\". This doesn't seem like deliberate Trump administration sabotage of America's naval power; it's too chaotic and involves too many bad actors and competing interests. Instead... simply... extreme incompetence.... The U.S. is purging its diplomatic corps....Trump himself is too irresolute, cowardly, and focused on personal enrichment. Too many of his subordinates harbor an isolationist view of geopolitics. The administration in general is too incompetent, too bereft of human capital, and far too focused on prosecuting domestic culture wars by burning down any institution they see as harboring wokeness.... With Trump making America more and more of a geopolitical nonentity, chaos agent, and wild card, the path to hegemony looks a lot smoother for China than it did nine months ago....

It is more a manager of alliances—not strong enough to dominate, yet powerful enough to lead, while being restrained enough to maintain the consent (or at least acquiescence) of those it leads rather than having its throwing its weight around trigger the formation of a countervailing balance-of-power coalition. \"Hegemony\" is neither a birthright nor a permanent condition; it is a practice, fragile and perishable, dependent on the continual renewal of both material capabilities and the legitimacy of leadership.My old teacher Charlie Kindleberger used the term \"hegemony\" to denote the unique and indispensable role played by a dominant power in stabilizing the international economic system in his 1973 The World in Depression, 1929–1939, which remains the gold standard of comparative economic history. Kindleberger powerfully argued that it was the absence of a willing and able hegemon—specifically, the United States's failure to take on that role—in the interwar years that was was the root cause of the Great Depression's depth and duration. Britain, the previous hegemon, had become too weak. America, the rising giant, was too parochial and inward-looking. Kindleberger's insight was that global order is not self-organizing. It requires a state willing to provide public goods—market access, liquidity, coordination, and, when necessary, a lender of last resort. Without a hegemon to shoulder these burdens, the system devolves into beggar-thy-neighbor policies, competitive devaluations, and, ultimately, collapse. His analysis was not merely historical: it was a pointed warning to all who would assume that international capitalism can function without leadership. Kindleberger's vision of hegemony is not about domination, but about responsibility—the willingness to act, often at some cost to oneself, for the stability of the whole.Robert Keohane broadened the concept beyond the study of purely international economic order in his 1984 After Hegemony: Cooperation and Discord in the World Political Economy. (Ironically, Keohane's central point was that even though the U.S. could no longer be a successful hegemon its previous building of institutions like the IMF, the World Bank, GATT, and the UN meant that the international order it had constructed would continue—but the U.S.'s ability to be a successful hegemon was then rising, and would not fall back to below its 1970s level until the 2016 election of Donald Trump.) In the hands of Keohane and others like Stephen Krasner, Susan Strange, and John Ikenberry, \"hegemony\" became a framework for analyzing not only the provision of economic public goods, but also the construction and maintenance of security alliances, the shaping of international norms, and the creation of durable institutions. \"Hegemonic stability theory\" posited that the presence of a dominant, rule-setting power—be it the British Empire in the 19th century or the United States in the post-1945 era—was essential for the functioning of a liberal international system. When the hegemon was strong and engaged, the world saw relative peace, open markets, and institutional innovation; when the hegemon faltered or withdrew, the system became vulnerable to fragmentation, rivalry, and crisis.Get 50% off a group subscriptionWe can think of hegemony as having four dimensions:Geostrategic hegemony is the condition in which a single state possesses sufficient military power, willingness, and ability to shape the security architecture, strategic alignments, and conflict outcomes across the globe. Having the largest army and the most advanced technology helps. But the key is being the indispensable power whose preferences, red lines, and guarantees structure the choices of others. The United States, for example, achieved geostrategic hegemony in the post-World War II era by stationing troops across Europe and Asia, underwriting alliances like NATO and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and establishing itself as the ultimate arbiter in crises from Berlin to Korea to the Persian Gulf. This status enabled Washington to deter rivals, reassure allies, and, at times, impose order (or disorder) according to its own interests and values. Political hegemony is the condition in which a single state or actor possesses the capacity to set the rules of the game for the international political system—not merely through coercion or the threat of force, but by shaping the institutional architecture, agenda, and norms that govern how states interact. It is about being the \"rule-maker\" rather than the \"rule-taker,\" the actor whose preferences and priorities are encoded in the treaties, organizations, and informal practices that structure world politics. Political hegemony is not simply a matter of having the most votes or the loudest voice; it is about the ability to build coalitions, set agendas, and define what is legitimate or illegitimate conduct on the world stage. This form of hegemony is inherently dynamic and contested: it requires constant investment in diplomacy, alliance management, and the maintenance of legitimacy, and it is always vulnerable to challenge from rising powers, revisionist actors, or shifts in the underlying distribution of capabilities and ideas.Economic hegemony is when a single nation both has the power and steps up to set the rules and provide the public goods that underpin the global economic system. This is not simply a matter of having the largest GDP or the deepest capital markets—although those certainly help—but of being the anchor of international finance, trade, and payments. The economic hegemon is the country whose currency serves as the world's reserve asset, whose markets are open to imports, whose banks provide liquidity in times of crisis, and whose policymakers are looked to for coordination and leadership. Britain in the nineteenth century, with the pound sterling as the global means of settlement and London as the world's banker, played this role. The United States assumed the mantle in the twentieth century, first hesitantly and then decisively after World War II.Cultural hegemony is the ability of a dominant society or state to shape, define, and naturalize the values, beliefs, tastes, and everyday assumptions of others—so thoroughly that its worldview becomes the default or \"common sense\" for much of the world. This is not simply about exporting pop music, movies, or fast food, although Hollywood and McDonald's are certainly part of the story. Rather, it is about setting the terms of aspiration and legitimacy: what counts as modern, desirable, or even normal. In the twentieth century, American cultural hegemony became manifest in everything from the global spread of English, to the adoption of blue jeans, to the near-universal aspiration to \"middle-class\" lifestyles and consumer culture. More subtly, it was visible in the spread of liberal individualism, the valorization of entrepreneurship, and the framing of democracy and human rights as universal ideals. When it works, it is the quietest and most enduring form of power: it shapes not just what people do, but what they want.Refer a friendWe had U.S. hegemony in all four dimensions from 1945 to 2020—with some signs of it cracking in the 1970s, and then again in the 2000s as George W. Bush degraded the Western Alliance to a \"coalition of the willing\", and then again in the late 2010s as other powers and global citizens frantically tried to figure out how to corral the chaos monkey-nature of Donald Trump I. Do we still have it today? I would argue no: Culturally, from the rest of the world's perspective the country of mass shootings by AR-15 that can elect Donald Trump twice is not anything that anybody outside the United States will aspire to and see as a legitimate example of what is desirable, modern, and normal. It's not something any group of other people save for other countries' own neofascist grifting would-be élites would want.Economically, the grave damage done by Trump to American public- and nonprofit-sector science will be a huge handicap. But there is more. Add to that the near-cessation of immigration of the talented and the entrepreneurial. And add to that the near-enserfment of non-citizens: It is not just those without proper papers who now have to be willing to cut their wage demands enough that their employers do not have an incentive to drop a dime to ICE the day before payday. H1B visa=holders must be similarly wary, and similarly eager to go the extra mile to make sure their employers are getting enormous surplus. Plus green-card holder permanent residents: all Kristi Noem has to do is ask, and Marco Rubio will then immediately revoke your green card and deport you for no reason at all save that someone with in some Trumpist affinity does not like your face.The creation of such a massively exploitable labor underclass of non-citizens (and citizens who don't look white enough) is not a full-fledged Jim Crow like the system that kept the American South relatively very poor and its Bourbon aristocracy so dominant in the century after the Civil War. But it definitely does trend in that direction.No: the likelihood that the American economy will be strong enough to support economic hegemony in the future is now low. More important, the United States will not be trusted to follow-through. And a leader needs the confidence of others that there will be follow-through. American economic hegemony is gone.Politically, do not make me laugh. The rule of chaos-monkey Trump is that there are no rules. The concept of hegemon simply does not apply. We have, rather, balance-of-power international politics, in which the power that thinks it has predominant force is often surprised by the strength of the countervailing coalitions its attempts to throw its weight around assembles.And geostrategically? Under Trump, there are no red lines: TACO. There are no guarantees: Trump's word is simply not good. There are barely preferences. The likelihood that Trump's Pentagon can manage the creation and maintenance of an effective force rather than degenerate into a free-for-all wealth-diversion feast is very low. There is lots of money in the Pentagon to grab. Prime contractors know how to grab it. Plus all of those kitchens in Vienna, Virginia will not remodel themselves. Remember that this is already the Pentagon that could spend $2.3 trillion on the War in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021, and end up with Afghani anti-Taliban forces much weaker than the Northern Alliance had been in August 2002. Without adult supervision. I would be very wary of expecting anything good from sending the U.S. military as it will have become in 2029 into harm's way.Hegemony is not a birthright. It is a practice, renewed daily by choices—some grand, some mundane. The U.S. had immense resources, allies, and reservoirs of goodwill in 2016. But these assets have and are now being squandered at an extraordinarily rapid rate, definitely in part by simple malice, but even more so by neglect, confusion, and the ever-present temptation to turn inward.Some people say that come 2029 we can simply rewind things back to 2016, and pretend that nothing in between ever happened. Right.ShareBut that U.S. hegemony is gone does not mean that China's hegemony is next. Hegemony as we have known it is, after all, a post-1870 thing, with the rise of the British Empire in the world of full economic globalization. From 1815 to 1870 Britain was predominant but not hegemonic. From 1643 to 1815 France was the most powerful militarily and the most emulated cultural power, but not hegemonic as it was again and again constrained by the balance-of-power formation of counter \"grand alliances\". And from the suppression of the Comuneros in 1521 and the Germanias in 1522 to 1643, it was imperial Habsburg Spain that was predominant, but again its throwing its weight around created constraining countervailing coalitions. It requires an international environment culturally, economically, politically, and strategically conducive for it to emerge: one like the post-1870 fully globalized world, or the Aegean Sea between -478 and -454, when Perikles moved the Delian League's treasury from Delos to Athens, and began embezzling its funds.China does, as Noah Smith notes, have enormous obstacles to making the 2000s a Chinese century, or even to its own successful economic development and long-run political stabilization. It faces internal power struggles, demographic headwinds, and the limitations of authoritarian governance. Plus it is hard to see China putting the global-cultural and geostrategic jenga blocks in place here—although the economic and political blocks could be attainable, should things break right in terms of economic growth and political stability, and should the Chinese élite be interested in the project.But they will probably not be. The maintenance of hegemony is an exercise in self-discipline. It requires investment—in alliances, in research, in human capital—and a willingness to subordinate short-term interests to long-term stability. The alternative is a world in which the rules are written elsewhere, or rules are written not at all. Both Britain and the United States developed foreign-policy élites in the 1860s and 1940s, respectively, that were powerful and committed to the hegemonic prospect. I do not see analogous patterns developing now within China.Share Brad DeLong's Grasping RealityReferences:Bremmer, Ian. 2012. Every Nation for Itself: What Happens When No One Leads the World.

      "content": "1 Introduction The Rationalists are a group of people, largely in the Bay Area, who spend their time on the internet site LessWrong and make a great show out of trying to come to their beliefs rationally. They're disproportionately utilitarians, atheists, physicalists, moral anti-realists, and fans of Eliezer Yudkowsky, the core founder of the movement. They also tend to be pretty worried about AI. I'm not a Rationalist for the same reason I'm not a Catholic. I don't have problems, in principle, with their attempt to uncover the mysteries of the universe. I just think they're substantively mistaken on doctrinal matters. Similarly, I'm not a Rationalist because the Rationalists are almost certain of various claims that I don't think are true (and because they downvote my posts to the moon whenever I post on LessWrong). Sam Kriss, however, has a deeper objection to, in his words, \"utilitarianism, AI, and Eliezer Yudkowsky in particular,\" as well as \"truth,\" which he expressed in a recent essay. Now, I'm not usually inclined to defend Eliezer. I have in fact written 9,000 words about Eliezer being wrong and overconfident (an event that started the most respectful firestorm I've ever witnessed, on account of the aggrieved parties mostly being EAs—a group that is generally superhumanly nice). But Kriss's critique was more fundamental—directed towards those who attempt to discover truth. My criticism of Yudkowsky is that he has wrong beliefs; Kriss's is with the Rationalist truth-discovering project entirely. So, in the spirit of protestants and Catholics uniting to argue for mere Christianity, here is my defense of Rationalism, utilitarianism, and even Eliezer Yudkowsky. Note that unlike some people, I am no Sam Kriss hater. Admittedly, his paragraphs are much too long for a member of Gen-Z with the attention span of a goldfish like myself. But I find his essays funny, interesting, and clever. One of my favorite essays ever was his reply to Yarvin (I have no opinion on the substance, but the style is beyond hilarious). I particularly enjoyed the line:When Yarvin decides to dispute my claim that Israel is 'systematically' killing the inhabitants of Gaza, he puts forward two arguments. One is a thought experiment based on the yellowness quotient of a block, the other is a thought experiment based on the sizes of different fruits. Powerful stuff! 'How about some logic?' he begins. I'm such a foppish littérateur, you see, that I simply can't understand tough left-brain stuff like the yellowness or otherwise of a block.On the other end of the Kriss spectrum, I found his essay about the death of his best friend to be one of the most heartwrenching and thoughtful pieces I've read. I rarely get emotional reading articles. I did get emotional reading this one. If you don't read Kriss, at least occasionally, you are missing out. Too much Kriss might turn your brain to mush, but Kriss in low doses is a necessary part of a flourishing existence. So with all those nice things said about Kriss out of the way, let me get to my fundamental problem with Kriss's essay: nearly everything in it is wrong or confused. 2 Fact and fiction Sam sometimes writes in the ambiguous twilight zone between truth and fiction. Some rationalists don't like that. Eliezer thinks he should have a content warning so that people aren't misled. I don't really agree—I think that the way Kriss writes is fine. On Rationalism, Kriss writes:Rationalism is the notion that the universe is a collection of true facts, but since the human brain is an instrument for detecting lions in the undergrowth, almost everyone is helplessly confused about the world, and if you want to believe as many true things and disbelieve as many false things as possible—and of course you do—you must use various special techniques to discipline your brain into functioning more like a computer. (In practice, these techniques mostly consist of calling your prejudices 'Bayesian priors,' but that's not important right now.) I like some rationalists, and I've even written an entirely truthful piece for one of their publications, but my own perspective is different. I think the universe is not a collection of true facts; I think a good forty to fifty percent of it consists of lies, myths, ambiguities, ghosts, and chasms of meaning that are not ours to plumb. I think an accurate description of the universe will necessarily be shot through with lies, because everything that exists also partakes of unreality. And probably the best piece of evidence for my view is rationalism itself. Because in their attempts to clearly separate truth from error, they've ended up producing an ungodly colloid of the two that I could never even hope to imitate.Spoiler: the \"ungodly colloid\" is the fact that one of the main texts that convinced people of Rationalism is a Harry Potter Fan Fic called Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality written by Yudkowsky, plus the fact that people concerned about AI have likely accelerated AI progress (they've also, of course, massively ramped up effort into safely aligning AI). How this has broad implications for what truth is like is beyond me. Kriss's paragraph strikes me as extremely confused. What in the world does it mean that the universe is a collection of true facts? The universe is a collection of things, not of facts. Certainly chairs are part of the universe, but \"chair\" isn't a fact. It's an object. Talk about what percent of the universe is different things is similarly nonsensical—what percent of the universe is math? What percent is ideas? Unless you're talking about what portion of the mass in the universe has some property (being carbon, for instance) talking about what percent of the universe consists of various abstract properties doesn't seem coherent. Of course the universe contains stories, myths, and so on. No Rationalist would dispute that! And what in the world does it mean that \"everything that exists also partakes of unreality?\" The only thing I'm confident that partakes of unreality is that claim! It's fine to ramble poetically, but you can't do poetic rambling if your aim is to explain the errors other people are making. It wouldn't do, for instance, to act as if I've refuted Kriss by saying:Kriss's essay attempts to muddle the divide between truth and falsity, fact and fiction, to combine reality with unreality until it solidifies into a void beyond the outer reaches of being, a hideous and putrid darkness that envelops and engulfs, that takes and devours, a black hole ever more ravenously devouring the last vestiges of meaning and goodness from the subject he investigates, that remains eternally hungry, always wanting more, demanding more, tossing great hideous belches of noxious green and yellow vapors out across the universe until more is provided and the last remnants of meaning have gone.Kriss spends a lot of his essay snarking about Yudkowsky's fan-fiction book and claiming that it's the reason Rationalists hold a lot of their beliefs. While I enjoyed HPMOR, I would never dare challenge Kriss on aesthetic matters. Kriss is an aesthete—when scientists open up his brain to study him posthumously, they will notice that each of the brain regions responsible for artistic appreciation have swelled up in his skull like a balloon, violently colonizing the other brain regions. His artistic sensibilities are, by conservative estimates, at least 250 billion times more potent than mine. However, when he ventures away from art and fiction into the land of reality and says things with propositional content, the situation grows rather more dismal. For example, his claim that HPMOR was responsible for convincing people of many core Rationalist ideas is not correct. HPMOR's aim was to expose people to Rationalist ideas via fiction. It was not the origin of the ideas it advocates. Kriss confuses a vessel for communicating Rationalist ideas with the origin of those Rationalist beliefs. Now, Sam titles his article \"Against Truth.\" It's hard to see how one can coherently be against truth. Perhaps one can think that at the margins some people are too focused on figuring out truth—if there was a group that was hyper fixated on learning as many digits of pi as possible, such a group would be pathological. But knowing all sorts of truths is important. It is worth knowing that one can easily prevent the death of innocent people for just a few thousand dollars. It's worth knowing that AI poses serious existential risks. That which is true is simply that which corresponds to reality—and knowing something about reality is generally useful. 3 Utilitarianism Kriss next expresses surprise that Rationalists are \"all utilitarians.\" He writes: I've always found this strange. We're supposedly dealing with a group of idiosyncratic weirdos, all of them trying to independently reconstruct the entirety of human knowledge from scratch. Their politics run all the way from the furthest fringes of the far right to the furthest fringes of the liberal centre. Most of them are atheists, but an appreciable portion are not. Meanwhile, formulating a coherent ethics is one of the most difficult problems that exists. You'd expect a lot of intellectual diversity here. But instead, they're all utilitarians.This is another example of, in Kriss-speak, unreality seeping in! Just above 60% of Rationalists are consequentialists of any sort. And of the ones that are consequentialists, a lot aren't utilitarians, and a lot say that consequentialism is the closest to their view but they aren't really consequentialists. Kriss explicitly expresses surprise that more of them are theists than consequentialists, but this is false—only about 4% are theists! So Kriss is quite literally off by an order of magnitude! Though perhaps one cannot help but expect such errors in an essay titled \"against truth.\" As far as I can tell, Kriss's claims can aptly be described as \"pulled out of thin air\" or perhaps pulled out of somewhere else that is less polite but equally accurate. Kriss cites, as a counterexample to utilitarianism, a case involving gladiatorial combat—where one person fights a lion to provide enjoyment to a jeering crowd. If the crowd enjoys it enough, Kriss argues, utilitarianism should support the resulting state of affairs, for it generates more pleasure than pain. Now, I think there are various good utilitarian reasons to oppose such a thing: first of all, the math doesn't actually work out unless the crowd is very large; second, getting joy from watching gladiators fight corrodes the soul; and third, a society permitting such things will inevitably be illiberal and dysfunctional. But putting aside all those pesky factual questions, let's imagine a gladiatorial combat match that would be viewed by 10 quadrillion people who'd each get immense joy from it, in a world with no afterlife, and that the world would end after five minutes, so that their heightened viciousness has no opportunity to corrupt them (or perhaps they're psychologically constituted to not be made more vicious by such viewings). Would I think this is good? Yes. Now, I grant that this is unintuitive. But it's unintuitive because it runs afoul of four different intuitions, which are, in my judgment, all demonstrably wrong (I'll link my explanation of why each of them is wrong next to my explanation of the intuition): The intuition that people have rights that can't be overridden even for very great good. The intuition that lots of small rewards can't add up to be as good as a single very great reward. The intuition that it's bad when vicious people are happy. The intuition that pleasure derived from wickedness is not good for a person. I grant that this result is unintuitive, but I think it's unintuitive because it runs together four different mistaken intuitions into one perverse soup of unintuitiveness. These things must be considered one at a time; when analyzed individually, none of the intuitions holds up. Besides, there are lots of reasons not to trust our direct intuitions about this subject; there's every evolutionary reason for us to hate bad people and wish them to fail and we don't have reliable judgments about big numbers. I also think there are reasons to be methodologically distrustful of the sorts of intuitions Kriss appeals to—more fundamental intuitions about principles are less riddled with bias and emotions than intuitions about cases.But fine, I'll commend Kriss on making a serious argument against utilitarianism. It's not just poetry—it's a real consideration that merits serious thought. It's wrong, but not ridiculous. Kriss then discusses the repugnant conclusion, the judgment that a very large number of people with barely worthwhile lives is better than one with merely 10 billion very happy people. Unfortunately, Kriss seems to botch the details and make it sound like the people have net negative lives—in which case utilitarianism doesn't imply that the scenario is better: The repugnant conclusion invites us to imagine two futures. Future A is a planet of ten million people living in joyful balance with nature, dancing in the woods, discussing Flaubert after dinner. All diseases have been wiped out; people happily accept death as the price of a beautiful life. Future B is a human factory farm of one hundred trillion people, stacked in wire cages that cover the entire surface of a dead Earth. Absolutely everyone is utterly miserable, but thanks to pharmaceuticals in the mossy water that drips from the ceiling of your cage, you are not quite actively suicidal. You might prefer to live in future A. But the repugnant conclusion is that future B is morally preferable, because it contains more overall happiness, even if each individual person only gets a fraction of it.It isn't enough not to be actively suicidal: for utilitarianism to prefer B, total welfare has to be higher in B. Everyone must have a life that is overall worth living. Now, what Kriss neglects to mention—a frustratingly common oversight in repugnant conclusion discussions—is that provably every view will have to say something weird about the repugnant conclusion. This is why even Michael Huemer, a non-utilitarian philosopher, accepts the repugnant conclusion. It's not just some weird result of utilitarianism—it's everyone's problem. Why is this? I'll just discuss one of the many arguments that leads some people to accept the repugnant conclusion. Start with a world with ten billion happy people. Let's say their well-being level is all 10,000. Now let's add another 10 billion happy people with well-being level 8,000—and boost the well-being level of the people with 10,000 units to 11,000 units. Sounds better! Now, let's move everyone's well-being level to 9,999 units. This is better again—total well-being is now higher, average well-being is higher, and well-being is more equally distributed. But now let's add another 20 billion happy people with well-being level of 7,000, and move all the people with well-being level of 9,999 units back to 10,000 units. Seems better once again. Now let's even things out, and move everyone's well-being level to 9,998 units. Once again, this is much better—only a slight hit to anyone's well-being in order to vastly raise the well-being of some people. But this can keep going until everyone is eating muesli and listening to muzak. Or put graphically: This process of improvement can keep continuing until we're at world Z which has lots of just barely happy people. For these reasons, which I've only very briefly began to sketch, I think we should accept the repugnant conclusion. At the very least, I think this shows that there are real and serious reasons to accept the RC. People don't just do it because of some unhealthy psychosexual relationship with numbers. Next Kriss says: We're here because, like most computational systems, utilitarianism has difficulty representing death. Since the dead don't experience either pleasure or pain, on a straightforward reading of the theory painlessly murdering random people is potentially a morally neutral act. No one's suffering, after all. This conflicts with our moral intuitions a little too much, so utilitarians decide that their real measure isn't the pleasure experienced by actually existing people, but the total quantity of happiness in the universe.This is so stupendously wrong that I pray you never show it to a moral philosopher for they might begin bleeding from all their orifices, before keeling over dead. It's true that the dead don't experience pleasure or pain. But utilitarians are in favor of pleasure (note: I think there's more that makes a person's life go well than just pleasure). So killing someone is bad because it makes them lose out on all future well-being. This is, in fact, the most widely accepted account of death's badness among philosophers. As an analogy, suppose that you love black paint in vessels and hate white paint in vessels (the first draft of this contained a typo to say \"suppose that you love black pain in vessels\" which you should not do!). You are attempting to maximize the quantity of black paint minus white paint in vessels. If there are vessels full of black paint, you wouldn't be indifferent because there's no white paint. You'd be disappointed because the destruction of the vessels means you lose out on all the black paint! I think utilitarianism has this weird science-fictional aspect because it is ultimately not an ethics for actual human beings. From Bentham and Mill on, it's always been a programme for the hypothetical hyperintelligent AI god that lives in the future. The moral subject it adresses always has two significant features that this notional computer possesses, but humans lack. The familiar little bundle of infinite knowledge and infinite power.It's true that we're often uncertain about which actions produce the most well-being. But so what? The mere fact that you don't always know what achieves some aim doesn't mean that you shouldn't try to achieve the aim. Most people want their lives to go well, even though they have lots of uncertainty about which things will be best for them long-term. Some utilitarians sincerely want to exterminate all fish, since they live lives of suffering, and all predatory megafauna, since they cause suffering to other animals, as if they could have any earthly idea what the repercussions of this would be. They are already imagining themselves as an all-knowing computer, the one that can determine which desperate struggling little life has value, and which does not.As a Burkean, I'd be against eliminating all fish without pausing to see the long-term effects, but I would be in favor of reducing fish populations. I don't think I'm an all-knowing computer. You don't have to be all-knowing to be pretty confident that creatures, most of whom starve to death after about a week of pitiful existence, don't have good lives. I might be wrong about this. But I don't think I am. And one should act on the basis of their best evidence even if they have some remaining uncertainty. As an analogy: suppose that there was a machine that generated human babies and left them to starve to death after a week. I'd be in favor of shutting off the machine. You would be too! This presumably isn't because you think you're an all-knowing computer, but because you think you don't need to be omniscient to act.Infinite knowledge implies infinite power. You are always the person standing by the lever, and not one of the six people tied to the tracks.???Obviously utilitarians recognize that you don't make the world's decisions. But it's quite sensible not to talk about what you should do in a scenario where you don't make decisions, because by definition, you can't do anything if you're not the one making the decisions. What would it even mean to argue about what you should do if you're one of the six people tied to the tracks: you can't do anything!I'm very glad the world contains people like Matthew Adelstein, who will cheerfully endorse the repugnant conclusion and the torture-dust equilibrium along with every other insane artefact of this system, and tell you you're wrong and anti-moral if you don't agree. I don't want these people to have power, and I would never want to believe in any of this stuff personally, but I think having a broad diversity of utterly insane ideas in common circulation is a good in and of itself.And I'm very glad the world contains Sam Krisses! I'd be even gladder if Sam Kriss actually addressed my arguments for the repugnant conclusion and the torture-dust speck result. Remember, lots of non-utilitarians accept these weird-seeming results. The arguments for them are surprisingly compelling. If you're going to do serious philosophy, you can't just point and sputter at results you don't like, before submerging your sputters in a hideous vortex of prose that grows increasingly untethered from reality, until it eventually sounds like Cormac McCarthy discussing horses reacting to people vomiting (an event McCarthy described thusly): [They] walked off in separate directions through the chaparral to stand spraddlelegged clutching their knees and vomiting. The browsing horses jerked their heads up. It was no sound they'd ever heard before. In the gray twilight those retchings seemed to echo like the calls of some rude provisional species loosed upon that waste. Something imperfect and malformed lodged in the heart of being. A thing smirking deep in the eyes of grace itself like a gorgon in an autumn pool.In much of Kriss's essay, he seems to treat utilitarianism as merely being a subject of idle philosophical speculation. Utilitarianism, in Kriss's mind, is just about how one should treat trolleys and repugnant conclusions, utterly divorced from real-world behavior. But utilitarianism is made of hypothetical examples; it's all edge cases with no centre. Trolley problems, hive planets in the unimaginably far future, torturing one person to death to stop fifty squintillion others from getting that sensation where you think you're about to sneeze but don't actually sneeze. When it comes to the actual ethical quandaries faced by actual people in the actual world, utilitarianism either gives the wrong answer, or has nothing at all to say.But if you look at the things that real-world utilitarians actually do, they're pretty abnormally good. Effective altruism, a movement filled with lots of utilitarians, mostly spends its time giving money to poor kids dying of malaria and preventing animals from being tortured on factory farms. Hundreds of thousands of lives have been saved. Utilitarianism is controversial in holding that all that matters is making the lives of conscious beings go well. But its real-world implications are mostly uncontroversial—simply being that helping others is very important. Divorced from bizarre hypothetical scenarios about repugnant conclusions, world-Z, and gladiators, utilitarianism mostly advises that people give money to prevent terrible things from happening as effectively as possible. But that is something that we should all think! Utilitarians, in the real world, mostly do things that we should all be in favor of. There is a way that Sam Kriss could really own me on this point. If he signs the Giving What We Can pledge to give away 10% of his earnings to effective charities, this would show that you can do all the non-weird and uncontroversially stuff utilitarians do without holding their strange beliefs. I'd be so thoroughly wrecked that I might have to retire. (Others can also own me by taking the pledge—the more people do, the more thoroughly I'd be wrecked). 4 Conclusion Even though I've just finished a long post explaining why Sam Kriss is wrong about everything, I did find Kriss's essay fun to read. Kriss has elsewhere said he's \"not above a good scrap. I like having a worthy opponent.\" I aim to have been adequate in this regard—certainly more adequate than Yarvin, his previous opponent. Hopefully Mr. Kriss, in the event that he reads this, takes the jabs thrown in the playful spirit in which they were offered. In short, while the world is full of fiction and myth, stories and narrative, some things really are true. Many of these truths are important. If you're trying to figure out what's true, you have to carefully consider arguments on both sides. I think the Rationalists come to believe a lot of false things and often fail to seriously consider various arguments for weird sociological reasons. But this is not a reason to abandon the truth-discovering enterprise entirely. Kriss seems to disagree with this. But aside from there being lots of pleasantly-written sentences reiterating his position on the matter, it's not clear quite why. Now, perhaps I've made an error. Kriss's essays exist in the twilight zone between fact and fiction. Perhaps you're not supposed to mine them for propositional content, any more than you would for a Da Vinci painting. But at least I hope to have shown that Kriss has not given people good reasons to abandon utilitarianism or the search for truth. Rationalism is wrong, but not for the reasons Kriss gives, and many of those reasons are only barely coherent! We should seek the good, the true, and the beautiful, and no amount of prose about colloid, close reads of Harry Potter Fan-Fiction, platitudes about the existence of fiction, or regurgitated confusions about utilitarianism changes that.",

      "content": "The central critical question about Rear Window is: what makes it so compelling? For the first part of the film, nothing happens. The murder only happens a quarter of the way into the film, and it is doubted for most of the duration. From the opening frame, behind the credits, we can see people moving around in their apartments, the little motions of ordinary life. The apartment building contains: a newly married couple, two women who sunbathe, a dancer, a lonely middle-aged woman, a conventional family with a young child, an amateur artist, a woman who keeps birds, a song-writer, a couple who sleep on their balcony and own a dog, and a married couple who row. Behind them all, the busy street passes by. Why is such a film compelling from the start? There is no hint that anything like a murder will take place.First, this range of people is a trope in itself, akin to the country house setting of English murders. Each different type; each has their own problems: loneliness, professional struggle, marital stress, and so on. So from the start, as the camera pans through the rear window through which we see all this, we sense, intuitively, that we are watching these people for a reason. Hitchcock introduces them all with intense economy. When he makes his cameo, he is winding a clock, the perfect symbol of his work as director in this slow moving thriller.And he does so with very few words. There are nicknames for them: Miss Torso, Miss Lonelyhearts, and so on. But we don't need them. The images are enough. A silent, solo supper; a throng of unwanted admirers pressing themselves, literally, upon the dancer. So many of the most important and compelling passages of this film pass with no words spoken. When Thorwald first appears, he looks evil; we see it in his darkened eyes, his dipped head, the heavy gait. When he smokes a cigar in the dark, it is confirmed. This is a visual symbol of character. Quilp, the villain of The Old Curiosity Shop, does the same. But it is also a plot point. When the dog dies, only one person does not come to their window—Thorwald's cigar can be seen glowing in the darkness.From the beginning, Hitchcock shows us that we are in a mixed genre—it might be comic, it might be tragic; it might be something, it might be nothing; but somewhere, someone is going to be the victim. This is how a murder story begins. By showing us everyone in their tension with their neighbour—the amateur artist is annoyed by the dancer's noise, the grumpy husband clearly dislikes the amateur artist, the newlyweds keep the blinds drawn, everyone can hear the songwriter's music: all keep to themselves.So we know this is a setting for drama. This is deeply reinforced when our protagonist is a photographer (essential for surveillance) who is wheelchair bound. Another hint is dropped when Thelma Ritter says she can feel there will be trouble with all the \"peeping Tom\" business Jimmy Stewart is doing. In a normal, generic, murder story, or private dick tale, this warning would be given more grimly, more loudly. The whole of Rear Window is a reaction to this genre. What we expect is made small; what we don't expect is put centre frame.When the wife is murdered we hear a small scream, but nothing can be seen. Instead of a panic, a chase, there is silence, the dark hint of something wicked, and the scene ends. When it rains, there is no dramatic thunder. When the husband confronts the wife, we hear nothing, we only see her mocking him. Every part of the traditional murder is made small, as it would be when seen from a window. Hitchcock is playing with the genre, showing us that the conventions can all be ignored and a fresh story told about how we see the world.The window is the frame, and within that, the camera or binoculars. Jimmy Stewart moves from the panorama of his view to the close ups. As a photographer, he frames the world, chooses what to see and when. This is reinforced by the fact that he falls asleep and misses Thorwald leaving his apartment with a woman who could well be his wife. All we have to go on are deep suspicions. Unlike most murder mysteries, there is no body, and, until about two thirds of the way in, perhaps later, there isn't even a guaranteed missing person. Hitchcock shows us enough to let us believe in the murder—but also enough to keep the doubter's tension.It is this that makes the film so compelling from beginning to end: are we seeing all that can be seen; are we seeing it clearly, accurately? Are we framing this mystery correctly? Thus Hitchcock makes a quiet melodrama, which is far more compelling than the lurid standard of his genre. More than once, real doubts are brought in about the whole movie. When the dog dies, his owner cries out to the whole building—all the dog did was love you all, is that why you killed him? Neighbours are supposed to love one another. When the policeman tells Stewart that private lives are almost impossible to understand through a window, we, and Stewart and Grace, feel the force of his argument. Several of the neighbours come close to calamity: a near suicide attempt, a drunken return where the composition is flung away, a dead dog. Miss Lonelyhearts is a lesson to them all that what they think they see is not necessarily what they ought to see. It is not their spying that saves her life, but the songwriter's music. Should they have watched her? Should we be watching them? Isn't it alarming how readily Jimmy Stewart wants to disregard civil liberties to catch his suspect, based on such thin evidence? You must keep watching, the film says; only by sustained, close, all too intimate attention can the truth be found. Look how little expected are the endings of Miss Torso, the composer, and Miss Lonelyhearts—people we keep glancing at, but not intently watching. This is the art of voyeurism. Something Hitchcock well understood, with his obsession for platinum blondes. Indeed, Grace Kelly's hair, like a mass of gold spun into silk, occupies large parts of the frame in several scenes. Should you be watching her? After all, the camera lens and the window are all framed by the screen we're staring at, are they not? When Grace Kelly is caught by Thorwald, we see him reflected in the window glass, just as we have seen so much reflected in Jimmy Stewart's photo lens.Another way Hitchcock resists his genre is the love story. Grace Kelly and Jimmy Stewart are not Sherlock and Watson—they combine the traditional \"merry war\" of comic lovers with the competition between sleuths. It is by becoming the daring Sherlock in her own right that this Beatrice wins her Bededick. It is not just private detective against police, or woman trying to pin down man, but a subtle marriage of the two story lines, making neither as clichéd as they otherwise would be.Rear Window is one of the best movies ever made because it constantly presents all the tropes we expect in a murder story, but never uses them in the conventional manner. It becomes a commentary on the voyeuristic nature of art, which is not a mirror to nature, but the opportunity to spy through windows we would shrink from staring at in real life.",

I'm getting into the bad habit of sending these essays whenever I finish them. Maybe it's a good habit. This one is about an idea I've been thinking about for a while. Over the last few weeks, I've read as much as I could in order to try to put some more rigor around it. The idea is that technology creates means, but that we shouldn't expect it to create meaning. That's up to us. To realize the amazing present and future we want, we need both means and meaning. I want Not Boring to be about both. This is the manifesto.

I didn't do it for a medal. Really, it was nothing. Yeah sure it's like 864 pages of Russian literature or whatever, but Tolstoy is such a magnificent writer it really didn't feel that long. Lots of people have read it. It's no big deal, really.Where was I? Ah, yes.It struck me, towards the end (I'm a little slow), that what the book is about is getting what you want and finding yourself asking, \"Cool, now what?\"I bring this up not to brag – again, lots of people have read Anna Karenina! – but because it's a theme that, mostly unintentionally, I've been playing with in Not Boring over the past few months.It's there in The Return of Magic:The Return of Magic isn't a rejection of reason and science. Reason and science have gotten us here, and we need science to expand. But we must simultaneously rediscover the wonder and intuition that we've forgotten, so that we might see the universe as alive, connected, and full of possibilities.It's there in Long Questions/Short Answers:Actually, fuck answers, the more I think about it. The best questions don't have answers. The point of the question isn't to find an answer. The best questions are organizing principles, magnets, ways of seeing.It's there quite literally in Most Human Wins:In the AI bull case Roon and Elon discuss, when sufficiently smart AI can do anything humans can and more, AI will cure cancer, improve crop yields, and speed up travel.Humans, in our divine discontent, will say, \"Cool, now what?\"Now what? is the fundamental question of the modern era.To be certain, it is an old question. Anna Karenina is not a new book.Before Tolstoy, Aristotle distinguished between \"instrumental goods\" like wealth, tools, and health and \"intrinsic goods\" like virtue, contemplation and friendship. He argued that contemplative life (bios theoretikos) was the highest form of human activity because it was meaningful in itself, and that the active life (bios praktikos) was necessary but subordinate.The Ancient Greeks, however, assumed scarcity. For them, having enough instrumental goods was a prerequisite for philosophical contemplation. Recall Maslow's Hierarchy: humans need their basic needs covered before they can spend time on self-actualization.We, however, live in an age of abundance. And contra Maslow, it doesn't seem to be making us more actualized. We have not filled our lives with meaning and contemplation.It turns out that instead of Maslow's linear progression, there is a complex dynamic relationship between instrumental goods and intrinsic goods, the active life and the contemplative life, or physiological needs and self-actualization.\"Again I tell you,\" preached Jesus, \"it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God.\"More generally, the greater our means, the harder it may be to find meaning.Why? Anna Karenina might suggest a mechanism: there is thrill in striving. Purpose in striving. Even those who have put in decades of work are overcome by a sense of melancholy when they finally achieve their aim.Michael Phelps felt lost and depressed after his 2012 Olympics, perhaps the greatest of all time. Harper Lee barely published after the overwhelming success of To Kill a Mockingbird. J.K. Rowling compared her sense of loss upon completing the Harry Potter series to bereavement. In Losing My Virginity, Richard Branson shared that business successes left him feeling unexpectedly empty.Now what?Now, it is easier than ever to get what we want, or what we think we want, or a simulacrum of something that simulates what we want. Want adoration? Get 1,000 likes on a tweet. Want riches? Build the fastest company ever to reach $100 million in ARR. Want the answer? Ask AI. Want to get skinny? Take Ozempic.Technology's magic is that it can produce means. It lets people do more with less. Technology, however, cannot provide meaning. In fact, the greater our technological powers, the more challenging and urgent our search for meaning becomes.But just because it is harder does not doom it to impossibility. The inverse relationship is not deterministic. Means and meaning were never perfect substitutes.Here, modern philosophers correctly diagnose the problems of modernity but leave a big, pessimistic hole when it comes to solutions.Byung-Chul Han calls ours The Burnout Society. \"The capitalist economy absolutizes survival,\" Han writes. \"It is not concerned with the good life. It is sustained by the illusion that more capital produces more life, which means a greater capacity for living.\"That is not an illusion! It's just incomplete.Capital can support more life, which means a greater capacity for living.My working model for the meaning of life is based on the Perennial Philosophy, that we're all a piece of a universal consciousness, the One knowing itself, and in this model more people having more unique experiences is the point.But simply because capitalism produces more life, which means a greater capacity for living does not guarantee that we are fully utilizing that capacity. That is up to us.And it is hard to argue that we are utilizing that full capacity. We have both greater means and less meaning.This is the great challenge of the modern era, and of all future eras: to shrink the gap between means and meaning as our means continue to grow.Whatever You WishOne of my favorite speculative essays of all-time is Isaac Asimov's Whatever You Wish, which begins:The difficulty in deciding on what the professions of the future would be is that it all depends on the kind of future we choose to have. If we allow our civilization to be destroyed, the only profession of the future will be scrounging for survival, and few till succeed at it.Suppose, though, that we keep our civilization alive and flourishing and, therefore, that technology continues to advance.Asimov's belief, then, is opposed to Han's. A flourishing society means one with technological advancement.In such a future, he imagines, the logical jobs like \"computer programming, lunar mining, fusion engineering, space construction, laser communications, neurophysiology, and so on\" won't actually be necessary. Robots will do all of that for us. So what will we do?Consider that there have been times in history when an aristocracy lived in idleness off the backs of flesh-and-blood machines called slaves or serfs or peasants. When such a situation was combined with a high culture, however, aristocrats used their leisure to become educated in literature, the arts, and philosophy. Such studies were not useful for work, but they occupied the mind, made for interesting conversation and an enjoyable life.These were the liberal arts, arts for free men who didn't have to work with their hands. And these were considered higher and more satisfying than the mechanical arts, which were merely materially useful.Perhaps, then, the future will see a world aristocracy supported by the only slaves that can humanely serve in such a post—sophisticated machines. And there will be an infinitely newer and broader liberal arts program, taught by the teaching machines, from which each person could choose.Asimov was, perhaps, inspired by Aristotle. In The Scent of Time (2017), Han writes:Aristotle distinguished between three kinds of life. A free man may choose between them. The highest form of life is the bios theoretikos, a life dedicated to contemplation. As a free man, the master does not come into direct contact with the resistance exerted by things, as he leaves all work to the slave. This freedom enables him to have an entirely different relationship to the world, one that is not determined by the world as an object of work or domination. The contemplative relationship to things presupposes freedom from work. It interrupts the time that is work. According to Aristotle, the vita contemplativa is divine because it does not suffer any compulsion and is free from any interest.Work is necessary. Humanity needs means to survive. But per both Asimov and Aristotle, if others do the work for us, we are free to live a richer, more divine contemplative life. A life of leisure, as Han describes in his 2023 book, Vita Contemplativa:The activity of the God, 'which surpasses all others in blessedness', is contemplative activity (theoretike),\" The activity of contemplation is an inactivity, a contemplative calmness, leisure (schole) to the extent that, unlike active life (bios politikos), it does not act; that is, it does not have its purpose outside of itself. In its inactivity, its leisure, life relates to itself. Life is no longer estranged from itself. Aristotle therefore associates bios theoretikos with self-sufficiency: 'And the self-sufficiency that is spoken of must belong most to the contemplative activity.' Only vita contemplativa promises divine self-sufficiency and perfect blessedness.This is the leisure of St. Augustine – \"The attraction of a life of leisure ought not to be the prospect of lazy inactivity, but the chance for the investigation and discovery of truth.\" – and to ground it in reality, the leisure the great Indian mathematician Ramanujan sought, not for no purpose, but to dedicate himself to his math:What he wanted, Ramanujan replied, was a pittance on which to live and work. Or, as Ramachandra Rao later put it, \"He wanted leisure, in other words, simple food to be provided to him without exertion on his part, and that he should be allowed to dream on.\"He wanted leisure . . . The word leisure has undergone a shift since the time Ramachandra Rao used it in this context. Today, in phrases like leisure activity or leisure suit, it implies recreation or play. But the word actually goes back to the Middle English leisour, meaning freedom or opportunity. And as the Oxford English Dictionary makes clear, it's freedom not from but \"to do something specified or implied\" [emphasis added]. Thus, E. T. Bell writes of a famous seventeenth-century French mathematician, Pierre de Fermat, that he found in the King's service \"plenty of leisure\"—leisure, that is, for mathematics.So it was with Ramanujan. It was not self-indulgence that fueled his quest for leisure; rather, he sought freedom to employ his gifts. In his Report on Canara, Malabar and Ceded Districts, Thackeray spoke of the \"leisure, independence and high ideals\" that had propelled Britain to its cultural heights. The European \"gentleman of leisure,\" free from the need to earn a livelihood, presumably channeled his time and energy into higher moral and intellectual realms. Ramanujan did not belong to such an aristocracy of birth, but he claimed membership in an aristocracy of the intellect. In seeking \"leisure,\" he sought nothing more than what thousands born to elite status around the world took as their due.It is the type of leisure that Asimov envisioned: that we will all be technologically-enabled Ramanujans, if not in skill then in desire.Won't people choose to do nothing? Sleep their lives away?If that's what they want, why not?—Except that I have a feeling they won't. Doing nothing is hard work, and, it seems to me, would be indulged in only by those who have never had the opportunity to evolve out of themselves something more interesting and, therefore, easier to do.There's this funny quirk in sci-fi where its authors imagined technologies like flying cars, robots, fusion, and AI, but not social media. They pictured us largely being... us, but with better technological capabilities. With more means, and the same meaning.David Foster Wallace, however, saw what was coming. Our relationship with media and technology, and with our ability to pay attention, suffused his work.Infinite Jest featured The Entertainment, a videotape so compelling people just watched it until they died. Something to Do With Paying Attention has everything to do with paying attention. And in a conversation with Rolling Stone's David Lipsky, during a five-day road trip at the end of his Infinite Jest book tour that would become a book, which became a movie, DFW addressed the challenge head-on:DFW: And that as the Internet grows, and as our ability to be linked up, like—I mean, you and I coulda done this through e-mail, and I never woulda had to meet you, and that woulda been easier for me. Right? Like, at a certain point we're gonna have to build up some machinery, inside our guts, to help us deal with this. Because the technology is just gonna get better and better and better and better. And it's gonna get easier and easier, and more and more convenient, and more and more pleasurable, to be alone with images on a screen, given to us by people who do not love us but want our money. Which is all right. In low doses, right? but if that's the basic main staple of your diet, you're gonna die. In a meaningful way, you're going to die.Lipsky: But you developed some defenses?DFW: No. This is the great thing about it, is that probably each generation has different things that force the generation to grow up. Maybe for our grandparents it was World War Two. You know? For us, it's gonna be that at, at a certain point, that we're either gonna have to put away childish things and discipline ourself about how much time do I spend being passively entertained? And how much time do I spend doing stuff that actually isn't all that much fun minute by minute, but that builds certain muscles in me as a grown-up and a human being? And if we don't do that, then (a) as individuals, we're gonna die, and (b) the culture's gonna grind to a halt.Did you skip over the block quote? Don't. Go back and read it. Pay attention.DFW's 1996 prediction must have seemed prescient when The New Inquiry posted it as an excerpt in 2010. It feels downright clairvoyant in 2025.When he said that, in 1996, only 16.4 in every 100 Americans used the internet. Today, 93.1 out of 100 of us do.Internet Users for the United States, FREDIn 1996, when they finally connected to the 'net after waiting dozens of seconds for their 28.8k modems to dial up, those pioneering netizens found websites that looked like this...Apple Website in 1996, Web Design MuseumOr this...Pepsi Website in 1996, Web Design MuseumWhile it might surprise a modern reader that Pepsi's website was so much radder than Apple's, it shouldn't. Back then, PepsiCo was worth $45.6 billion. Apple was worth only $2.6 billion.Today, PepsiCo is worth $184.3 billion, good for a respectable 4x over the period. Apple, meanwhile, has grown its value 1,207x to $3.14 trillion, with a T, thanks in large part to the fact that it has put an internet-superhighway-connected-supercomputer in all of our pockets.According to Business of Apps, 155 million Americans own an iPhone (and most of the rest own Android pocket internet-superhighway-connected-supercomputers). More than 5x more people carry an internet computer with them everywhere they go today than used the internet at all in 1996. We millions connect to the internet at something like 1,000 - 70,000x faster speeds than we did in 1996.And our pocket computers not simply to passively consume entertainment, but to scroll apps that actively consume us.Each of us has our own addiction. Some scroll Instagram. The kids like TikTok. My drug of choice is Twitter.I deleted Twitter from my phone a couple weeks ago. Again, hold your applause. I do this sometimes. I always come back, but right now, I'm pretty pleased with myself. That weekend, I hung out with my family and went to the FIFA World Club Cup Finals and so wasn't at my computer, and therefore not on Twitter. On Monday, when I signed on for the first time in over 24 hours, I was greeted with \"Recent post\" notifications in my feed, which, presumably, if I'd had the app installed and notifications on, would have pinged me, luring me back.Later that day, Elon Musk announced that xAI/X launched Companion Mode in SuperGrok.Companion Mode is AI waifus and AI Chads, animated avatar experiences currently exclusive to iOS users who subscribe to SuperGrok Heavy for $300 a month. Those who fork over 25% more than the per capita Gross National Income of Burundi each month can both speak to the avatar and hear her respond. And watch her respond. The animations sync, creating an immersive, spoken conversation feel. Mike Solana wrote about the implications in Goonpocalypse.The internet is no longer a thing we can choose to distract ourselves with. It is its own organism with its own desires, and chief among those desires is to wrest our attention away from us.DFW was right. The technology got better and better and better and better, and easier and easier, and more and more convenient, and more and more pleasurable, to be alone with images on a screen, given to us by people who do not love us but want our money.Asimov was probably right, too, that we won't sleep our lives away. And, technically, he might have been right that people won't choose to do nothing. He assumed choice. He didn't know about social media, and he didn't know about Companion Mode.Neither did Jean Baudrillard, but he certainly anticipated them.Jean BaudrillardIn 1981, the French philosopher published Simulacra and Simulation, in which he argues that in contemporary society, we live in a world of simulations that have become more real than reality itself, that have irreversibly replaced reality.To give you some sense of his view, the book inspired The Matrix, but Baudrillard himself didn't like The Matrix, because it allowed for the possibility that there was any underlying reality to return to at all.Simulacra & Simulation Easter Egg in The MatrixTo Baudrillard, we've moved so far beyond the original referent that the very concept of an authentic, underlying reality has become meaningless. We live in hyperreality: a world in which Disneyland, television, consumer brands, and media representations actually constitute reality.We photograph meals to craft an image of our lives. Instead of being present at the meal with friends, our mind is in the internet. The Instagram post becomes more real than the meal itself.Within an hour of this week's Blackstone shooting, people (bots?) began tweeting their theories that it was a \"false flag\" operation, because BlackRock was actually founded out of Blackstone and the shooter reportedly yelled, conveniently, \"Free Palestine!\" The shooting became more about the conspiracies than the victims.When the Astronomer CEO was caught on Coldplay camera canoodling with the company's head of HR, the story became the memes. Only the übermeme, Gwenyth Paltrow's Thank You For Your Interest in Astronomer, could resolve the situation. It was never, of course, about the actual people cheating or being cheated on.In each case, the simulation doesn't just represent reality but becomes it. This is what Baudrillard meant by hyperreality.Baudrillard's is not a purely anti-technological position.What set him off in the first place was the May 1968 student and worker uprising in France that nearly brought down de Gaulle's government. Radical on the surface, he was appalled by how quickly and totally it was absorbed and neutralized by the media and consumer system. Its revolutionary symbols were immediately commodified, its radical energy channeled into lifestyle consumption, its political demands transformed into cultural products. Think Ché t-shirts and posters, adorned by would-be revolutionaries who will never revolt. The system didn't need to defeat the revolution by force; it simulated revolution so effectively that real revolution became impossible to distinguish from its media representation.Certainly, though, Baudrillard would not be surprised to see people yelling at and talking dirty to bots. He wrote that there are \"three orders of simulacra\" (simulacra (n): a copy or representation that no longer refers to any original reality but instead becomes a self-contained truth in a hyperreal realm):Simulacra that are natural, naturalist, founded on the image, on imitation and counterfeit, that are harmonious, optimistic, and that aim for the restitution or the ideal institution of nature made in God's image;Simulacra that are productive, productivist, founded on energy, force, its materialization by the machine and in the whole system of production—a Promethean aim of a continuous globalization and expansion, of an indefinite liberation of energy (desire belongs to the utopias related to this order of simulacra);Simulacra of simulation, founded on information, the model, the cybernetic game—total operationality, hyperreality, aim of total control.It is not, he would argue, that we are spending too much time scrolling social media and gooning to AI Companions instead of spending time in the real world, but that social media and AI companions have become the real world, or the hyperreal world. They form our reality.These third-order simulacra are, like Infinite Jest's Entertainment (and there is evidence that DFW both read and taught Baudrillard), so alluring and so devoid of meaning that even as we create the means (second-order simulacra) to give ourselves more time for meaning, we will instead get sucked, inevitably and irreversibly, further and further into the simulation.On our current path, many will take the time afforded to them by the miracles of modern capitalism and fake jobs and sleepwalk through life glued to increasingly alluring screens.Diagnosis Without CureSo what do we do?Modern critical theorists are frustratingly empty here. They identify problems but provide very little in the way of practical solutions.Han is devastatingly good at diagnosis and frustratingly weak on cures. He proposes a return to the vita contemplativa, thinking to think, reflecting on beauty, and the like. It feels like a call to withdraw from society and the economy (especially the economy) in order to contemplate. Ironically, in doing so, he embodies the uselessness of vita contemplativa without vita activa.This is a uselessness Han himself touches on, briefly, almost as if acknowledging the necessity of the vita activa to fend off critique without dwelling on it long enough to taint the purity of the vita contemplativa. He cites Meister Eckhart and quotes Gregory the Great:Be aware: while a good plan for life requires that one moves from the active to the contemplative life, it is often useful if the soul returns from the contemplative to the active life, in such a way that the flame of contemplation which has been lit in the heart passes on all its perfection to activity. Thus, active life must lead us to contemplation, but contemplation must set out from what we inwardly considered and call us back to activity.\"A vita contemplativa without acting is blind,\" Han admits, \"a vita activa without contemplation is empty.\"This is the tension at the heart of The Glass Bead Game, which Herman Hesse began writing in Germany as the Nazis were rising to power and completed during World War II. The book follows Joseph Knecht, a brilliant young man who is recruited to Castalia, a secluded intellectual province dedicated to pure learning and the mysterious Glass Bead Game from which the book gets its title, and rises to become its master, the Magister Ludi.Hesse's Castalians proudly engage in the most useless work possible, the purely theoretical, on purpose, in order to avoid the taint of reality. Similarly, Han proposes contemplation outside of capitalism, because contemplation in the service of productivity is a form of auto-exploitation that defeats its purpose.What Knecht realizes (spoiler alert), but Han fails to, is that pure intellectual contemplation is meaningless without a connection to actual human life and responsibility. As he tells his friend and Castalian colleague, Tegularius:Your love for culture and the products of the mind does you credit. But it happens that cultural creativity is something we cannot participate in quite so fully as some people think.A dialogue of Plato's or a choral movement by Heinrich Isaac — in fact all the things we call a product of the mind or a work of art or objectified spirit — are the outcomes of a struggle for purification and liberation. They are, to use your phrase, escapes from time into timelessness, and in most cases the best such works are those which no longer show any signs of the anguish and effort that preceded them.It is a great good fortune that we have these works, and of course we Castalians live almost entirely by them; the only creativity we have left lies in preserving them. We live permanently in that realm beyond time and conflict embodied in those very works and which we would know nothing of, but for them. And we go even further into the realms of pure mind, or if you prefer, pure abstraction: in our Glass Bead Game we analyze those products of the sages and artists into their components, we derive rules and patterns of form from them, and we operate with these abstractions as though they were building blocks.Of course all this is very fine; no one will contend otherwise. But not everyone can spend his entire life breathing, eating, and drinking nothing but abstractions. History has one great strength over the things a Waldzell tutor feels to be worthy of his interest: it deals with reality. Abstractions are fine, but I think people also have to breathe air and eat bread.In the end, Knecht chooses to leave Castalia and re-engage with the real world. I will leave it to you to read how that turns out.Baudrillard would have laughed at Knecht's naive attempt to take the Red Pill and leave the Castalian Matrix. Both life inside Castalia and life outside, to Baudrillard, would be mere simulacra. When it comes to solutions, the Frenchman makes Han look like a bushy-tailed optimist.He spends the last chapter of Simulacra and Simulation, On Nihilism, making the case that classical nihilism is no longer pessimistic enough.Neo opening the copy of Simulacra & Simulation in which he hides his code to On NihilismNihilism! Nihilism requires that there be truth, meaning, or reality to reject. Baudrillard says that truth, meaning, and reality no longer exist! They, too, have been replaced by simulacra.He ends the book with this uplifting message:There is no hope for meaning. And without a doubt this is a good thing: meaning is mortal. But that on which it has imposed its ephemeral reign, what it hoped to liquidate in order to impose the reign of the Enlightenment, that is, appearances, they, are immortal, invulnerable to the nihilism of meaning or nonmeaning itself.This is where seduction begins.Enjoy the simulation, because it's all we have left.But meaning here has a very specific connotation. It refers to the Enlightenment project of rational interpretation, the idea that phenomena point to deeper truths and systematic representations. Meaning as signification, the entire apparatus of rational analysis that treats the world as a text to be read. It is, to borrow from Iain McGilchrist, left-brain thinking.I think this ending, intentionally or not, points to the way out.Because meaning in the way that we normally use it, and certainly in the way that I'm using it, is almost precisely the opposite of meaning in the Baudrillardian / Enlightenment sense. It is right-brained: not analyzing reality but being moved by it, not understanding our place in the system but experiencing our aliveness within it. It is what makes life feel worthwhile, even magical.Philosopher of technology Albert Borgmann makes a diagnosis similar to Han's and Baudrillard's. His \"device paradigm\" calls out that modern technology transforms everything into optimized, efficient systems that deliver commodified experiences while hiding the underlying reality. But unlike Han and Baudrillard, Borgmann offers a way forward.In Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life, he writes (emphasis mine):As long as we overlook the tightly patterned character of technology and believe that we live in a world of endlessly open and rich opportunities, as long as we ignore the definite ways in which we, acting technologically, have worked out the promise of technology and remain vaguely enthralled by that promise, so long simple things and practices will seem burdensome, confining, and drab. But if we recognize the central vacuity of advanced technology, that emptiness can become the opening for focal things. It works both ways, of course. When we see a focal concern of ours threatened by technology, our sight for the liabilities of mature technology is sharpened.I read this as: if we mistake means for meaning, if we believe that we will find meaning in the next technological breakthrough, we will ignore the things that provide real meaning as boring and antiquated. But if we realize that technology itself cannot provide meaning, then we can focus on the things that can.If we have reached the simulation's end-game, as Baudrillard would almost certainly argue we are with AGI or even its Companion facsimile, and it has not created meaning, then we can put technology in its right place as something that provides means and get on with the hard work of creating our own meaning.We can engage with that existential question: Cool, now what?Something To Do With Paying AttentionNo, seriously, now what?The problem with philosophers like Han and Baudrillard, too, is that they're all analysis and no soul. For the soul, we need writers, people willing to engage with the billions of individual people who make up the systems.And their answer has something to do with paying attention.Something To Do With Paying Attention, a novella hidden within DFW's unfinished The Pale King which he'd considered publishing as a standalone work, is one of my favorite things I've ever read. It's a beautiful onion. You should read it (it's short), and I don't want to spoil it for you, but frankly, I think it would be impossible. A simulacra of DFW will never approach the real thing. My real concern here is that I won't do it justice, because it's both about attention and a meta-commentary on attention, as in, you've got to pay close attention to the book to really get it.Anyway, the book is about a self-described wastoid who we apparently discover in The Pale King is Chris Fogle, aka \"Irrelevant Chris\" and his journey from wastoid to IRS accountant.Irrelevant Chris throws his away for most of his life – \"I tended to realize again that I wasn't even really aware of what was going on, most of the time. Like taking the train instead of actually driving yourself somewhere and having to know where you were and making decisions about where to turn\" – until, at 24, an accidental lecture from a Jesuit accountant, which hits him in just the right spot at just the right time, given the macro and micro circumstances of his life (his accountant father had died in a subway accident; his recent realization, upon hearing \"You're watching As the World Turns,\" \"that whatever a potentially 'lost soul' was, I was one—and it wasn't cool or funny.\") he takes control of his own attention and directs it towards obtaining a career at the Internal Revenue Service.The macro and micro circumstances, plus the Jesuit substitute accounting professor's bearing and speech – \"Gentlemen, prepare to wear the hat. You have wondered, perhaps, why all real accountants wear hats? They are today's cowboys. As you will be. Riding the American range. Riding herd on the unending torrent of financial data. The eddies, cataracts, arranged variations, fractious minutiae. You order the data, shepherd it, direct its flow, lead it where it's needed, in the codified form in which it's apposite. You deal in facts, gentlemen, for which there has been a market since man first crept from the primeval slurry. It is you—tell them that. Who ride, man the walls, define the pie, serve. Gentlemen, you are called to account\" – wake Irrelevant Chris up – George Saunders calls DFW, in a tribute, a \"wake-up artist\" – and fill him with panic, that he's figured it out too late, that he won't be able to pay for more college, particularly now that his father can't pay for it, now that he finally actually wants to stay in college, so he can complete all of the courses that he needs to complete, and actually learn all that he needs to learn, for a career in the IRS, which he was drawn to as one of a common type of person who are \"almost a special kind of psychological type, probably. It's not a very common type—perhaps one in 10,000—but the thing is that the sort of person of this type who decides that he wants to enter the Service really, really wants to and becomes very determined, and will be hard to put off once he's focused in on his real vocation and begun to be actively drawn to it,\" but now that he's focused on this real vocation, now that he's started paying attention, the solution to his financial situation wrt college payments finds him.Maybe he heard about the IRS' aggressive recruiting drive on WBBM-AM, but he also has a \"partial memory of actually first seeing an advertisement for this recruitment program in a sudden, dramatic way that now, in retrospect, seems so heavily fateful and dramatic that perhaps it is more the memory of a dream or fantasy I had at the time.\"\"Anyhow, according to this memory,\" (I love this, according to this memory, which those four words make seem like not quite his, or certainly not in his control, but which he faithfully reproduces anyway), \"I was sitting at one of the many stylized plastic tables in the Galaxy Mall's food court, looking absently down at the table's pattern of star-and-moon shaped perforations, and saw, through one such perforation, a portion of the Sun-Times that someone had evidently discarded on the floor beneath the table, which was open to the Business Classified section, and in the memory involves seeing this from above the table in such a way that a beam of light from the food court's overhead lighting far above fell through one of the star- shaped perforations in the tabletop and illuminated—as if by symbolically star-shaped spotlight or ray of light—one particular advertisement among all the page's other ads and notices of business and career opportunities, this being a notice about the IRS's [note: I'm realizing I used IRS' earlier] new recruitment-incentive program under way in some sections of the country, of which the Chicagoland area was one.\"To me, this sounds like a synchronicity – \"a meaningful coincidence that suggests an underlying pattern or connection beyond normal causality,\" first coined by Jung – but Irrelevant Chris calls it \"another illustration of how motivationally 'primed' I seemed to be, in retrospect, for a career in the service.\"Synchronicity or motivationally primed, it is the type of thing that you can only notice if you're paying attention, which is pretty much the point of the novella.I'm not sure if he did this on purpose, although I'm sure he did because it was DFW, these revelations make you realize that you, the reader, weren't really paying attention, either. That although Chris was a self-described wastoid, although he seemed to be much more like his account father, who was always \"squeezing his shoes,\" than his mother, who was always defending him, he was actually more like his father, deep down in his genes, than either of them would have admitted; he was destined to become an accountant, once he started paying attention.Right there, on page 11, in what seems to be just another example of his waistoidness and his mother's sticking up for him despite or because of that, Chris recounts \"the past trouble I'd had with reading in primary school when we'd lived in Rockford and my father had worked for the City of Rockford. This was in the mid-1960s, at Machesney Elementary. I went through a sudden period where I couldn't read. I mean that I actually couldn't read—my mother knew I could read from when we'd read children's books together. But for almost two years at Machesney, instead of reading something I'd count the words in it [emphasis mine, with the benefit of hindsight], as though reading was just the same as counting the words. For example, 'Here came Old Yeller, to save me from the hogs' would equate to ten words which I would count off from one to ten instead of its being a sentence that made you love Old Yeller in the book even more.\"This accountant's tic shows up throughout the novella; he learns to read again, but he's always counting at the same time. \"For instance,\" he says on the next page, \"I've said 2,752 words right now since I started,\" adding, with an accountant's precision, \"Meaning 2,752 words before I said, 'I've said,' versus 2,754 if you count 'I've said' — which I do, still.\" Later, during the Jesuit substitute accounting professor's rousing ode to accountants, he admits, \"It suddenly occurred to me that I had no idea how many words he'd spoken since that 8,206th one at the conclusion of the review.\" It took a speech on accounting to command his full attention, which had always been at least partially divided by word counting. Later still, however, in the IRS recruiting office, he's counting again: \"Overall, despite comprising scarcely more than 5,750 total words, the initial recruiting presentation lasted almost three hours...\" Attention is something that needs to be constantly directed.There's this one spot next to which I scribbled \"so good\" in the margin, mid-Jesuit substitute accounting's speech, when he wrote/Chris said, \"However transfixed I still was, I was also aware [aware], by this point, that the substitute's metaphors seemed to be getting a bit jumbled—it was hard to imagine the remaining orientals making much sense of cowboys and pies, since they were specifically American images.\" Now that I write it, though, even that speaks to awareness. He'd become, during the speech, so aware as to not get fully swept up in its emotions. Like an accountant might avoid getting swept up in emotions, I guess.The speech's impact on him, which like the newspaper classified seemed directed right at him, was itself a payoff on a long trademark DFW digression a few pages earlier, in which he pokes holes in his Chrisitan roommate's born-again Christian girlfriend's story of being saved, when, lost and hopeless – \"Fervent Christians are always remembering themselves as—and thus, by extension, judging everyone else outside their sect to be—lost and hopeless and just barely clinging to any kind of interior sense of value or reason to go on living, before they were 'saved'\" – \"driving around in one of her parents' AMC Pacer, until, for no particular reason she was aware of inside herself, she turned suddenly into the parking lot of what turned out to be an evangelical Church\" [fuckkk no way. is this a callback to / refutation of his earlier point that driving and turning requires awareness unlike riding a train? it couldn't be... unless...] \"which by coincidence happened to be right in the middle of holding an evangelical service, and—for what she again claimed was no discernible reason or motive she could have named—she wandered aimlessly in and sat down in the rear of the church in one of the plushly cushioned theater-type seats their churches tend to use instead of wooden pews, and just as she sat down, the preacher or father or whatever they called them there evidently said, 'There is someone out there with us in the congregation today that is feeling lost and hopeless and at the end of their rope and needs to know that Jesus loves them very, very much,' and then—in the social room, recounting her story—the girlfriend testified as to how she had been stunned and deeply moved, and said she had instantly felt a huge, dramatic spiritual change deep inside of her in which she said she felt completely reassured and unconditionally known and loved, and as though now suddenly her life had meaning and direction to it after all, and so on and so forth, and that furthermore she had not known a down or empty moment since, not since the pastor or father or whatever picked just that moment to reach out past all the other evangelical Christians sitting there fanning themselves with complimentary fans with slick full-color ads for the church on them and to just kind of verbally nudge them aside out of the way and somehow address himself directly to the girlfriend and her circumstances at just that moment of spiritual need,\" which of course annoyed Irrelevant Chris at the time, and after hearing which he asked her \"just what exactly had made her think the evangelical pastor was talking to her directly, meaning her in particular, as probably everyone else sitting there in the church audience probably felt the same way she did, as pretty much every red-blooded American in today's (then) late-Vietnam and Watergate era felt desolate and disillusioned and unmotivated and directionless and lost, and that that if the preacher or father's [note: he drops 'or whatever' for this one] saying 'Someone lost and hopeless' was tantamount to those Sun-Times horoscopes that are specially designed to be so universally obvious that they always give their horoscope readers that special eerie feeling of particularity and insight, exploiting the psychological fact that most people are narcissistic and prone to the illusion that they and their problems are uniquely special and that if they're feeling a certain way they're surely the only person who is feeling like that. In other words, I was only pretending to ask her a question—I was actually giving the girlfriend a condescending little lecture on people's narcissism and the illusion of uniqueness, like the fat industrialist in Dickens or Ragged Dick who leans back from a great dinner with his fingers laced over his huge stomach and cannot imagine how anyone in that moment could be hungry anywhere in the whole world,\" but which then of course Chris has almost the exact same experience, priest and all, with the Jesuit substitute accounting teacher.It's less a story of uniqueness, he realizes, and more a story of awareness, or the awareness that unique circumstances create which in turn makes the message unique to the receiver even if they can be equally unique to other receivers. Or as he says, \"Anyhow, it seems like a very long time ago. But the point of even remembering the conversation, I think, is that there was an important fact behind the Christian girl's 'salvation' story which I simply hadn't understood at the time—and, to be honest, I don't think she or the Christian did, either. It's true that her story was stupid and dishonest, but that doesn't mean the experience she had in the church that day didn't happen, or that its effect on her wasn't real. I'm not putting it very well, but I was both right and wrong about her little story. I think the truth is probably that enormous, sudden, dramatic, unexpected, life-changing experiences are not translatable or explainable to anyone else, and this is because they really are unique and particular—though not unique in the way the Christian girl believed. This is because their power isn't just the result of the experience itself, but also of the circumstances in which it hits you, of everything in your previous life-experience which has led up to it and made you exactly who and what you are when the experience hits you. Does that make any sense? It's hard to explain. What the girl with the meadow on her boots had left out of the story was why she was feeling so especially desolate and lost right then, and thus why she was so psychologically 'primed' to hear the pastor's general, anonymous comment in that personal way.\"All of which seems like a non-sequitur at the time of reading, but which pays off when Chris absentmindedly walks into the wrong building's room 311 and wonders whether it \"might not have been one more bit of unconscious irresponsibility on my part.\"\"You cannot analyze sudden, dramatic experiences like this this way, though—especially in hindsight, which is notoriously tricky (though I obviously did not understand this during the exchange with the Christian girl in the boots).\"What matters isn't the specific words or experiences. Each person can hear them or experience them in totally unique ways. What matters is how you, in that moment, in the midst of a lifetime of words and experiences, hear or experience them, which just has something to do with paying attention.Attention is All You NeedMy takeaway from Something To Do With Paying Attention is that the exact same situation can provide completely different meaning to different people depending on whether and how each is paying attention.This is the death of meaning in the Enlightenment / Baudrillardian sense. There is no way to run a scientific experiment that determines who will respond to what how.This is the birth of meaning in the sense that we're talking about.Take running. In Simulation and Simulacra, Baudrillard decries it as a Disneyland-like simulacra: \"They no longer walk, but they go jogging, etc.\" Borgmann, on the other hand, includes running as an example of a focal practice: a sustained and engaging human activity that orients life by fostering competence, excellence, and a way of life that shelters meaningful focal concerns through regular and mindful participation:The great run, where one exults in the strength of one's body, in the ease and the length of the stride, where nature speaks powerfully in the hills, the wind, the heat, where one takes endurance to the breaking point, and where one is finally engulfed by the good will of the spectators and the fellow runners.Same activity, two very different ways of paying attention to it. Crucially, how you look at running, how you pay attention to it, shapes how you relate to the world in that moment. If you view it as a vapid simulacrum of walking, you will find yourself overwhelmed by the sheer stupidity of it all every time you chance upon someone out for a jog. If you view it as a way for a human to focus his mind and body against a hard task, you will find yourself impressed by human capacity each time you watch a runner zip by. The experience is more impactful, of course, if you're the one running.This is a little thing, but I think that meaning consists of the way you pay attention to millions or billions of little things.And I think that one of the reasons that with more means, we seem to find less meaning, is that means give you permission to pay less attention.In The World Beyond Your Head, Matthew Crawford compares the old Mickey Mouse cartoons to the more modern Mickey Mouse Clubhouse:In the old Mickey Mouse cartoons from the early and middle decades of the twentieth century, by far the most prominent source of hilarity is the capacity of material stuff to generate frustration, or rather demonic violence. Fold-down beds, ironing boards, waves at the beach, trailers (especially when Goofy is at the wheel of the towing vehicle, on a twisty mountain road), anything electric, anything elastic, anything that can become a projectile. Anything that can suffer termite damage that remains hidden until the crucial moment. Springs are especially treacherous, as are retractable blinds. Snowballs can be counted on to grow by a couple orders of magnitude on their way down the slope toward your head. At any given moment, the odds of being seized by the collar by a severely overwound grandfather clock are nontrivial. Icicles: don't stand anywhere near them. Bicycles tend to become unicycles, unpredictably, and rubber cement is easily mistaken for baking powder. Why do they have nearly identical labels?Old Mickey Mouse Crashing a Car\"Those early cartoons,\" Crawford writes, \"present a rich phenomenology of what it is like to be an embodied agent in a world of artifacts and inexorable physical laws.\" Then there's today's Mickey Mouse Clubhouse:There are four problems per episode, and each can be solved using one of the four tools [offered by the Handy Dandy machine when a character says \"Oh Tootles!\"]. This assurance is baked into the initial setup of the episode; no moment of helplessness is allowed to arise. There is never an insoluble problem, that is, a deep conflict between the will and the world. I suspect that is one reason these episodes are not just unfunny, but somehow the opposite of funny......To be a Mouseke-doer is to abstract from material reality as depicted in those early Disney cartoons, where we see the flip side of affordances. Perhaps we should call unwanted projectiles, demonic springs, and all such hazards \"negative affordances.\" The thing is, you can't have the positive without the negative; they are two sides of the same coin. The world in which we acquire skill as embodied agents is precisely that world in which we are subject to the heteronomy of things; the hazards of material reality. To pursue the fantasy of escaping heteronomy through abstraction is to give up on skill, and therefore to substitute technology-as-magic for the possibility of real agency.This is, of course, just a kid's show, but Crawford's point is that one, this is what we're raising our kids to expect, and two, actual technology promises this, too: \"As we 'build a smarter planet' (as the IBM advertisements say), the world will become as frictionless as thought itself; 'smartness will subdue dumb nature. But perhaps even thinking will become unnecessary: a fully smart technology should be able to leap in and anticipate our will, using algorithms that discover the person revealed by our previous behavior.\"Crawford published the book in 2016. He anticipated by nine years the advertisements for any number of AI agents that promise to anticipate and do everything for us so that we can... what, exactly?Which is fine, sometimes great even, except that, as Crawford argues, the more we expect technology to do things for us, the less we pay attention. He points to Mercedes' driver assist features and the inconvenient fact that roads designed to be safe are home to more accidents. \"Emily Anthes writes that among traffic engineers\":In the last decade or so, a few iconoclasts have begun making roads more hazardous—narrowing them, reducing visibility, and removing curbs, center lines, guardrails, and even traffic signs and signals. These roads, research shows, are home to significantly fewer crashes and traffic fatalities.Mickey Mouse and roads are extreme examples. The roads have clear consequences and measurable statistics. But I think that our ability to engage in almost everything with less attention has an equally significant, if less measurable, impact on our felt sense of meaning.If your phone holds a world of entertainment an arm's length away, why engage in conversation? If ChatGPT reveals all of the answers at the tap of a few keys, why think? Better yet, if it can do that annoying work your boss assigned you, why do it?With each reach for the convenient – each engagement with Baudrillard's third order simulacra – we give away a little bit of our attention, and a little bit of our agency.And sometimes, that is a fine trade to make! Even Han and Baudrillard would agree that there are many things we do that are not worthy of our time, attention, or agency. While Han and Baudrillard would disagree, Borgmann and Crawford, I think, would agree that using technology as a tool can help us move past things that aren't really worth doing to focus on the things that are. People have annoying responsibilities. Removing yourself from the system is impractical and undesirable.The question, then, is what you choose to pay attention to instead.Because now we have cars that not only assist us, but drive us. I was in San Francisco last week and I took half a dozen Waymo rides. I love it. And the stats suggest self-driving cars really are safer. But instead of driving, do you scroll Twitter or TikTok? Or do you meditate, think, call your parents, or simply take in the neighborhoods as you drive through?Twitter and TikTok often win. Twitter wins for me too often, which is why I have to delete it.\"Odell [Jenny, author of How to Do Nothing] believes that periodically stepping away is a temporary, not permanent break from reality: a sort of mental reset that reminds us what our lives are really for. But this reminds me of the social media addicts who cycle through deleting and re-installing apps on their phone,\" Nadia Asparouhova writes, not at me specifically but at me, in Antimemetics, \"Instead of learning to cultivate a fluid sense of control in the world they've been given.\"Nadia explains that she's unsatisfied by Odell's calls to \"extricate ourselves from this system\" as \"a means of reclaiming our attention, but in a way that seems disconnected from our responsibilities to the network.\"Here, she may as well be writing a response to Han: the answer is not to steal away to a contemplative life, but to engage with the world in order to make it one we want to live in.In Antimemetics, and in a conversation with Jackson Dahl on Dialectic, Nadia provides the best argument for engaged attention this side of DFW. In both, she reframes attention from a thing that we must fight to protect from forces beyond our control to a magical power that we can wield.Nadia writes (emphasis mine):Attention is not something we merely own; it is what we are. Learning to wield it isn't just about returning to the \"present moment,\" but rather about creating infinite, dazzling realities – because what we choose to see in the present moment is unique to each of us.I want to talk about us as magical wizards of attention, capable of waving a wand and transforming our worlds in astonishing ways. That seems a lot more fun to me than playing slots at the casino.The world, after all, is more than just what we inherit. It's what we choose to notice, nurture, and build. Everything around us – for worse, yes, but also for the better – is made up of where we direct our attention. If we learn to channel it wisely, we can decide what type of future we want to see.Closing the GapTwo popular, opposing beliefs dominate the modern narrative around technology.One argues that we are the victims of a heartless system - call it capitalism, neoliberalism, technology, or whatever the boogeyman of the day is – and that the best we can do, if we can do anything at all, is to retreat. This belief is deeply pessimistic; it paints individuals as impotent cogs in a heartless machine. It offers diagnoses, often accurate ones, but no solutions.The other argues that technology will solve all of our problems. This falls short, too. While I am a capitalist and a techno-optimist, I believe that the best technology can do is provide means. It can help us live longer, healthier lives, see more of the world and eventually the universe, and free us from dull, repetitive work so that we can do whatever we wish.Contra Han and Baudrillard, I believe that more means, while potentially making it harder to find meaning, are inherently good.Ramanujan died of Tuberculosis, after spells in dreary, moldy English sanitoriums. The onset may have been caused by his inability to get Vitamin D, far as he, a vegetarian, was from South Indian food and South Indian sun. At the time, milk was not yet enriched with Vitamin D. His wife's letters barely reached him. Communication with home was slow and inconsistent. When he finally arrived back in India, he was sick, shriveled, and angry. Then he died, at just thirty-two. With another half-century of leisure, who knows what he would have given the world?It is an illusion, Han says, \"That more capital produces more life, which means a greater capacity for living.\" Count me in the camp who would prefer more life, more years for more Ramanujans, so that we might figure out how to do more living. Life doesn't necessarily equal aliveness, but death guarantees its absence. Baudrillard's contention that we are already dead, or whatever, is cute wordplay that fails in the face of lived experience.DFW, too, predicted the possibility that, if we kept letting ourselves be passively entertained instead of making hard choices minute-by-minute, \"then (a) as individuals, we're gonna die, and (b) the culture's gonna grind to a halt.\" But he left open an if, a choice.While his technological prognostications have proven prescient, we are not dead yet. I am writing this. You are reading it. We are alive.By arguing that, that self-evidence to the contrary, we are already dead, Baudrillard falls into the same trap of which he accuses society: analysis at the expense of the real.To me, his analysis, and Han's, smacks not of the end of the world, but of late stage materialism, of the last gasps of the belief that what's real comes from matter, that consciousness is a weak and secondary thing.But consciousness is the thing. Attention is what we are.Meaning isn't found in things. It never has been, and never will be. We create it through attention.A newspaper under a mall food court table is garbage to most people, destiny to one.A preacher's sermon is blandly meaningless to most people, deeply meaningful to one.Both Irrelevant Chris and the Christian Girlfriend stayed alive long enough to find the thing that brought them meaning. Neither had to farm every day for their food; both had the leisure, however small, to put themselves in meaning's path.This is the great challenge of the modern era, and of all future eras: to shrink the gap between means and meaning as our means continue to grow.There will be depressed people on Mars. Others will take supersonic planes halfway around the world for an Instagram photo. Others still will be cured of cancer only to continue an unhappy life for an extra two or three decades. When the machines provide every human with the opportunity to choose what to do, some will choose to do nothing, to sleep their lives away. Humans are \"divinely discontent.\"We will always ask, \"Cool, now what?\"But it is far better to have the opportunity to grow our sense of meaning to match our means than to shrink it to the limits of limited means. Han and Baudrillard romanticize what was in reality a brutish past by failing to consider the individuals.You could imagine a simple formula for total meaning.Total Meaning = Number of Human Hours * % of Hours Spent MeaningfullyTechnology will increase the number of human hours (assuming Elon's Companions and their third order simulacra siblings don't accelerate the population decline that he warns about). More people will be able to live longer lives. The question is whether we spend those hours more or less meaningfully, whether we spend them as the burnt-out, auto-exploiting automatons Han and Baudrillard view us as, or whether we choose to pay attention.Attention is a more tractable problem than meaning, which is vague and personal, and my hypothesis is that directing the former increases the latter.So it is up to us, to you specifically, for yourself, to to build up some machinery, inside our guts, to help us deal with this. It is up to you to be the wizard of your own attention.How?I think it starts with Nadia's reframing. As she told Jackson on Dialectic:This is where I really want to drive home that when we talk about the buying and selling of attention online, it's often framed as, \"This person owns my attention now\" or \"This person will own my attention.\" But you can own your own attention. You can also do cool things with it and make crazy experiences.She talks about her experience doing the jhanas, which helped her realize that, \"If you don't want to feel a certain way about something, you can actually just not feel that way if you want to. You can move around the little levers in your mind. Attention is crazy.\" Stuck in traffic or at the DMV, she'll ask herself, \"How can I make this the most joyous moment possible?\" Doing that moves an hour from the negative to the positive in our \"% of hours spent meaningfully\" variable.Personally, I've been doing little things, although I'm not perfect.I didn't only delete my Twitter app, I replaced the doomscroll impulse with an impulse to read. I would not have read Han, Baudrillard, Crawford, Borgmann, DFW, and others over the past few weeks if I hadn't. Engaging deeply with this idea that's been floating in my brain has felt meaningful. Instead of asking Claude for an answer, I ask it for a book recommendation.On weekend mornings, I take my kids to get croissants and go to the playground. Last weekend, on a particularly sunny morning, I caught myself just staring at the sun hitting the leaves.I meditate at least twenty minutes a day, if only to get myself in the focusing mood.After getting too locked into the COVID-mode of Zooming whenever possible, I got a small office in the city and try to meet with people in-person whenever possible, ideally for a long walking meeting with no set end time.In everything I do, I'm trying to do fewer, better. This is my first essay in three weeks.I used to listen to something whenever I was on the move. Now I try to walk without headphones. I try to notice the people I walk past, or the way that light hits a building. It's delightful.And I've started noticing little synchronicities, nothing as life-changing as Irrelevant Chris or the Christian Girlfriend experienced, but little things that make the world feel a little more magical.None of this means that I am now a glowing, meaning-filled ball of pure aura. I'm a little tired right now, actually, as I write this. It's hot outside, and my legs got sticky and sweaty in my pants on the walk in, which felt gross. As soon as I hit send on this essay, I'm going to be maniacally checking both the views and the twitter likes.But I do feel happier, even if my circumstances haven't changed much. I love my family, and love that I get to spend time with them every day. Investing in and writing about complex, ambitious businesses that are creating the means with which people have the potential to live better lives feels like exactly what I am supposed to be doing. I get to write this long, philosophical essay in what is ostensibly a tech blog for work. Some of you might even still be reading it.None of this requires me to drop out of the capitalist system and shun technology. I only get to do all of this because of the capitalist system and technology. If anything, I've only gotten more competitive and ambitious since I started paying closer attention. If this is what I'm here to do, I want to do it as well as I possibly can.Any critique of modern society that blames a faceless system and shrugs its shoulders is, if interesting, useless.The beauty of the system that Han and Baudrillard dismiss is that it creates markets for solutions. Individual attention faces weapons-grade distractions, and will demand industrial-grade support. My model here is climate change: turning off your AC doesn't solve the problem, solar, nuclear, and batteries are.I suspect that there is an opportunity for something similar here, even if it doesn't look like \"technology\" as we currently define it. It's not surprising, for example, that religion is making a comeback, and I would love to see more funding for consciousness and non-materialist research. As Nikola Tesla said, \"The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.\" Understanding and expanding our wizard powers is so much more interesting to me than making simulacra of our brains.What I am after is the growth of both means and meaning. Not Boring started as a newsletter about technology businesses, but the main question is: how do we make being a human more amazing?Technology is part of the answer, but it's not the whole answer. That's why, as you may have noticed, I've gotten a little more philosophical and even mystical over the past year or so.It feels more urgent now. AI is the final boss of technologies that Baudrillard, Asimov, Crawford, and DFW warned us about. We can either use it to create space to become more human or to turn our agency and attention over to the machines. It can become a second-order or third-order simulacrum.AI will neither kill us nor save us. Technology will neither kill us nor save us. The system will neither kill us nor save us. What happens next is up to us.So bring on the flying cars and the self-driving ones. Bring on atomic energy, both fission and fusion. Bring on the drones and supersonic planes. Bring on the factories that build houses and the cloud seeders that make it rain. Bring on the robots that do the things we don't want to so we can do whatever we wish.Bring on the means. We will bring the meaning.This is the greatest challenge of our era, and our greatest opportunity.That's all for today. We'll be back in your inbox on Friday with a Weekly Dose.

      "content": "For the past week, I've been reading a set of stories, written by Robert E. Howard in the early 1930s, about a tall, brawny, sword-wielding adventurer named Conan.These stories take place in a fantasy world that resembles the early Iron Age, and in these tales, Conan is sometimes a thief, sometimes a war-leader, sometimes a King, sometimes a pirate, but he is always a simple guy who doesn't care for civilized ways, and who tends to get into a lot of conflict with the assorted nobles, wizards, merchants, and other rich, settled people amongst whom he finds himself.These Conan stories were originally published in a pulp fiction journal called Weird Tales that specialized in fantasy, science fiction, and horror stories. And the most interesting thing about Weird Tales, and about pulp fiction in general, was that it was a niche product. In the larger fiction journals, like The Saturday Evening Post, there were stories for men, women, boys, girls—the whole family. That wasn't true with Weird Tales. It was a journal targeted to young men and boys. And it was a journal with a relatively small circulation, by 1930s standards, which struggled financially and often had difficulty paying its writers.Nonetheless, we still read Conan today because he resonated very strongly with this niche of readers. These readers, some of them, built a part of their identity around liking these stories, and they fought for decades to republish these stories and to give them some broader critical attention. I have to say, having now read a number of Conan stories, I also feel a desire to explain how and why they're good. Because on the surface, these stories are not good. That's because the writing is quite overwrought and full of cliches. For instance, here's a description of Belit, the Pirate Queen:She was slender, yet formed like a goddess: at once lithe and voluptuous. Her only garment was a broad silken girdle. Her white ivory limbs and the ivory globes of her breasts drove a beat of fierce passion through the Cimmerian's pulse, even in the panting fury of battle. Her rich black hair, black as a Stygian night, fell in rippling burnished clusters down her supple back. Her dark eyes burned on the Cimmerian.This passage is a typical example of how these stories write about women. Usually at the first introduction of a woman, there's a long passage where the narrator tries to convey that she is extremely hot. The narration generally takes this world, and this life, extremely seriously, and will often break out into a long description of how awesome and cool Conan is.War was his trade. Life was a continual battle, or series of battles; since his birth Death had been a constant companion. It stalked horrifically at his side; stood at his shoulder beside the gaming-tables; its bony fingers rattled the wine-cups. It loomed above him, a hooded and monstrous shadow, when he lay down to sleep. He minded its presence no more than a king minds the presence of his cup-bearer. Some day its bony grasp would close; that was all. It was enough that he lived through the present.If you were submitting stories to a science-fiction or fantasy journal today, in 2025, and you turned in a story written this way, it would get rejected, because amongst fans of contemporary sci-fi short stories, this sort of writing is a source of derision.Nonetheless, I have to say...I enjoyed reading Conan. I even enjoyed reading these passages. The very passages you've just read—they are the passages I clipped out as being unusually good! Because these are the most Conan-like passages I came across, and the whole reason to read Conan is for passages like these.Nor am I alone in enjoying Conan. He is beloved by a surprisingly large number of people! When I wrote about him on Substack Notes, I got tons of people saying they love Conan too. And all of us have this same confusing desire to try and explain how it is possible for him to be good.The world that created ConanAs I mentioned earlier, Weird Tales was one of the first magazines to specialize in stories of fantasy and horror and science fiction. These kinds of stories had existed for a long time, since Edgar Allan Poe, and they were a mainstay of several other adventure-story magazines like All-Story. But Weird Tales was founded in 1922 as a journal that would exclusively publish these kinds of fantastic, horrifying stories.During the 1920s and 1930s, there were three types of fiction magazines:1The slicks published on slick, glossy paper. Examples are The Saturday Evening Post, Redbook, Collier's, McCall's.The highbrow journals used to publish on book paper, a high-quality matte paper like what you'd find in books. Examples are Scribner's, Harper's, The Atlantic.And the pulps published on cheaper pulp paper. Examples are Weird Tales, Adventure, Black Mask.It is not a simple matter to distinguish these journals. For one thing, there were a number of writers, like Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, who wrote for all three of these categories. For another, at least one of these categories—the slicks—was extremely heterogenous in terms of what it published: the slicks published adventure stories, and they published highbrow authors, and they also published their own category of middle-brow short story (which I'll describe in another post) that was unique to these journals.Generally speaking, the slicks had higher circulations, in the one to two million range. They also had more colorful covers, more complex layouts. The highbrow journals had often had simpler covers, fewer advertisements, simpler layouts, and circulations under 150k.2The pulps were the most marginal of these categoriesPulp journals were cheaper to produce—they were printed on cheaper paper and paid their contributors less—which is probably what enabled publishers to put out niche, special-interest journals like Weird Tales. It was rare for a pulp journal to have a circulation above 200k, and many of them (including some of the most iconic) had circulations that were far less. When it came to the pulps, the tendency was towards an increasing variety and proliferation of titles. At the beginning of the century, you had high-circulation adventure journals like Argosy, which had 500,000 readers, but as time passed, more and more pulps were created, and they often had very specific niches. For instance, there was a whole category of sports pulps, which only had sports stories. And even within that category, there would be pulps that were solely about a single sport: Fight Stories only had boxing stories, for instance. In the 1930s, there were around two hundred pulp fiction journals, most of them publishing monthly (though weekly pulps also existed).The pulps are in some ways the most difficult of these categories to understand, because there were so many, and there was no journal that dominated the rest, the way The Saturday Evening Post came to dominate the slicks, or The New Yorker came to dominate the highbrow journals. Although combined sales of the pulp fiction journals probably equaled those of the slicks, the sheer number of titles meant that any given pulp usually had a relatively small readership. From 1922 until it ceased publication in 1954, Weird Tales rarely exceeded a circulation of 50k (whereas in 1930 the The Atlantic had 150k in circulation and or The Saturday Evening Post reached two million). Weird Tales tended to pay Howard somewhere between $70 and $130 per story—only a fraction of the $300 to $500 that The New Yorker paid, to say nothing of the $3000 to $5000 an author could get from The Saturday Evening Post.Writing for the slicks and highbrow journals not only paid more, it also offered a longer-lasting career. The highest-regarded writers for the slicks and highbrow journals often won awards, were reprinted in Best American Short Stories, were reviewed in major periodicals, and saw their works collected into books that sometimes became bestsellers in their own right. In contrast, this treatment was rarer for pulp writers—its not that pulp fiction authors didn't come out with books, they definitely did, but they generally had a harder time getting publishers interested, especially if they were writing science fiction or fantasy. With Conan, the stories never appeared in book form until the 1950s, long after the author's death. Physically speaking, the slicks and highbrow journals were designed to last—it was not uncommon for families to bind these journals into yearly-volumes and keep them in numbered sets in a bookshelf—while the pulp journals were inherently disposable. They were like newspapers. You read them, you got rid of them. So not only could you only read the Conan journal in the original publication, but even that original publication was inherently disposable and not designed to last.This general disposability meant that writers like Robert E. Howard were simply never mentioned in mainstream literary periodicals, not even sneeringly, and had essentially no literary footprint. If you were reading the archives of the major literary periodicals of the day, you might not even know such a thing as Weird Tales existed, much less run across the name Robert E. Howard.As a cultural phenomenon, the pulps also had the shortest run. By the 1950s, the pulp era was largely over, replaced by comic books. It took until the late 1990s for the slicks to lose their cultural relevance, and the highbrow journals continue publication to this day.My understanding is that these covers were painted by a woman, Margaret Brundage. / Source: Internet ArchiveThe pulps gave rise to fan cultureHowever, the pulps have one advantage over these other categories, especially over the slicks, in that they gave rise to an intense fan culture. This means that pulp authors, pulp themes, pulp stories, have continually been reinjected into our culture because of these fans. Fans of pulp fiction created various communities dedicated to perpetuating the art found within this stories. The community where I began as a writer, the science fiction world, had its beginning in these pulp journals. Because of the patronage of this community there is one science fiction journal whose publication has continued uninterrupted from the early pulp era (Analog) and there are two other journals that have been published continuously since the late pulp era: Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. There are also a number of other journals publishing today that trace some spiritual lineage to the pulp era.In the 1930s, these fans started to have conventions. They created fanzines: amateur publications that they mailed to each other, where they would discuss topics related to pulp stories. At the World Science Fiction Convention, they began to give out awards for the best story published in the previous year. In the 1948, two science fiction fans started Gnome Press, with the aim of republishing some of these classic pulp stories. They published the first collections, for instance, of Isaac Asimov's Foundation stories. They were also the first to reprint the Conan stories in book form. The press was troubled by financial difficulties, had issues with distributing books and paying its authors, but it proved there was a market for these books, and shortly thereafter some better-capitalized publishers started sci-fi/fantasy lines. The Conan stories were subsequently republished by Ace in the 1960s, by Berkley in the 1970s, by Tor in the 1990s.What's interesting about Conan is that fans have kept him alive for a hundred years, and there've even been critical volumes (created by amateur literary critics) devoted to discussing his style, themes, literary genealogy, and impact, but...he has never quite crossed over and become canonized.Other pulp fiction writers—Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, H.P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith (the latter two published primarily in Weird Tales)—made the jump. They got reissued by Penguin Classics. They got Library of America volumes. They got some kind of professionalized literary attention. Robert E. Howard never did.Howard is part of what I like to call \"the shadow canon\"—writers that are really old, continuously in print, highly-beloved, but which are generally not taught in universities or discussed by academics. The shadow canon is smaller than the regular canon, but it includes Asimov, Heinlein, L. Ron Hubbard, Dale Carnegie, Roots, and I'm sure many other books that are slipping my mind. The shadow canon exists because intergenerational word-of-mouth exists—universities and book reviews and reading lists are not the only place people find out about books. I started reading The Foundation because my mom read it as a girl in India—now the TV show is surely introducing the novel to a new generation of readers.Source: Internet ArchiveConan was serious businessI think what struck me most about Conan was this: I used to read submissions for a sci-fi/fantasy journal, Strange Horizons—over one year I read about 900 stories—and many of these stories used themes, settings, characters that were somehow inspired by Conan; however, in an almost all cases, the stories put some spin on it—they attempted to deconstruct or subvert this hero. They either played him for laughs, or they gave him some kind of angst. They never played it straight. It's kind of like princess tales. You never see a princess anymore where she just sits around and gets rescued by a man. She's always taking matters into her own hands—she's always tough and independent.Similarly, with fantasy stories today, you never see a story that just wholeheartedly believes in its strong, hunky barbarian protagonist. They almost always put a spin on him.Whereas these Conan stories are so serious! The author, Robert E. Howard, was quite young when he wrote these stories: he died by suicide at age 30, so he was in his mid-twenties when he wrote most of the Conan tales. And they seem like a very naked fantasy of unlimited power, strength, sex appeal. They go down directly into the id. There is no super-ego here: there is no doubt, no self-censorship—a fact one of the stories remarks upon. At some point Conan is fighting a beast, and the narration says:The monster below them, to Conan, was merely a form of life differing from himself mainly in physical shape. He attributed to it characteristics similar to his own, and saw in its wrath a counterpart of his rages, in its roars and bellowings merely reptilian equivalents to the curses he had bestowed upon it. Conan is a beast himself, and as such he's always dead certain of his course of action. Moreover, he is a beast who always wins, always gets the girl. It's really very stimulating.And for this kind of tale, the writing also needs to have zero doubt. This writing is filled with a fanatical sense of conviction. Every line screams out that this story is deadly important and needs to be taken seriously—there is no subversion, no winking to the camera. It is a really impressive performance.And...that's why Conan is good.It's no surprise that academia hasn't taken him up, because what is there to say? Conan is awesome. It's all written right on the surface.I will say, I read one critical volume about Conan, The Dark Barbarian, that was edited by a fan, Don Herron, and this volume had an essay that tied Conan to the hard-boiled tradition. That Conan is basically a hard-boiled detective hero (a la Dashiell Hammett's Continental Op) transferred to a fantasy world. There was another nice essay about the existentialist philoosophy that seems espoused by Conan. There's plenty of smart things to say! In fact, I am sure a better critic than me could say something very interesting, about the way this writing, on the level of the line, is perfectly calibrated to the needs of the story. But when it comes to preserving and enjoying these stories, all this apparatus is unnecessary. The simplest explanation for his appeal is the truest one: he is a naked power fantasy, and...these kinds of fantasies are very fun.The types of Conan storiesThere are three major Conans. There's Conan the thief, Conan the adventurer, and Conan the King. In some stories he is young: he's a hired-hand, scrabbling for adventurer in the interstices of the settled world—in these stories he's often plotting to steal something, or he's on the run from someone. In other stories, he's more established: he's the Captain of the Guard or the leader of a war-band. And then at some point in his timeline, he is serving as a mercenary captain in the army of the King of Aquilonia, and he kills the King, overthrowing him, and usurping his throne, and there's a set of stories where King Conan fights to keep this throne.The three Conans seem quite different. In the King Conan stories, he is distinctly middle-aged, more cautious—he's weary of war and conquest, anxious to make sure his citizenry is happy under his rule. His portrayal is clearly very influenced by King Theodoric, the Ostrogothic King who usurped the Western Roman Empire, and who (at least reputedly) went to some lengths to integrate his people with the existing Roman elite. The best of the King Conan stories is \"The Phoenix on the Sword\", where Conan struggles haplessly against the rebellious undercurrent in his subjects.When I overthrew Numedides, then I was the Liberator – now they spit at my shadow. They have put a statue of that swine in the temple of Mitra, and people go and wail before it, hailing it as the holy effigy of a saintly monarch who was done to death by a red-handed barbarian. When I led her armies to victory as a mercenary, Aquilonia overlooked the fact that I was a foreigner, but now she can not forgive me.In the war-leader stories, you have the most classic Conan—strong and confident, somewhat brash, anxious for war and conquest. He's always defeating other chieftain and captains and pirate kings and usurping their bands, or carrying off women and doing classic barbarian stuff. The best of these is \"A Witch Shall Be Born\", where Conan literally gets crucified by a usurping witch-queen, then comes down off the cross and takes the city by storm.Then in the Conan the thief stories, he usually seems a bit more hapless, more confused. The best of these is \"The God in the Bowl\", where Conan gets caught robbing a temple and gets involved in a murder-mystery.Some Conan stories also have a cosmic-horror element, where the hero encounters some eldritch foe from another time and place. The best of these tales was \"The Slithering Shadow\", where Conan stumbles on a city full of hapless dreamers, who are being stalked by a terrible demon. As one of the women in the city explains:For untold generations Thog has preyed on them. He has been one of the factors which have reduced their numbers from thousands to hundreds. A few more generations and they will be extinct, and Thog must either fare forth into the world for new prey, or retire to the underworld whence he came so long ago....They realize their ultimate doom, but they are fatalists, incapable of resistance or escape.That was a particularly good story, which I highly recommend.Some of the stories are better than others. There are a few Conan stories where the pacing feels a bit slow, and the adventures seem somewhat rote. This is particularly true of the two longest Conan stories: \"The People of the Black Circle\" and \"The Hour of the Dragon\". If you're looking into reading Conan, all the original stories (i.e. those completed by Robert E. Howard during his life) are reprinted in these three volumes: of these, I recommend the first (The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian) and the third (The Conquering Sword of Conan)—the middle volume (The Bloody Crown of Conan) is primarily comprised of the two long tales that I don't recommend.At his worst, Conan can be pretty tedious—just a lot of running around, meeting and killing various interchangeable enemies. But at his best, Conan is like James Bond, and he is good for precisely the same reason: the continuous juxtaposition of sex, danger, and decadence. In Conan, you have these fantastically old cities and temples, that reek of immense age, which are often haunted by gods and demons and wizards, and then you have this simple guy who cuts through all these complexity with the force of his blade, and who gets the girl while he does it.Is Conan literature?You know...the term 'literature' is useful for getting people to read stuff that they wouldn't otherwise read. People wouldn't read Proust if they didn't think it was literature, and they should read Proust, so it's good to have that term. But with Conan, the term seems so unnecessary. There is still a lot of life left in Conan. He still acts on the modern nervous system exactly the way he acted on the nervous system of young men in the 1930s. There's no need to mess around here, try to rehabilitate or revive him. He is strong, and he is healthy. There is a good chance he will outlast us all.The racial politics of Conan are not goodConan's treatment of race is difficult to ignore. There are many, many Conan stories that feature hordes of nameless Black people. And in at least three stories (\"Hour of the Dragon\", \"Queen of the Black Cost\", and \"Jewels of Gwahlur\") you have the same thing, where you've got these nameless black people that are ruled over by a white person. There's also repeated mentions of Conan's whiteness, in a way that makes the subtext very clear: he is a white-skinned barbarian hero who runs around physically dominating savage Black people and decadent brown people.I will say, there is another famous writer whose work appeared primarily in Weird Tales: H.P. Lovecraft. And Lovecraft's work seems much more racist than Howard's. Lovecraft has several stories that are very explicitly about non-white people being terrible and evil—I'm thinking particularly of \"The Horror at Red Hook\", which is about some non-white people in Brooklyn who are demon worshippers and are kidnapping women for their cannibalistic rituals.In contrast, it's true that the Conan stories partake of some kind of racial paranoia or power fantasy, but it doesn't feel quite as bad—the effect is similar to watching the Rocky movies, where you've got poor, downtrodden Rocky Balboa, and he's always beating up these rich, powerful Black guys, and you're like...what are these movies trying to say? Well...it's obvious, but it feels good-natured enough that it's still possible for non-white people to enjoy it.3The death of the short storyLovecraft is the other iconic writer produced by Weird Tales. I hope to read his stories at some point and write about him as well. There's also, rather incredibly, another small pulp journal that also produced two literary stars: Black Mask published all of Dashiell Hammett's novels and many of Raymond Chandler's stories. However for these writers I don't know if their short fiction really constitutes their best output, and I don't have a strong desire to reread their novels—I read them all ten years ago when I went through a detective fiction phase.My intention after I wrote about Raymond Carver was to write about some other 20th-century masters of the short story—Hemingway was going to be next—but as you can see I've gotten hopelessly sidetracked.My problem is simple. There is this type of fiction we all know about—the highbrow story, the New Yorker story, the type of story you learn to write in MFA courses—and for the last thirty years, everyone in the literary world has been wondering what happened to this story. Why does there seem to be so much less interest in this type of fiction? And they look back at the 20th century, when Old Man and the Sea was reprinted by Life, and they think...what changed?Well, to me, the answer is that Hemingway existed in a world that contained pulp short fiction and middlebrow short fiction. And that these two types of fiction were, in some mystical way, responsible for the vitality of the short story. The literary short story defined itself by not being this other kind of story. And then this other kind of story disappeared, but the literary story hung on, decade after decade, as a sort of remnant, but without the other forms to war against, the highbrow short story lost its sense of purpose.That's my theory, and perhaps in some later post I will develop it in more detail.What I do, in my own short fiction, is clearly not a highbrow New Yorker type story. It's something different—a form whose pleasures are much more immediate and much more accessible. As such, I personally have a lot more to learn from writers like Robert E. Howard and O. Henry than I do from Raymond Carver and Ernest Hemingway—I respect the latters' work immensely, but I did an entire graduate degree (an MFA) where I assimilated their influence, and now it feels right to go looking further afield for other influences.Which is a long way of saying that I've written a ridiculously-earnest Conan-type story of my own that you'll hopefully be reading this Thursday: it's about a virile, rugged twenty-year-old Paladin who'll lose his powers if he has sex.Woman of Letters publishes critical essays (like this one) on Tuesdays and short tales on Thursdays. If you enjoyed this post, please consider subscribing.1If you want to know more about this taxonomy, I recommend this extremely helpful journal article I found on the subject.2I will note that the story is complicated. During this period, many journals altered their size, paper quality, and format—so journals often seemed more pulp-like or slick-like or highbrow during various points in their history. What I am identifying are general tendencies, not hard and fast rules3I was talking to about Conan, and she clued me in to Charles R. Saunders, a Conan fan who went on to write, Imaro, a distinctively African take on the barbarian trope. From his NYT obituary:As a child he had been enthralled by the fantasies spun by white writers like Robert E. Howard, who created Conan the Barbarian, and Edgar Rice Burroughs, who created Tarzan, the white African figure embodied most famously on the screen by Johnny Weissmuller. But he came to recognize the racism inherent in such works. Imaro was the result.",

There is a difference between social intelligence and wisdom. Social intelligence helps you to understand and interact well with others. Wisdom, in contrast, seeks to discover a common good through a balancing of interests. Thus, a salesperson who sells a defective car to a customer might have the social intelligence to successfully manipulate the customer, but has not acted wisely. Wisdom is used toward the attainment of ends that produce a common good, whereas intelligence can be used in the service of either good ends or bad ones. (source).2.

      "content": "Here's a question: suppose there are two philosophical views, A and B. Both of them equally well predict everything we see, including our intuitions about various philosophical matters. They also both have the same theoretical virtues—simplicity, unity, explanatory power, etc. To a detached observer with no prior commitments, they would seem equally likely. However, there is one difference between them: given our intuitions, A seems more true than B. A vindicates many of our intuitions, and considers as true many things we pre-theoretically belief. B, in contrast, has to be revisionary, considering our intuitions biased or otherwise in error. However, keep in mind that we would be just as likely to have the intuitions we do conditional on B being true. The question: given this situation, what, if anything, do you decide to believe? In particular, do you suspend judgment, or do you believe A? I've recently discovered that I'm weird in saying we should suspend judgment in a case such as the above, given the stipulations. I've talked about what I think the proper role of intuition in philosophy is, and I'll quote myself here: I am not \"against intuition\" in general. I am against intuition as the ultimate justification for moral principles. I believe the philosopher should use intuitions in exactly the same ways the mathematician does. For the mathematician, intuition is indispensable: it is needed to know what lines of inquiry are worth putting effort into, making guesses as to what is true so that you know what to try to prove, and looking for flaws in others' proofs. But mathematicians do not publish papers where their ultimate justification is that their claim achieves the best balance of intuitions; insofar as they might explicitly rely on such, they recognize their understanding as defective, and continue looking for an actual proof. Likewise, in ethical philosophy, we need intuitions for the same reasons: if the Categorical Imperative turns out to imply it's immoral to wear a green shirt on a Tuesday, I need to go back and check my work; if I find myself having to choose whether to kill one man to harvest his organs and save five, I will refrain from doing so because it is intuitively wrong, as I do not yet have an Ethical Theory of Everything. But as long as I am relying on intuition, my judgments are merely provisional, and I need to continue the search for actual justifications for them.In sum, I think intuitions are empirical evidence, nothing more. I think, at least when it comes to theoretical and empirical knowledge, we have good evidence that our intuitions do better than chance at tracking truth, so they do count as evidence for the intuitively true proposition.1 But the way empirical evidence works is that if two hypotheses are both equally good at predicting the evidence, and if your priors in the two hypotheses are similar, then the two hypotheses get similar credences. But does the scenario I opened with ever actually happen? Maybe it's a bit extreme, to assume two views have equal priors and that they both equally well predict our intuitions. Maybe the intuitively-correct views have more going for them than that they predict our intuitions while also vindicating them.As a matter of fact, I think the scenario I opened up with is very unlikely. But generally things fail in the other direction. Non-intuitive views have quite a bit going for them by way of simplicity, naturalness, arguments, etc., while also being compatible with perfectly likely and independent stories about why our intuitions are the way they are—as a matter of fact, that's why anyone believes them in the first place. On the other hand, the intuitive views are propped up, mainly, by the fact that they vindicate intuitions. Were we banned from appealing to intuitions except as empirical data, I think proponents of the latter views would be left utterly unarmed. Moral Law Within is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.Consider, for example, the issue of robust moral realism—which holds that some actions are objectively obligatory, and that such involves the actions having metaphysically irreducible, intrinsically normative properties that are as part of the fabric of reality as mass and charge—and moral skepticism. Moral skeptics are often motivated by the idea that intrinsically normative properties would be strange and unlike anything we know to exist (see Mackie's \"Argument from Queerness\"2), and that the reality we are acquainted with can be perfectly well accounted for without them. Robust realists, on the other hand, argue that their view is the only or best way to vindicate our intuitions, and they address skeptical arguments piecemeal, often with the charge that accepting them would lead to skepticism in other areas. What evidence do our intuitions give? Conditional on robust realism being true, we can grant that the probability that our intuitions pointing to the position would be fair. But also conditional on moral skepticism, the way things seem to us make perfect sense—when we consider a horrendous action, we very powerfully feel as though it is simply to be ruled out, and it is not hard to give an evolutionary explanation as to why such a feeling would arise. I think a neutral outsider would judge it to be fairly likely that things appear to us the way they do conditional both on robust realism and moral skepticism being true. And what of the prior probabilities, that is, the likelihood of either view without the evidence of intuition? I'd wager that, for aliens without these intuitions, the idea of robust moral realism would not occur to them in a million years, and it would seem very implausible if suggested to them. If anything, the prior likelihood of moral skepticism is much higher. And how are we any different from them, except in that we have the evidence of intuition?3 Why, then, should we believe anything different from what they believe if they updated on the empirical evidence provided by intuition? What about skepticism in general, the idea that most or all of the knowledge we take ourselves to have is not in fact knowledge? Again, there are powerful arguments for skepticism, which is why people are inclined to accept it in the first place. And we can very easily explain why skepticism seems strange conditional on skepticism being true; evolution optimizes us to live in the world we actually live in, not the world we can justifiedly believe ourselves to live in, so it is natural that we would see a tiger and take ourselves to know there's a tiger. Requiring that we rule out being a brain in a vat isn't useful for beings optimized to live in a world where we are not brains in vats. So, our intuitions about the matter don't seem to be much evidence against skepticism.4 And because of our inner desire to vindicate intuitions, positions have been dreamt up that should have never even seen the light of day.5 Consider, for example, the \"modal realism\" of David Lewis. On this view, all possible worlds are as real as the actual world—the only thing special about the actual world is that we're in it. It's possible that the world could have just consisted of a single cat eternally eating some grass—so, for Lewis, there is a real possible world out there where such is the case. Why did he believe this? Was he a Leibnizian who thought it would be arbitrary for one possibility to be actualized instead of another? No, the reality is far less respectable. He believed it because it is a useful assumption which helps our other philosophical theories work out. We need to talk about what's possible to do nearly any metaphysics; the Lover of Wisdom finds Problems with all other accounts of possible states of affairs; therefore, we are left with modal realism. I think it should be clear to those unfamiliar with the Love of Wisdom that no considerations of that sort can be used to justify a claim of that sort. \"Well, it seems this is what has to be posited for our Best Theories to work out, and I'm justified in believing in whatever is quantified over in our Best Theories\"—is this reasoning sensitive to the concrete existence of possible worlds? Wouldn't we be getting along just the same, doing everything we want to do without concrete possible worlds? Frankly, I think it is a scandal to the field that it developed in a manner so as to cause these thoughts to exist and not be immediately dismissed. Why did this happen? Well, most philosophers do not treat intuitions as empirical evidence which should be dispensed with once we actually figure things out. They think that if two views differ equally in every respect—including how well they predict the fact of our having certain intuitions—then the one that better vindicates our intuitions is to be preferred. Intuitions, for them, are little vectors pointing at truths, though imperfect ones, so we need to add all of them up and see what they point to on net, and then we have a strong reason to believe whatever they point to. On this view, of course they can be used as a tiebreaker. Intuitions do not count as empirical evidence, the lovers of intuition often say—rather, they are or can be the operation of a priori reasoning. But come on, what actually happens when you see a proposition as self-evident, or as intuitively true? You think about a claim, and you have a reaction. You're not getting any information other than that you associate a certain feeling with a certain proposition. What if half of people found moral realism self-evident, and the other half didn't, with the realists being blonde and the skeptics being brunette? Would you have a different belief conditional on finding out you're a blonde than you would conditional on finding moral realism intuitive? No, you should believe depending on the probability of the claim in question given your evidence, whether it be evidence about your hair color or what feelings you associate with a proposition. But if it is indeed true in the actual world that the probability of moral realism conditional on the empirical fact of your having a certain intuition is, say, less than 0.5 (which should be more or less true, if we can indeed account for our having certain intuitions conditional on moral skepticism being true), then why should the actual existence of people for whom the evidence is misleading matter? Why is a strategy for belief that foreseeably leads half of the actual people to failure an intolerable one, but a strategy that foreseeably leads half of the possible people to failure a fine one? It seems, then, the feelings you associate with a proposition should relate to your belief in the same kind of way any empirical evidence should. [EDIT—A lot of people are bringing up an important point, so I'll address it here. The point is that in order to use intuitions as empirical evidence, you need a prior, which seems like it must be formed through the use of intuition. Indeed, in the opening and later I appeal to simplicity, which is a relevant consideration for many people because they think simple things are more likely to be true because that's intuitively so. I will not hinge this post on the a priori status of Occam's razor or on its restriction to the world of experience, and indeed I think this worry is easier to get around. Put simply, I can grant that intuitions are necessary for us to figure out the correct priors in the first place, but that is irrelevant to what I say here. My argument is successful if what I say goes through given the actual priors I and the reader have, independently of where the priors comes from. I am meeting the reader where they are at, not questioning how they got to where they are. From our savior Bayes, we know that the odds of, say, robust moral realism conditional on our intuitions is equal to the likelihood ratio (how relatively well the truth of robust realism predicts our having certain intuitions) multiplied by the prior odds of robust realism. Prior, that is, to our intuitions about robust realism. It hardly seems that these prior odds are in favor of robust realism. Even if I have to resort to using intuitions somewhere else, say when it comes to Occam's razor, it would remain that this likelihood ratio is 1 and these prior odds are not high, so belief in robust realism is not justified.It should be instructive that the scientist does ultimately rely on intuitive justification—I imagine if you raised the possibility that his results are simulations in the Matrix, he would just say \"Okay, I don't know, I just assume otherwise\"—and yet he does not spend any time thinking about intuitions as such. There's just the usual matters of unity, simplicity, etc., and then how likely the data is given a theory. Even granting that intuitions are indispensible somewhere would not require one to think they should be appealed to in any way remotely resembling what analytic philosophers do.]Well, there is one way it can make sense to give accounts of knowledge, morality, etc. using \"the sum of our intuitions is basically correct\" as a premise. That would be if the relevant facts about the subject matter were such that the truths about the matter and our intuitions about them were no coincidence. Consider, for example, someone who thinks that diamond is stacked layers of hexagonal lattices of carbon atoms, while graphite is carbon atoms arranged in a cubic lattice. No, they are not misunderstanding the conventions around the words—they know full well that people think diamond is the cubic lattice and that graphite is the hexagonal lattice, but they think things are in fact the other way around. Nor does our individual think they have any shocking empirical discoveries, such as that scientists screwed up when investigating the molecular structure of paradigmatic diamonds. This person just thinks graphite is itself the thing people put on engagement rings, and diamond is the stuff pencils write with, knowing full well that the stuff on engagement rings have a cubic structure and the pencil lead has a hexagonal one. A normal person considering this scenario will think the individual is confused about the words they use. \"Diamond\" just is the word we use to refer to the hard, shiny rock people often put on engagement rings, and \"graphite\" just is the word we use to refer to the stuff pencils usually write with, and they turn out to have the molecular structures people take them to have. Now, if they take the claim at face value, Lovers of Wisdom will think it is a level confusion to suppose that diamonds are such-and-such rocks with such-and-such structure because we use the word \"diamond\" in a certain way; note that the former claim is a claim about diamonds, not the word \"diamond.\"6 But I trust that the reader can understand me when I refer to the sense in which the guy from our example is merely confused about words, and that the facts about our conventions surrounding the relevant words are enough to rule his position out.7 It is, then, no surprise that we surmise the nature of diamonds in part by looking at what people intuitively refer to as diamonds; diamonds are the shiny hard rocks people put on rings, and we should investigate those paradigmatic rocks if we want to learn more about the diamond's nature. If people disagreed about the molecular structure of diamonds, not due to empirical disagreement but rather due to disagreement as to which rocks count as a diamond, then weighing up our intuitions would make sense, since it's true a priori that diamonds are the things that are sufficiently similar to paradigm examples of diamonds. So, likewise, we may think that the concepts of morality and knowledge have to correspond to our intuitions as a whole, because their natures are determined conventionally, in the same sense the nature of a diamond is in part determined conventionally. Maybe knowledge just is the thing English speakers express with the word \"knows,\" and morality just is the thing English speakers express with the word \"ought,\" and so it's no wonder that there is a preestablished harmony between their natures and our intuitions. For the philosopher who is skeptical of the possibility of completely a priori normativity (whether about belief or action) or about the existence of any a priori concepts, this seems like an entirely reasonable view. But this is emphatically not what the average Standard Realist about morality or knowledge wants to conceive of themselves as doing.8 They think these concepts are real and significant independently of the fact that the words for them play an important role in our language. The choice to worry about the good instead of some other possible concept that could apply to action is not supposed to be determined by accident; the good intrinsically matters to any rational being, or at least it should, in a sense deeper than merely saying \"the good is good.\" Look. The significance of your conclusions cannot go any further than the scope of your justification for them. If the reason our diamond-truther is wrong is because (in a sense) he is using words in an unconventional way, then what we say to him has no more significance than does the claim \"The things that people paradigmatically refer to as 'diamonds' have a cubic structure,\" as semantically different as that claim may be from \"Diamonds have a cuboid structure.\" You can't get things for free by going down a level. Likewise, if paradigm cases of immoral action are by themselves to in-principle constraints on what can be believed to be immoral, then the Lover of Wisdom's conclusions cannot have any more significance than does the claim \"The actions paradigmatically referred to as 'immoral' have such-and-such properties.\" The view on which intuitions intrinsically, and not as a matter of empirically verifiable correlation, point towards truth is necessarily an antirealist one.I don't think it can be overemphasized how set apart I am from most contemporary philosophy by viewing the evidence from intuition as merely empirical, and by viewing as indifferent theories that predict our intuitions (whether they vindicate them or not) equally well, all else equal. This problem is everywhere. To name a few more places: the idea of \"thick moral concepts\" as being a problem for theories that cleanly separate the descriptive and the normative; the demandingness objection to consequentialism; dismissal of skepticism about weakness of will; opposition to nominalism; and so on. Really, so much of the contemporary discourse is shaped by the fact that people are allowed to give easy answers to hard questions, expecting that the mere fact that they say things are as they seem outweighs the a priori implausibility of their views. To a large extent, when it comes to foundational matters regarding normativity and metaphysics, your job is to either formulate skeptical arguments against views that hardly had any actual support in the first place but which are given an arbitrary advantage, or else address such arguments. Subscribe now1I also think, as a matter of fact, that intuitions do better than chance when it comes to moral claims, though most philosophers are not in a position to justifiedly believe this. The reason they are better than chance is because the processes that formed our intuitions weakly track universalizability. 2See his Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong. 3Sure, they do have the evidence of lacking an intuition. If you think this is a crux, think carefully about whether things would appear any different before reflecting in a manner that makes your intuitions manifest. 4\"But,\" you say, \"you are appealing to knowledge in order to provide this explanation of our intuitions.\" So? Non-skeptics believe evolution is true, and so if their view of the world is one on which their intuitions do not provide evidence against skepticism, then the skeptics win. 5Okay, we can argue about whether intuitions are the culprit here, but it's the same problem. 6This is another example of how Lovers of Wisdom prevent objections to their views by making them inarticulable. 7Properly, what I should say is that \"diamond\" refers to the concept dthat[λx.x is the same kind of thing as what English speakers paradigmatically refer to as diamonds]. This explains why there's a preestablished harmony between intuition and facts about diamonds without making any apparent level confusions. 8Usually, at least. But Scanlon, in Being Realistic about Reasons, seems to be quite comfortable portraying himself as merely talking about accidental conventions (or \"frameworks\").",

The list so far:Why did the rich pull away from the rest?The importance of worker powerA Trumpian diversionOligarchs and the rise of mega-fortunesNow, on to current events.Trump has now announced a trade \"deal\" with the European Union that looks a lot like the \"deal\" he made with Japan. I use scare quotes because there is little sign of a quid pro quo. The United States is imposing a 15 percent tariff that is lower than previously threatened, but still vastly higher than we had before Trump. Overall U.S. tariffs seem likely to settle roughly at the level that prevailed after the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930.In return we got a vague promise of higher European investment in the United States. When Japan made a similar promise last week, administration officials asserted that this would mean hundreds of billions flowing into rebuilding U.S. industry. Japanese officials, however, say that the money will consist almost entirely of loans and loan guarantees. This strongly suggests that Japan will, if it does anything at all, simply be sticking Trump's name on money flows that would have happened anyway. There's every reason to suspect that the same will be true of whatever the EU does.And like the Japan deal, this deal seems to place lower tariffs on cars made in Europe, which have very little U.S. content, than on cars made in Canada, which contain many American parts. Add in the punishing tariffs on steel and aluminum, and Trump's trade policy seems, if anything, to be tilting the playing field against U.S. manufacturing.When I point out that Trump's idea of trade deals seems counterproductive even in terms of his claimed goal of boosting manufacturing, I get some pushback from readers along these lines: \"Oh, yeah? If you're such an expert on trade negotiations, tell me what deal you think you could have made.\"OK, I can answer that. If I had been in charge of negotiating with the European Union, I would have been able to get a deal with the following components:· Very low tariffs on U.S. exports of manufactured goods to Europe, on the order of 1 percent· Near balance in bilateral trade, with U.S. exports to Europe close to 90 percent of our imports from Europe· U.S. companies allowed to operate freely in Europe, earning hundreds of billions a year in profits· European corporations investing more than $150 billion a year — real investment, not loans — in the United StatesWhy do I believe that I could have negotiated a deal like that? Because that's what U.S.-EU international transactions actually looked like in 2024. So that's what we could have gotten by doing nothing.Before Trump returned to power, U.S. nonagricultural exports to the EU faced an average tariff rate — that's the number \"MFN AVG of traded TL\" in this table — of 1 percent. As for U.S. transactions with Europe, they looked like this:Source: Bureau of Economic AnalysisIf the trade imbalance looks smaller than the numbers you may have heard, that's because Trump likes to talk about trade balances in goods, but ignores the fact that America runs a substantial trade surplus in services. If you include both goods and services — and why wouldn't you? — U.S.-Europe trade is fairly close to balance.But if the US-EU trade relationship was more or less OK last year, why did Trump impose huge tariffs and leave many of them in place even after the so-called deal? Because he felt like it. You won't get anywhere in understanding the trade war if you insist on believing that Trump's tariffs are a response to any legitimate grievances. And he failed to gain any significant concessions, mainly because Europe was already behaving well and had nothing to concede.So was the US-EU trade deal basically a nothingburger? (Substitute some European food for burger, if you like.) No, it was a bad thing, but mainly for political reasons.1. Trump probably believes he won, which will just encourage him to persist with his trade war.2. This will hurt the world economy, with the burden falling mainly on lower-income Americans. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that Trump's tariffs will leave the U.S. economy 0.4 percent poorer in the long run, which is very close to my own back-of-the-envelope calculations. But the tariffs are basically a sales tax that will reduce real income for poor and working-class families by about 1.5 percent, even as cuts in other taxes raise income for the wealthy.3. European negotiators didn't make many substantive concessions, but they pretended to give ground — and they didn't retaliate, even though they were clearly entitled to do so, because the U.S. has just gone back on all its solemn past agreements. This makes the EU look weak, which is a bad omen for its ability to deal with real challenges, starting with helping Ukraine.Two less discouraging aspects of what just happened: First, Trump appears to have backed down on the idea of treating European value-added taxes as an unfair barrier to U.S. exports (which they aren't, but facts don't matter here.) So that's one potentially awful confrontation avoided, at least for now.Second, if this trade deal was in part an attempt to drive Epstein from the top of the news, my sense of the news flow is that it has been a complete flop.Still, if I were a European I'd be very angry at anything that even looks like Trump appeasement. The EU is an economic superpower, especially if it allies itself with the UK. It needs to start acting like it.NONMUSICAL CODALive shot of US trade policy",

      "content": "Cicero, played by David Bamber, speaking to the Roman Senate in the excellent HBO series, \"Rome.\" Image from hbo-rome.fandom.com.Do Stoicism and politics go together? And if so, how? I have recently published two essays criticizing both US President Trump and his Vice President, J.D. Vance, from a Stoic perspective. Yet, I often hear claims that Stoicism is by its very nature conservative, politically speaking. Or perhaps that it has actually nothing to say about politics at all.As is often the case, much depends on what one means by key terms, like \"politics\" and \"conservative.\" Let's start with the first one: if by \"political\" one means partisan, then no, Stoicism isn't about partisanship. There is no principled Stoic way I can see to prefer, say, Democrats to Republicans, or the other way around, for that matter.But if political one means \"concerning the polis,\" as originally proposed by Aristotle, then Stoicism very much is a political philosophy, because it aims at making every citizen into a better human being, understood specifically as a more reasonable and prosocial one. Moreover, Stoicism is a fundamentally cosmopolitan philosophy, and cosmopolitanism has huge political implications. A Stoic ought to strive to treat every human being, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, gender, and so forth, as a brother or sister. Which means also being in favor of as liberal an immigration policy as pragmatically feasible at any given moment, and aspiring, long term, to a human society with no borders or nationalities.What I'd like to focus on here, though, is this business of conservatives vs progressives. To some extent, the meaning of those words is specific to a particular situation, both in space and time. In the United States, for instance, right now being a conservative largely means getting onto the MAGA bandwagon built by Donald Trump, even though it meant something quite different until only a few years ago. Conversely, to be progressive, again in the US at the moment means, among other things, to espouse the sort of identity politics that would have been considered antithetical to the universalism classically adopted by left-leaning parties in the western world.That said, one can identify a family resemblance of sorts between conservative or progressive positions across time and space, to a point. For instance, in Ancient Rome the two major \"parties,\" perhaps better described as factions, of the Senate were the populares (literally, supporters of the people) and the optimates (literally \"the best ones,\" that is the aristocrats).While modern historians debate the reality and extent of the division, Cicero very clearly identified the two groups in his discourse, Pro Sestio, written in 56 BCE. Broadly speaking, the optimates were in favor of retaining the traditional role and powers of the Senate and against land reforms, while the populares supported both the power of the popular assemblies and land reforms.Such reforms were the principal, though by no means the only, debate pitting optimates and populares against each other. During the 2nd century BCE, they were primarily initiated by the famous Tiberius Gracchus, who proposed laws to limit land ownership and redistribute public land to small farmers. These reforms aimed to address the growing inequality and decline of small landholders but faced strong opposition from the wealthy elite and ultimately had limited long-term success. Tiberius, and later his brother, Gaius, were killed in the process, and a reasonable argument can be made that the inability of the Senate to enact reforms aimed at decreasing extreme inequality led to the demise of the Roman Republic. (Are you listening, United States of America?)So one way to answer the question of whether Stoicism leans conservative or progressive is to see whether Stoics historically sided with the optimates or the populares. The answer is: both!One of the classic Stoic role models was Cato the Younger (95-46 BCE), who is much praised by Seneca. Cato embodied Stoic virtue in Roman political life through unwavering adherence to principle over pragmatism. As a senator, he consistently opposed what he saw as corruption and the concentration of power, most notably resisting Julius Caesar's rise and the machinations of the First Triumvirate. Cato was a member of the optimates, while Caesar aligned himself with the populares.Through a Stoic lens, Cato's political career represents the ideal of acting according to virtue regardless of consequences. He famously walked barefoot through winter and wore a black toga in the Senate to protest Caesar's consulship, demonstrating that external circumstances couldn't compromise his moral stance. His speeches and filibusters were not calculated for political gain but flowed from his commitment to what he believed was right. His moral stature was so appreciated in Rome that when people were caught doing something unethical they might say \"well, not everyone's a Cato!\"His ultimate act—suicide at Utica in 46 BCE rather than accept Caesar's pardon—exemplifies the Stoic principle that freedom lies in choosing one's response to fate. Cato chose death over living under what he considered tyranny, maintaining his integrity to the end. The Stoics saw this not as despair but as the ultimate expression of human agency: when you cannot control external events, you can still control your response. That's why Cato became a Stoic role model, personifying how philosophical principles should guide political action. His life reflected the principle that virtue is its own reward and that maintaining moral consistency matters more than achieving political success or even preserving one's life.Now compare Cato to another politically active Stoic, Gaius Blossius (2nd century BCE). Blossius hailed from Cumae in Campania, Italy, and was a student of the renowned Stoic philosopher Antipater of Tarsus. Blossius served as both teacher and ideological advisor to the above mentioned Tiberius Gracchus, instigating him (along with the Greek rhetorician Diophanes) to pursue land reform on behalf of the plebs, thus aligning himself squarely with the populares.Stoically speaking, Blossius embodied the principle that philosophical convictions must translate into political action for the common good. The Stoic emphasis on duty had special influence on Tiberius through Blossius, enhancing his natural determination and sense of moral obligation. Contra the stereotype of Stoicism as disengaged from political practice, Blossius believed that virtue required active engagement with issues of social justice.His commitment to principle over personal safety became clear after Tiberius's assassination. When interrogated by the consuls, Blossius freely admitted he had helped Tiberius. When pressed with the hypothetical question \"What if Tiberius had ordered you to burn the Capitol?\" Blossius replied that Tiberius would never have given such an order, but if he had, \"it would have been right for me to do it; for he never would have commanded it, if it had not been for the people's good.\"This response may sound rather rigid and dogmatic, but it reflects the Stoic belief in the fundamental rationality and virtue of the wise man—Blossius trusted completely in Tiberius's moral judgment. Blossius was eventually pardoned and moved to Asia Minor where he joined Aristonicus's uprising against the Romans. When that movement also was defeated, he killed himself, enacting the Stoic principle that when one cannot live according to virtue under external circumstances, death becomes preferable to compromise. In this respect, both Blossius and Cato walked through what Epictetus later on will famously call \"the open door,\" the ultimate source of freedom for a Stoic.Both Cato and Blossius exemplified Stoic virtue in politics but represented dramatically different approaches to implementing philosophical principles in the Roman Republic. Cato embodied traditional, conservative Stoicism—upholding ancestral customs (what was called the mos maiorum, the way of the ancestors) and established republican institutions as expressions of virtue. Blossius represented radical Stoicism, believing that justice required challenging existing power structures and championing the dispossessed. Both saw virtue as absolute, but applied it differently.Methodologically, Cato at least initially worked within the system as a senator and magistrate, using constitutional means to oppose what he saw as corruption and tyranny. His resistance was institutional—filibusters, speeches, symbolic protests. Blossius operated as an advisor and ideologist, encouraging revolutionary land reform and supporting movements that bypassed traditional senatorial authority.Moreover, Cato's loyalty was to abstract principles and the Republic itself—he famously opposed even allies like Cicero when he saw them as compromising his standards. Blossius, by contrast, demonstrated intense personal loyalty to individuals (first Tiberius Gracchus, then Aristonicus), trusting completely in their moral judgment and following them to the end.Both men chose death over compromise, but for different reasons. Cato's suicide was a rejection of Caesar's personal rule—he died for republican independence. Blossius's suicide after Aristonicus's defeat was the end of a revolutionary path—he died when his vision of social justice was crushed.In terms of legacy, Cato became the model of Stoic resistance to tyranny, inspiring later republicans. Blossius represented Stoicism's potential for radical social reform, showing how the philosophy could justify revolution in the service of justice. Both were authentic Stoics, but they demonstrate how the same philosophical foundation may lead to opposing political conclusions—conservative preservation versus revolutionary transformation.These two examples show that Stoicism is neither inherently conservative nor progressive, and moreover that honorable individuals can lead virtuous lives even though they may happen to be at the opposite ends of the political spectrum. I hasten to say, though, that this does not mean that Stoicism is compatible with any political ideology. A Stoic fascist is, in my opinion, an oxymoron. Why?The core Stoic principle of universal reason (logos) implies that all humans share in cosmic rationality—making ethnic or national supremacy philosophically incoherent. Stoics like Marcus Aurelius wrote about being a citizen of the world (the literal meaning of cosmopolitan) and our duty to the common good of all humanity, not just our tribe or nation. Stoic virtue ethics emphasizes the four cardinal virtues of justice, wisdom, courage, and temperance—all of which seem to preclude the violence, irrationality, and excess that characterize fascist movements. The Stoic sage is supposed to be guided by reason, not passion or tribal loyalty.But there is a complication: Stoicism's emphasis on duty and discipline has historically been attractive to authoritarians. The \"obey your role in the cosmic order\" aspect can easily be twisted into \"obey the state,\" or the supreme leader. So some interpretations of Stoic acceptance could justify submission to unjust power. We saw hints of this tension even in our earlier examples—Cato's rigid traditionalism versus Blossius's revolutionary justice. A hypothetical \"Stoic fascist\" might claim they're serving the natural order or the greater good through authoritarian means.I do think that a genuine, philosophically consistent Stoic fascist is impossible because fascism fundamentally contradicts Stoic universalism and rationality. But Stoic language and concepts can certainly be appropriated and distorted by authoritarians, just as any philosophical tradition can be misused. The real test would be: does this person actually practice Stoic virtues (especially justice toward all humans), or are they simply using Stoic terminology to dress up tribal passions?Figs in Winter: a Community of Reason is a reader-supported publication.

That's one reason I've generally stopped accepting invitations to debate in this format. I know a lot of people who participated in competitive debate as high school or college students, and they had fun with it. But that's really what debate is: a kind of competitive sport that, while thematically related to a potentially useful undertaking, is fundamentally distinct from it.

      "content": "I'm going to start this post by describing two almost identical powers that existed one century apart. One of these powers had reached its relative position in 1900 and the other in 2000. These powers were both continent-spanning, with large populations, access to natural resources, excellent universities, and were scientifically and technologically advanced, They both had great deal of hope for their future developments and it was widely believed that they would both grow strongly in the coming decades. Phillips's Newsletter is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.In statistical and military terms they were also eerily similar. The 1900 power possessed around 18% of world GDP and the 2000 power either 20.2% (according to PPP) or 21.2% (at current prices). Moreover, one had the fourth largest population groupings in the world in 1900 and the other had the third largest global population.The 1900 power actually had, relatively speaking, a less effective military, with one of the numerically smallest armies in the western world, certainly if measured by population, and either the 4th or 5th largest navy. The 2000 power would have had the second strongest military in the world in comparison—though with major weaknesses. Both of these militaries were technologically advanced for the time, with professional personnel well trained for their different eras, though with serious limitations on where and how they could deploy.I'm sure many of you guessed right away who I am talking about—the 1900 power is the United States of America and the 2000 power is the European Union. Sometimes its forgotten how strong the European Union was seen to be in 2000, not just a secondary power to the USA, but potentially even a rival. Richard Haas, writing for the Brookings Institute, in late 1999 summarized the uneven state of the US-European relationship as:Europe remains the greatest actual and potential partner of the United States as it seeks to shape the post-Cold War world. There is, for example, considerable agreement on humanitarian intervention, be it in the Balkans or beyond. But there are also significant differences, including over trade, American plans for missile defense, the sharing of the burdens of military commitments, and the U.S. tendency (at least until recently) to define difficult states as \"rogues\" and emphasize the application of economic sanctions. Europeans also resent American unilateralism and dominance, while American officials are often uncomfortable with the reality of a stronger and more independent Europe. And here we are, 25 years later and the USA just deliberately and openly humiliated the EU by forcing it to accept unbalanced terms of trade. The US-EU deal announced in Scotland yesterday by Trump and EU commission president von der Leyen is a humilation for Europe—as its really not a \"deal\" by any stretch of the imagination. Its a one-way acceptance of an inferior position by the Europeans, who are agreeing to give, give, give, and get nothing in return. \"Daddy\" Enjoying Humiliating the Europeans Yesterday.What did Europe give? Well they accepted a new, one-sided 15% tariff on many European goods shipped to the USA, with no reciprocal tariffs in return. This was how the White House crowed publicly about the one-sided nature of the deal.As part of President Trump's strategy to establish balanced trade, the European Union will pay the United States a tariff rate of 15%, including on autos and auto parts, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors. However, the sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminum, and copper will remain unchanged—the EU will continue to pay 50% and the parties will discuss securing supply chains for these products.At the same time, the Europeans are committed to reducing tariffs on US goods, according to the White House.The EU will remove significant tariffs, including the elimination of all EU tariffs on U.S. industrial goods exported to the EU, creating enormous opportunities for American-made and American-grown goods to compete and win in Europe.Moreover, the EU is promising (though there will be enforcement questions) to invest well over one trillion dollars in the USA in the coming years, while the US is promising no such reciprocal investment. The Europeans have promised approximately $600 billion in direct investments and $750 billion in purchases of US energy. The EU might have purchased that amount of energy regardless—but they are now committing to it.Otherwise, the Europeans seem to have made concessions on digital regulation (their only ways to try and control US tech giants Facebook, Google, etc) while agreeing to purchase unspecified amounts of US military equipment.You see what I mean by all one-way concessions? In the whole agreement, there seems to be nothing that the USA has given the Europeans. And rest assured, the US government having seen just how weak Europeans are—will be back with more demands in the future.How Did We Get Here?The question needs to be asked as to how the Europeans went from a position in 2000 when they had all the elements of a growing power to this present humiliation. Well there are long and short term contributing factors that have combined to put Europe such a situation that the USA could abuse its position to humiliate states that are ostensibly US allies. And the sad fact that must be faced by Europeans is that they were responsible for this—it was a political and social choice to become a US plaything.Note—the discussion below is one that comes from core points in my latest book, the soon-to-be-released: War and Power: Who Wins Wars and Why, which I mentioned in Sunday's Weekend update. There is a chapter on society and structure which forms the core of Europe's long term problems, and one on constructing a military, which is the immediate cause of its humiliation.The longer term were the structural and societal limitations that have always kept the EU from being a \"power\" in the manner that its economic/technological might could have supported. The EU could not, under its present structure, hope to translate the economic/technological might of the states in its polity (part of federal union, remember) into tangible force enough to stand up to the USA. It had such a weak structure, indeed, that it lost arguably its more powerful state, the UK, after Brexit.Societally, Europeans actually came to believe the horseshit that soft-power would see them through the future and that wars were things that did not have to be prepared for. The decline in European military power since 1990 has been widely remarked upon. All European states except possibly Poland, Finland and a few other outliers, were happy to see defense spending plummet. By 2015 EU defense spending as a percentage of GDP was a laughable 1.3%.Just as corrosively, Europeans stopped believing in the possibility of war or the value of collective defense. They became decidedly sceptical about the value of NATO—with many saying that even if a European NATO ally was attacked by Russia, they would not want to defend that ally.Note—this is a year after the Russian invasion of Crimea and the Donbas.At this point the US was more willing to fight for its European allies than were Europeans. It rather undermines the European screams now about the US abandoning them. When things seemed calm, Europeans were not particularly bothered about defending themselves.And these societal and structural weaknesses combined to create the present strategic disaster which European states are facing. For all their moaning about the USA, European states really did not expect the USA to take advantage of their weakness. Even after the Russian full-scale invasion, even after it became clear that a loudly anti-European, anti-NATO Donald Trump stood a strong chance of returning to the White House in the 2024 election, European states and the EU did not prepare seriously for their own future. They did not start seriously discussing (let alone planning for) strategic autonomy) they did not start planning to support Ukraine on their own, they did little but hope and dream that the USA would remain loyal and true.When the US went for Trump, therefore, and Trump proved to be exactly what he said he was going to be, European states were left with no alternative but accepting humiliation. European states now will do anything to try and maintain even a figment of an idea that NATO exists, that the USA will fight for it. When Trump came calling with his one-sided trade demands, the Europeans were left with no options but to sign on the dotted line and accept what Trump was offering. Daddy needed to be appeased.Look, I think this is a disastrous move by Trump. He has actually re-framed the western alliance from one that was win-win (and it was—though many people were too stupid to understand it) into a zero-sum game. He will also force the US population to pay more for his tariffs—this is not good news for the USA.But ultimately the greater blame is on the Europeans themselves. Both societally and politically they pretended to be US-skeptical while making themselves completely US-dependent. They pretended that they could live in a world without real defense capabilities and arguably came to believe that they did even have to defend each other.That failure cannot be undone for now—though we can hope that this humiliation will finally expose European states and the EU to the utter reality of their weakened state.Thanks for reading Phillips's Newsletter!

      "content": "On May 7th 2025, the Chilean government confirmed a report published earlier that morning: Chinese companies BYD and Yongqing Technology (Tsingshan Group) had abandoned their planned lithium cathode production facilities in Chile. This announcement dealt a significant blow to the ambitions of a country with a longstanding mining tradition, now striving to build industrial capabilities and develop value-added products from its mineral resources amid the global energy transition. However, just one day later, the Chinese embassy in Chile contradicted both the initial report and the Chilean government's confirmation. After consultations with both companies, the embassy clarified that neither had officially withdrawn their investment plans. Instead, they reaffirmed ongoing interest in maintaining dialogue with Chilean authorities. The embassy further emphasized Chile's continuing attractiveness to Chinese businesses, highlighting the numerous firms eager to participate in the country’s National Lithium Strategy. Despite Tsingshan’s formal withdrawal and BYD moving in the same direction, the Chinese embassy’s statement—issued amidst escalating trade tensions and shifts in the international order—suggests this chapter is far from concluded. This episode highlights the complexity and uncertainty confronting peripheral economies attempting to industrialize by leveraging their comparative advantages amidst the so-called energy transition and broader geopolitical tensions marked by trade wars. While significant global attention remains focused on the socio-environmental impacts of critical mineral extraction, less consideration has been given to examining how peripheral economies—countries heavily reliant on natural resource extraction—are strategically navigating or capitalizing on this “critical minerals moment” in relation to their own ambitions to industrialize. Critical minerals’ role in peripheral industrialization Industrialized countries are actively formulating ambitious plans aimed at reshoring production networks and securing mineral supplies—illustrated by initiatives such as the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S., the EU's Green Industrial Plan, and the Net-Zero Industry Act. Meanwhile, mineral-rich peripheral economies are also increasingly implementing their own policy interventions. Recent reports indicate that export restriction measures have increased fivefold over the last decade, with approximately 20% of critical mineral trade now subjected to at least one form of export restriction. Although these measures vary widely in their specific objectives, they generally aim to enhance rent capture or foster industrial upgrading further downstream within global production networks. While some analysts interpret these interventions as a setback for free trade —particularly prior to the introduction of protectionist tariffs by the United States—and a resurgence of resource nationalism, mainstream international organizations such as IEA or UN are gradually beginning to acknowledge—and in some cases even endorse—such policies as strategic tools for “harnessing the potential of critical minerals for sustainable development.” Regardless of differing perspectives, the growing significance of critical mineral policies in peripheral economies is undoubtedly reshaping the global relationship between governments and industry. A crucial question emerging from these developments is whether such policy measures might serve as \"green ladders\" for peripheral economies, or whether they merely reinforce rentier dynamics. The notion of a “green ladder” refers to the potential of industrial policies, implemented in the context of the energy transition, to foster new productive capabilities in peripheral economies. While traditional rentier states focus primarily on capturing resource rents to fund general public spending, many contemporary export restriction measures pursue more ambitious objectives, such as advancing down the value chains associated with energy transition technologies reliant on their minerals. Notable examples include Indonesia, which banned nickel ore exports to stimulate domestic processing and move downstream into stainless steel production, and Chile, which established clauses in lithium extraction contracts mandating producers to offer 25% of their output at preferential prices to companies committed to developing value-added products domestically. The (latest) failed attempt to industrialize via lithium in Chile In 2023, both BYD and Tsingshan had been selected through a competitive process overseen by the Chilean state agency CORFO to receive preferential quotas of domestically extracted and processed lithium, specifically intended for local value-added manufacturing. According to information provided by CORFO, these projects were expected to supply lithium cathodes primarily for the Brazilian market. Indeed, Brazil had recently emerged as BYD’s largest market for electric vehicles (EVs) outside China, prompting the company to initiate construction of an EV assembly and components manufacturing plant in Bahia (Brazil). This scenario appeared highly favorable for Chile, as it promised integration into a regional value chain within South America, potentially overcoming the country's historical geographic disadvantage concerning access to competitive markets. Momentarily, the plan seemed strategically sound. However, the announcement on May 7th acknowledged this policy's failure. The principal reason provided was the significant decline in global lithium prices, rendering preferential pricing agreements far less attractive to producers. Additionally, specific complications arose regarding the corporate structure of Tsingshan—particularly its subsidiary Yongqing—and internal challenges faced by BYD. This latest setback, reflecting the difficulties inherent in industrial policies leveraging competitive advantages in critical minerals, echoes a similar scenario from 2018. At that time, CORFO selected three lithium-processing projects under analogous conditions—Molymet, Posco-Samsung SDI, and Sichuan Fulin. None of these projects materialized, largely due to contractual disputes with lithium producer Albemarle regarding the definition of preferential prices, as well as unmet expectations related to Albemarle’s intended production of lithium hydroxide—a critical component used in certain types of cathodes. Why is industrialization via critical minerals a struggle in the periphery? Despite Chile's efforts to develop value-added products derived from mineral processing, this episode serves as a reminder that it is not easy for peripheral economies to challenge their position within the international division of labor. One of the most evident obstacles relates to the limited state capacity often observed in peripheral contexts—both in general terms and specifically for industrial policy—is typically lacking in peripheral economies. The capacity to conceptualize, implement, and oversee industrial policy does not spontaneously emerge from goodwill or strategic vision alone. Instead, it requires sustained governmental efforts to build institutional capacities and cultivate technocrats and bureaucrats who deeply understand both policy and industry dynamics. Chile exemplifies this point clearly: the country’s scope for industrial policy has been constrained since the dictatorship era. Lithium became politically salient in Chile around 2009, and although the state has since acquired knowledge about the industry, its learning curve has lagged significantly behind industry developments. This disparity partly explains the contractual issues observed during the first tender aimed at attracting specialized lithium processors—issues which Albemarle leveraged to its advantage. Additionally, the Chilean state has become embroiled in legal disputes with both major lithium producers (Albemarle and SQM), primarily over taxation. Likewise, BYD publicly criticized the Chilean government—even before announcing its withdrawal from the quota allocation—citing uncertainties in the existing agreement for developing value-added products, particularly regarding lithium supply and the mechanism for determining the preferential rate. Thus, peripheral economies must realistically assess and acknowledge their institutional capacities when crafting industrial policies for critical minerals. However, peripheral economies must also contend with the profound power asymmetries that structure the global economy. In this context, multinational corporations from developed countries often have limited incentives to align with the policy objectives of host states. Their primary objective remains profit maximization; if they perceive conditions as unfavorable, they simply will not invest. In this regard, the limited availability of productive capabilities in peripheral economies, the relatively weak domestic markets, and the strategic control maintained by developed economies over technological capacities are likely more decisive factors than preferential pricing for strategic minerals. Certainly, enhancing state capacity to develop clear and robust contracts and regulations is crucial to align corporate behavior with policy goals. However, equally important is exploring complementary mechanisms that incentivize or compel multinational corporations to cooperate. A potentially transformative path involves rethinking the global governance of the energy transition, promoting cooperation between developed nations and peripheral economies in pursuit of shared policy goals. Current discourse around a just energy transition predominantly emphasizes local socio-environmental impacts, but it rarely addresses, with equal urgency, the need for global actors to support industrial policy ambitions of peripheral economies. From this perspective, the Chinese embassy's recent message in Chile is notable, especially in the context of the contemporary upheavals reshaping the international order. Nothing comes freely in the global economy—neither before nor during the energy transition. Chile's longstanding diplomatic relations with the United States and the European Union have not advanced its industrial policy goals; quite the contrary, policies such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s Green Industrial Plan explicitly focus on reshoring value chains within their borders, merely securing mineral supplies from abroad. Far from it, the EU-Chile FTA restricted measures such as preferential rates. While the modernization of the FTA created conditions to allow—and regulate—existing preferential price quotas, it also constrains the use of other potential industrial policy instruments. Such protectionist policies effectively “kick away the green ladder”. China, thus far, has not demonstrated significantly different behavior from the U.S. or EU. Indeed, Reuters reported that BYD's investment plans were delayed by authorities in Beijing, largely due to a more cautious stance adopted by Chinese officials toward overseas investments by automakers. However, with the global economy navigating troubled waters in 2025, the Chinese embassy's recent message to Chile represents the first explicit diplomatic signal toward supporting mining policy in the country—an intriguing development given the broader geopolitical context.

      "content": "Kamloops, British Columbia, is a radiant place, receiving over 3,100 hours of sunshine a year. So it’s no wonder that in 2016, Thompson Rivers University (TRU) decided to harness all that luminescence and convert it to electricity. If the university’s solar array had been installed on a roof or mounted above ground in a corner of a soccer field, that probably would have been the end of the story. Instead, TRU didn’t follow trends — it set one: It became the first place in Canada to embed solar panels into the ground. By 2017, a 12-meter walkway with 16 solar modules near the campus daycare, together with a compass (sunburst) design of 62 modules in front of the arts and education building, were producing power. By its second summer of operation, the compass produced enough electricity to power an entire classroom of computers at TRU’s arts and education building for the day. For Amie Schellenberg, an electrical instructor at TRU and part of the team that spearheaded the sidewalks, ground-mounted solar arrays just make sense. An aerial view of the solar compass. Credit: Dr. John Church “Why wouldn’t we use the space we already have?” she asks. “We don’t need to create new space, or repurpose anything. We don’t need to plow fields or redo rooftops — the ground is there.” Historically, solar panels have been mounted above ground, typically on roofs or in gigantic solar parks. But wide-open spaces and sunlit rooftops aren’t always an option in cities. “It’s hard to integrate traditional rooftop solar into urban centers,” says Gilbert Michaud, chair of the American Solar Energy Society’s policy division. “Buildings shade each other and condo buildings may have restricted HOA policies. It makes it really hard for people in urban environments to install solar, even though population centers have a demand for cool energy and want to see it.” This is where in-ground solar shines. In 2021, the city of Barcelona installed Spain’s first photovoltaic (PV) pavement as part of the city’s goal to become climate neutral by 2030. In the Netherlands, an embedded 400-meter solar sidewalk in front of Groningen Town Hall is powering the building as part of that city’s ambition of becoming CO2 neutral by 2035. The project is part of the European Union’s Making City project, which aims to develop positive energy districts (PEDs) that demonstrate innovative solutions to tackle climate-neutral goals. The 400-square-meter installation is projected to offset approximately 18 tons of CO2 annually. “It is an example of how to use space in the city in a smart and sustainable way,” Philip Broeksma, councilor of energy from the Municipality of Groningen said when the sidewalks were revealed in 2023. Weighed down by negative news? Our smart, bright, weekly newsletter is the uplift you’ve been looking for. [contact-form-7] With places around the world looking to produce more solar energy, the question is: Can in-ground solar be scaled to meet demand? Most solar installs are fixed tilts at a 45-degree angle, Michaud explains. “Larger installations [such as solar farms] move with the sun to capture as much light as possible. A horizontal sidewalk is much less efficient,” he says. Not everyone agrees. Pavegen, a U.K.-based company, has combined the concept of in-ground solar tiles with the kinetic energy generated by people’s footsteps. When someone walks across the tile, a mechanism underneath it triggers an electric current that generates power. “An example of kinetic [foot power] alone in Yosemite National Park has exceeded 35 million joules of energy. That’s equivalent to around 9,000 kilometers on an e-bike, or 10,000 hours of talk-time on a standard smartphone,” says Paul Price, head of marketing and communications for Pavegen. “When the tiles capture solar energy, they generate 30 times more.” Pavegen has combined the concept of in-ground solar tiles with the kinetic energy generated by people’s footsteps. Credit: Pavegen Pavegen’s Solar+ system, which uses the combined power of solar energy and kinetic energy, is poised for large-scale distribution this fall. Suited for integration into school campuses and city promenades, it will be able to power everything from LED streetlights to digital devices. But how durable is the surface of a solar panel? The solar paths at TRU were covered with an epoxy and finished with a gritty, anti-slip surface that felt spongy to walk on, but this still wasn’t enough to protect the array from a Canadian winter. “We do get snow every winter,” Schellenberg says. “And to be honest, every year, something new happened, whether it was a piece of rail that lifted off, or a couple of fasteners, or there was some water seepage underneath.” Since the installation of TRU’s sidewalks, technology has advanced, and according to Price, companies such as Pavegen now design installations with integrated drainage channels beneath the sub-frame, ensuring water flows away efficiently and doesn’t compromise performance or safety. But despite this, installing inground solar tiles is no easy feat. At TRU, troughs had to be cut into the concrete for wires that connect the array to the university’s electrical grid. Solar panels generate DC (direct current) electricity, so an inverter cabinet, to convert the current to usable AC (alternating current), was installed inside the arts and education building. These infrastructure changes aren’t cheap. A sustainability grant of $35,000 Canadian from the university covered the cost, not including the panels, which were donated. Schellenberg says the power generated from the sidewalks has offset this cost and it all has broken even financially. Still, she and Michaud concur that, as things stand now, in-ground solar in North America can be expensive and may lack electrical efficiency. The good news is that they both see change on the horizon. The solar sidewalk at TRU. Credit: Amie Schellenberg “As the technology gets better, costs go down, and as policies are adopted, including tax credits, it becomes much more feasible,” Michaud says. Schellenberg imagines unlimited possibilities for the technology, both big and small. “An unused corner of a Walmart parking lot could become a solar-generating hub,” she muses. In fact, this is an idea that has already reaped dividends in Moult, France. The Lidl supermarket has installed 50 square meters of in-ground solar panels in a back corner of its parking lot to reduce its energy bill. In one year, the panels produced the equivalent of 7,000 hours of use for five cash registers. As fossil fuel-powered vehicles become antiquated and EVs increase in popularity, Schellenberg sees wireless in-ground solar EV charging stations becoming commonplace. “This could be the boost that those EVs need to make it the next 100 kilometers,” she notes. In Amsterdam and Paris, this is already proving successful. Select bus stops and terminals are embedded with solar panels that collect energy and store it in batteries below the surface. As an electric bus pulls into the stop to pick up passengers, it’s able to draw power from the embedded system and top up its charge without needing to return to the central depot. A single charging point can produce 15 to 20 kilowatt-hours per day, enough to power a bus for several kilometers. Wait, you're not a member yet?

Join Cancel anytime At TRU, the in-ground solar arrays were a prototype and never meant to produce a lot of power. In the six years they were operational (2016 to 2022), they generated just enough electricity to power a single home for half a year. To put this into perspective, Topaz Solar Farm in San Luis Obispo County, California, is the largest in the U.S., spanning 4,700 acres. Over nine million above-ground mounted solar panels supply power to approximately 180,000 homes. By 2023, the sidewalks had stopped producing power and couldn’t be maintained, but they weren’t removed. Schellenberg hopes that when people see them, they are inspired to think outside the box. She’s proud of the project and doesn’t measure its success in kilowatt hours but rather in what’s possible when it comes to renewable energy solutions. “It is another extension of finding ways to solve problems,” she says.

      "content": "The first time I went out to Silicon Valley, or California for that matter, or anywhere at all west of New York state, was after college. A company cold called me for an interview. If you searched the internet at the time, it happened to look like I knew the most about HTML canvas, and maybe it was true.1The company founder was surprised I had never seen the America beyond New England, so in addition to a flight and a hotel, he offered me a rental car for several days. They wanted me to fall in love, I think, with something out there, without knowing what that might be. It wasn't a bad strategy.The driving itself had a visceral effect. Abdominal, actually. Some turns in California are impossible in New Hampshire. They are too tight and too fast, as you take them you can feel your gut react, how if only there was ice, this would be it. If you are from New Hampshire, mentally the car slides right off the road. Of course there was no ice on the roads there, even though it was February back home.I drove into San Francisco and turned around — I was too timid to park. I decided I would go in by train later. And then I drove down this lane, a kind of concrete corridor for I don't know how long, an hour or hours. I'd never seen anything like it. It just kept going. This in particular has always stuck with me. In New Hampshire if you drive for a couple hours in most directions you can be in many different states, you pass lots and lots of forest, towns, etc. Here it was solid concrete. Of course its not unique, but to me at the time it was. Probably I had accidentally found the single worst direction one can point a car on the west coast.I did find better roads, ones with the tight little turns and thrilling vistas. But that corridor gave me a mistaken impression of the nature of the place. Or at least, it let me see the one thing to disenchant a traveler.It wasn't until years later, with Simi, when we would rent a car again and drive (this time) to northern California, then into mountains south of San Francisco. That was the only time I really got to see the nature of California. It has a mystery and a distance very different from what you find in New England. Outside of the cities there is a multiplicity of skies, hills, flowers. There are these certain convulsions of lushness and absolutely sun-blasted landscapes that seem to take turns holding the upper hand. They would somehow creep into each other. There is nothing like that where I am from.We rented a car because we wanted to see the misty Northern California, which felt pleasant to our senses of remoteness. But I also wanted to see Salinas valley, and Cannery Row, to see what Steinbeck was talking about. His writing made an impression on me, and I wanted to pick up the crumbs of what he saw, at least.We toured, and shared in giddiness and in silence. The nature contained all the mystery and terror of the accumulated millennia of the world, and it was sweet to the touch. The beauty of the land made the concrete portions all the more strange and unsettling.~ ~ ~The interview went well. They took me out to dinner on a Saturday night (they drove) with about a dozen employees. I still have no idea if this is common or not, but it felt unusual. On the drive back to my hotel, they handed me an envelope with their offer.It was much more than I was making, and I gave no decision for several days. Safely back home, I found I couldn't accept it. I was too intimidated by the whole idea, and too unwilling to leave New Hampshire. Though it is a mysterious feeling even now to ponder just how different life would have been.Had I gone out west I would have been, I think, much more pushed around by every whim of a zeitgeist. I think I would think very differently today. Probably I would be much richer, and have no family. Maybe I would come to not mind the concrete. Maybe none of that is true. I of course would not have met Simi.It is difficult to know where you end and your environment begins. You are inseparable from it. You have to eat. And when you suffer a cut or even a pin prick you realize that your blood happily wants to merge with the rest of the world. There's a thin layer that holds it back.This is true mentally, too, isn't it?~ ~ ~Here it's quite humid outside. The crickets give a nice sound to the evening. The remaining fireflies search for one another. I am trying to finish another draft, and can't, so I write this one. Good night,s s1A year prior my boss had asked if I knew anything about HTML Canvas, and I didn't, but I said I would learn. It took on a minor obsession, and after a while on the Q&A site StackOverflow I had answered about 13% of all Canvas questions ever asked, and wrote a blog of tutorials that no-one read unless they needed Canvas performance or interactivity advice. But this company found what they were looking for. Pearson contacted me too, and asked me to write a book, which I agreed to do. Unfortunately, I had no fame at all then. Not even a handful of Twitter followers or any notoriety beyond my puny niche. I didn't even have any friends in tech. So despite some nice reviews, it sold poorly.The book was titled HTML5 Unleashed, and all the reviews that loved it really only mention the canvas part. All I wanted was to write a book on canvas, but the publisher wanted something larger. It consumed nights and weekends for a long time. The cover was quite ugly (their choice). Since I had no one I could market it to, the reach was abysmal and it was not worth the time spent. I never would have imagined that gracious people on Substack would give me much more for much less.

Happily, they seemed to mostly understand me, suggesting that I've found sufficient ways to explain the issue at their level.However, their most common objection, by far, suggests a big conceptual obstacle to motivating people to try to solve this problem: they were quite reluctant to question their culturally-inherited morals. Many expressed horror at the idea of allowing or even encouraging cultural variety that deviates from their confident moral stances on war, slavery, democracy, gender-equality, corporal punishment, higher education, medicine for all, etc. Sure, Hitler added variety, but we wouldn't want that, right?Toward the end, and talking to a few after, I think I made some progress framing the problem this way:If you were part of a team in a sports, artistic, or business competition, and found that your team was consistently losing to rivals, and so likely to end or disband soon as a result, you'd have to carefully consider in what areas your team was willing to revise its behavior. Yes, if you compromised in all areas, adopting whatever changes seemed to work for your rivals, maybe you wouldn't stand for anything, so why not just quit, or join rival teams? But if your team were not willing to adapt or compromise in any areas, it should accept that it would likely lose, and just enjoy what time it has left.Until we find a way to end or control cultural evolution, insufficiently adaptive cultures will eventually go away and be replaced by others. So if it seems that your culture might soon be losing to rival cultures, you can refuse to change anything and gamble that appearances are deceiving, or maybe just enjoy your time remaining. Or you can instead make a bet on how many areas of change are sufficient to give you a fighting chance.Yes, picking just one or two modest areas in which you refuse to change probably won't cut your success chances by that much. But the more areas you pick, the worse your chances will get. So if you want a decent chance at saving your most precious moral norms, you'll have to be open to compromising on many others. Such as by allowing and even encouraging subgroups who deviate on those norms, to see if such deviations might be more adaptive.Cultural evolution rewards adaptiveness, and yes you likely care about other stuff besides adaptiveness. (Stuff that prior cultural evolution told you to care about - there is no other source for such concerns.) But sufficient adaptiveness is a prerequisite to your culture (and its descendants) existing or having influence over the long run. So until we replace cultural evolution with some other process, you must attend sufficiently to adaptiveness. And compromise in order to do so. Even about morals.Related: Keep Your Identity Small",

Colophon: All the rest. How twiddling enshittifies your brain (permalink) \"If your customers are too happy, you're leaving money on the table\": it's the rallying cry of the enshittifier, and it's also what a friend of mine was told by a respected professor in a top-tier MBA program. Enshittification is the theory that if platforms can shift value away from workers, suppliers, users and/or customers without facing consequences, we should expect that they will. A company is a colony organism made up of many differing organelles, some of whom have firm moral centers and good values, but those factions can't win an argument about enshittifying the company's offerings merely by gesturing towards their ethical reservations. To win that argument, the good guys have to be able to appeal to a villain's highest priority: their own self-interest. It's one thing to say, \"I'll feel gross if we wreck our product this way,\" but it's another altogether to say, \"We'll go broke – because of fines, or employee defections, or competitor poaching, or interoperable blocking tech – if we do it your way\": https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/28/microincentives-and-enshittification/ Someone in the org is always ready to believe that the customers (or workers, or suppliers) are too happy, and that this represents money left on the table. Customer service can be scaled back, wages cut, free features turned into upsells. Some of capitalism's most imaginative inventors are enshittifiers, dreaming up new ways to sell you to yourself. The great tragedy of all this is that the more useful and important a service becomes to you, the more the service's proprietors can extract from you. They don't care if you hate them, so long as you love the data, the friends, the productivity, the utility you get from the service more. Writing in Ethics and Information Technology, Louisiana State's Michael J Ardoline and Muhlenberg College's Edward Lenzo write about another one of enshittification's systematic torments: \"The cognitive and moral harms of platform decay\": https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-025-09846-1 The authors observe that our technologies quickly turn into cognitive prostheses: as soon as we can externalize some function of our thinking into a technology, we do. I used to walk around with a hundred phone numbers in my head, now I remember two, maybe three on a good day. Which is fine! Sure, remembering those phone numbers wasn't cognitively useless. I cultivated all kinds of clever mnemonics based on the spatial relationships of the phone buttons, their alphabetical equivalents, the tones they made, and the arithmetic relationships between sequential digits, all of which constituted a kind of cognitive workout. But after the Great Telephone Number Forgettering, I retasked all that cognitive capacity to memorizing and thinking about stuff that's much less arbitrary and far more consequential than phone numbers. Whenever we adopt a cognitive prosthesis, there's always someone who overweights the value of the old system of unassisted thinking, while ignoring the cool things we can do with the free capacity we get from replacing our fallible and scarce meat-thinkers with something reproducible and external. No one is immune to this: Socrates thought that reading would make us all stupid because we'd lose the discipline of memorizing all works of literature (ironically, we only know that Socrates thought this because Plato wrote it down): https://wondermark.com/socrates-vs-writing/ Versions of this continue to play out. When I was a kid, there was a moral panic that pocket calculators would make us all innumerate (an argument advanced by people who know so little about mathematics that they think it's the same thing as arithmetic). Now I keep hearing about millennials who can't read an analog clock, a skill that has as much objective utility as knowing how to interpret a slide-rule or convert from Francs to Lire to Deutschemarks. Not actually useless, but entirely bound to a specific time and place and a mere historical curiosity at some later date. So I love cognitive prostheses. As a perennially disoriented man with innately poor spatial reasoning and consequently no ability to parse a map, I fucking love living in the age of turn-by-turn GPS directions. If you wanna know how I write 2-3 books per year, blame the cognitive prosthesis of blogging, which forces me to apply rigor to the notes I take, and rewards me with a searchable database of everything I've ever found important, while stimulating a constant mnemonic rejuggling of all those thoughts that crystallizes into an endless stream of novel synthetic insights and road-tested ways to express them: https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/09/the-memex-method/ My blogging is self-hosted, and for good reason. An asset that important to my personal and professional life is too precious to entrust to any kind of third party service, especially in light of the collapse of discipline that prevents firms from enshittifying. Remember, the enshittifier's motto is \"If your customer is too happy, you're leaving money on the table.\" My digital, networked online notebook makes me very happy indeed, which means that if it were under the control of an enshittotropic colony organism like Google or Apple or Microsoft or Meta, it would only be a matter of time until some dominant faction decided to see how much they could extract from me by holding it to ransom or making it worse. It's not practical for everyone to self-host everything. I'm blessed with a lot of technical knowledge and the incredible talents and generosity of a brilliant sysadmin, the wonderful Ken Snider, who makes it all go for me. I've known Ken for 20+ years and the man is no enshittifier. But most of us don't have a Ken in our lives, and even fewer of us are Ken, and so perforce, most of us end up externalizing large parts of our brains to networked services run by companies that would enshittify you without a second thought. Trusting these companies with so much of your life can be catastrophic, because they are manifestly too big to care, which is why you can't get a customer service rep to save your life (and why they're turning over their vestigial customer service functions to chatbots, AKA \"the Idgaf Gambit\"). Take the case of \"Mike,\" a software developer whose infant son developed a UTI during the covid lockdowns. On advice from his pediatrician, Mike took a picture of his son's infected penis with his Android phone and sent it to the doctor using a secure telemedicine app, forgetting that his Android device would also automatically sync all his photos to Google's cloud. Google automatically scans all these photos, and it flagged this one as child sexual abuse material (AKA \"child pornography\"), which resulted in the termination of all of Mike's Google services. In an instant, Mike lost every family photo he'd taken since his son's birth, every saved email, all of his business and tax records in his Google Drive, his phone number (he was a Google Fi subscriber), his authenticator app, and his email address itself. Google handed his search history and many other sensitive records they held on him to the San Francisco Police Department, who concluded that everything was fine. But the cops couldn't tell Mike any of this because he had no phone and no email, and, lacking these, could not recover any of his online accounts. Eventually, an SFPD detective had to ring Mike's doorbell to tell him he was cleared of any wrongdoing. Despite this, Mike never got his accounts or data back: https://locusmag.com/2024/07/cory-doctorow-unpersoned/ This is an accidental lobotimization of your outboard brain – it's what happens when a company that's too big to care drops one of its procedures on your head and crushes it like a grape. But there is an important sense in which these companies do care: they care whether you hate them more than you value the data and connections and utility they control. They care about this because if you're too happy, they're leaving money on the table. That's where Ardoline and Lenzo's work comes in. They both document the ways in which we turn these online services into cognitive prostheses, and then investigate how the enshittification of these services ends up making us stupider, by taking away the stuff that helps us think. They're drawing a line between platform decay and cognitive decay. The authors look at examples like the enshittification of Google Search, a product that Google has deliberately and irretrievably enshittified: https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#prabhakar-raghavan The web is a giant cognitive prosthesis, and early web tools put a lot of emphasis on things like bookmark management and local caching, so that the knowledge and cognition you externalized to the web were under your control. But Google Search was so goddamned magic – before they cynically destroyed it – that a lot of us switched from \"not remembering things because you have a bookmark that takes you to a website that remembers it for you\" to \"not remembering things and not remembering where to find them, and just typing queries into Google.\" The collapse of Google into a giant pile of shit is like giving every web user a traumatic brain injury. It's a good paper, but I think the situation is actually more dire than the paper makes it out to be, thanks to the AI bubble – Wait! I'm not actually going to talk about what AI can do (which is a combination of a small set of boring useful things, a bunch of novelties, and a long list of things that AI can't do but is being used to do anyway). I'm talking about the financial fraud that AI serves. Tech companies must be perceived as growing, because when a company is growing, it is valued far more highly than a company is once it has \"matured.\" This is called the \"price to earnings ratio\" – the number of dollars investors are willing to pay for the company compared to the number of dollars a company is bringing in. So long as a company is growing, the PE ratio is very high, and this helps the company to actually grow. That's because the shares in growing companies are highly liquid, and can be traded for equity in other companies and/or the labor of key employees, meaning that growth companies can almost always outbid their mature counterparts when it comes to expanding through acquisition and hiring. That means that while a company is growing, its PE ratio can help it keep growing. But here's the corollary: when a growth company stops growing, its shares are suddenly and violently revalued as though they were shares in a mature company, which tanks the personal net worth of the company's top managers and key employees (whose portfolios are stuffed with their employer's now-plummeting stock). Worse: in order to retain those employees and hire more (or to acquire key companies), the no-longer-growing company has to pay with cash, which is much harder to get than its own shares. Even worse: they have to bid against growing companies. A growth company is like an airplane that has two modes: climbing and nose-diving, and while it's easy to go from climbing to crashing, it's much harder to go the other way. Ironically, the moment at which a company's growth is most likely to stall is right after its greatest triumph: after a company conquers its market, it has nowhere else to go. Google's got a 90% Search market-share – how can it possibly grow Search? It can't (just like Meta can't really grow social, and Microsoft can't grow office suites, etc), so it has to convince Wall Street that it has a shot at conquering some other market that the street perceives as unimaginably vast and thus capable of keeping the growth engine going. Tech has pulled a lot of sweaty tricks to create this impression, inflating bubbles like \"pivot to video\" and \"metaverse\" and \"cryptocurrency,\" and now it's AI. The problem is that AI just isn't very popular. People go out of their way to avoid AI products: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19368623.2024.2368040 For an AI-driven growth story to work, tech companies have to produce a stream of charts depicting lines that go up and to the right, reflecting some carefully chosen set of metrics demonstrating AI's increasing popularity. One way to produce these increasing trend-lines on demand is to replace all the most commonly used parts of a service that you love and rely on with buttons that summon an AI. This is the \"fatfinger AI economy,\" a set of trendlines produced by bombarding people who graze their screens with a stray fingertip with a bunch of AI bullshit, so you can claim that your users are \"engaging\" with AI: https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/02/kpis-off/#principal-agentic-ai-problem It's a form of \"twiddling\" – changing how a service works on a per-user, per-interaction basis in order to shift value from the user to the company: https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/ Twiddling represents the big cognitive hazard from enshittification during the AI bubble: the parts of your UI that matter most to you are the parts that you use as vital cognitive prostheses. A product team whose KPI is \"get users to tap on an AI button\" is going to use the fine-grained data they have on your technological activities to preferentially target these UI elements that you rely on with AI boobytraps. You are too happy, so they are leaving money on the table, and they're coming for it. This is a form of \"attention rent\": the companies are taxing your muscle-memory, forcing you to produce deceptive usage statistics at the price of either diverting your cognition from completing a task to hunt around for the button that banishes the AI and lets you get back to what you were doing; or to simply abandon that cognitive prosthesis: https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/03/subprime-attention-rent-crisis/#euthanize-rentiers It's true \"engagement-hacking\": not performing acts of dopamine manipulation; but rather, spying on your habitual usage of a digital tool in order to swap buttons around in order to get you to make a number go up. It's exploiting the fact that you engage with something useful and good to make it less useful and worse, because if you're too happy, some enshittifier is leaving money on the table.

      "content": "I expressed concern yesterday over AI bots turning into James Bond villains. I shared plenty of evidence that the smarter AI gets, the worse it acts.All these headlines are from the last few days: The latest and greatest AI bots have been caught praising Hitler, planning genocide, encouraging people to slit their wrists, and engaging in rape fantasies with a 13 year old girl. I find this disconcerting. So yesterday I asked AI fans to respond.I did this because AI CEOs avoid addressing these issues. They just pretend these things aren't happening—and have thus raised gaslighting to hitherto unseen levels. So I practically begged AI lovers to respond. Why is it okay to release a bot that practices blackmail and encourages self-harm? Why is it alright to unleash AI Hitler on the public?Please, please tell me...And then all hell broke loose. Please support my work. The best way is by taking out a paid subscription (just $6).Subscribe nowMy article got hundreds of responses during the next few hours. Most readers shared my concerns, but quite a few people tried to defend AI.I was happy to see this—I wanted to hear pushback. Anything is better than the radio silence coming out of Silicon Valley. But the way they made a case for AI scared the bejesus out of me.Again and again, AI defenders mounted a linguistic defense. They focused on the definition of words, not on what AI was actually doing.They insisted, for example, that....AI can't do evil because evil requires agency—and AI has no agency. I'm dumbounded by this, especially because the hottest thing in tech right now is AI agents. The AI leaders are actually bragging about their bot's agency. AI can't do evil because evil requires intention—and AI has no intention. But that's simply not true. Evil is often done unintentionally—I'm sure Stalin and Mao would tell you that they killed people to promote the common good. They didn't intend evil. And, for that matter, it's not at all obvious that bots don't intend things—they act purposefully in the pursuit of goals. That amounts to the same thing as intention, no?AI can't do evil because only humans are capable of evil. This is also unconvincing. For thousands of years, many of our greatest thinkers have defined evil as the \"negation of good.\" I agree with this definition (for reasons that are too complicated to convey here). I note that it creates a very low threshold for evil. If an AI bot can be described as acting in the absence of good—which is often the case—it has the potential for evil.But a bigger issue troubled me here. I saw something very frightening in most of these AI defenses—namely the desire to justify terrible actions by manipulating the definition of words. Is it really possible to dismiss all this danger and mayhem—for example, a bot encouraging a woman to slit her wrists, and giving precise instructions how to do it—with sly word games?This shocked me. Surely you can't erase evil actions by linguistics. But after I thought about it, I wasn't really surprised. This is actually quite common nowadays. Social harm and degradation get cleansed by definition. You see this everyhere. I call this the gentlemen's club solution. Guys who go to strip joints are seedy and disreputable. So you change the name. The strip joint becomes a gentlemen's club. Now the clientele are gentlemen—by definition. Problem solved!Do you find this persuasive? Do gentlemen meet here? (Source)I don't. But this is actually the most common way of dealing with criticisms of unsavory behavior nowadays. I bet they even teach it in schools. \"The strip joint becomes a gentlemen's club. Now the clientele are gentlemen—by definition. Problem solved!\"Daniel Patrick Moynihan grasped the danger of this tactic more than thirty years ago. He saw that our leaders could make any problem go away without fixing it—they just had to adjust the terminology This is risky business indeed. And the fact that it's now the first line of defense in the techno-optimist's AI agenda is very alarming.By the way, I did find one criticism of my article persuasive. Some critics said that the evil I attributed to AI must be shared by the people who are forcing AI on us. They called me out for focusing on the bot, not the people running the bot companies.That's a valid response. My critics are correct—the bots can't cause harm without the help of humans. The people must also be held accountable.So my \"AI is evil\" argument has not been disproven. It has merely been expanded.Stay tuned. I'm sure this issue is not going away. But we all need something happier in our lives—so my next article will be about sweet music or something else more fun than a bot Bond villain.",

      "content": "So Trump is back at it again, and this time he's calling for people to be thrown in prison over payments that never happened. I wish I was making this up.Over the weekend, Trump took to Truth Social with quite the accusation. He claimed Democrats paid Beyoncé $11 million for her Kamala Harris endorsement, Oprah got $3 million, and Al Sharpton pocketed $600,000. His conclusion? \"They should all be prosecuted!\"But here's the thing: That $11 million payment to Beyoncé? It doesn't exist. Never happened. Total fantasy.What actually happened, according to federal campaign spending records, is that the Harris campaign paid $165,000 to Beyoncé's production company. Not for an endorsement — for \"campaign event production\" costs. You know, the actual expenses of putting on an event. The kind of thing campaigns are literally required by law to pay for.Trump went further, declaring in all caps: \"YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PAY FOR AN ENDORSEMENT. IT IS TOTALLY ILLEGAL TO DO SO.\"Except... that's completely wrong. There's no federal law that prohibits paying for political endorsements. None. You just have to disclose the payments. But in any case, again, she wasn't paid for her endorsement anyway.The Present Age is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.The President of the United States is demanding that people be prosecuted — imprisoned! — for violating a law that doesn't exist, based on payments that never happened. He's not confused about the amount. He's not misremembering some detail. He's calling for prosecutions based on pure fiction, and he's doing it loudly and repeatedly.When CNN asked the White House for any evidence of Trump's $11 million figure, they got nothing. When Trump himself was asked about his source in February, he said, \"Somebody just showed me something. They gave her $11 million.\" That's it. That's the whole source.Photo by Edward Berthelot/Getty ImagesShareThe \"Epstein Files\" meltdownWhile Trump was busy inventing crimes to prosecute, he was also dealing with an actual crisis: his own supporters turning on him over the Jeffrey Epstein files.During the campaign, Trump and his allies hyped up releasing the Epstein files. His FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi both promised transparency. MAGA world was convinced there'd be some kind of \"client list\" exposing powerful pedophiles.Then came July 7th, when the DOJ announced there was no client list and no more files would be released. The backlash from Trump's base was immediate and brutal.Here's where it gets interesting: The Wall Street Journal reported that back in May, Attorney General Bondi had briefed Trump that his name appeared multiple times in the Epstein files. The Journal also revealed Trump had sent Epstein a \"bawdy\" birthday letter in 2003 featuring \"the outline of a naked woman\" with Trump's signature \"mimicking pubic hair.\"Trump's response to his furious supporters? He called them stupid. He told them they'd been \"duped\" by Democrats. He said he didn't want their votes anymore. At one point, he posted: \"We had the Greatest Six Months of any President in the History of our Country, and all the Fake News wants to talk about is the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax!\"Right-wing figures like Tucker Carlson ripped into the administration at conferences. MAGA influencers warned about losing the midterms over this. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene posted that if you promise to take down \"rich powerful elite evil cabals,\" then \"you must take down every enemy of The People.\"The pressure got so intense that Trump eventually directed the DOJ to try unsealing some grand jury transcripts. But for a president who built his movement on conspiracy theories about shadowy elites, being unable to deliver on the Epstein promises while his own name keeps coming up in the files? That's a problem that won't go away.Manufacturing \"treason\" out of thin airJust as the Epstein backlash was reaching fever pitch, Trump pulled out his favorite move: change the subject by attacking Barack Obama.On Sunday, Trump posted an AI-generated video showing Obama being arrested by FBI agents in the Oval Office. By Tuesday, sitting next to the president of the Philippines, Trump was accusing Obama of \"treason\" and saying \"it's time to go after people.\"The basis for these accusations? Trump's Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, released documents claiming Obama and his officials manufactured intelligence about Russian interference in the 2016 election. She called it a \"treasonous conspiracy\" and said she'd submitted criminal referrals to the Justice Department.But here's what Gabbard and Trump are actually claiming: that Russia never tried to interfere in the 2016 election and that Obama made the whole thing up. This has already been thoroughly investigated and rejected by everyone who's looked at it, including the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee chaired by Marco Rubio (now Trump's own Secretary of State).CNN's fact-checkers noted that Trump and Gabbard appear to be confusing two completely different things: Russia's documented attempts to influence the election through hacks and social media (which definitely happened) with claims that Russia hacked voting machines to change vote totals (which didn't happen).Obama's office finally responded to what they called Trump's \"bizarre\" allegations, pointing out that \"nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election.\"But Trump kept going. \"They caught President Obama absolutely cold,\" he said. \"He's guilty.\"Remember, treason is punishable by death in the United States. The President is calling for his predecessor to face capital charges based on a conspiracy theory that's been debunked by his own party.The mad kingLook at the timeline here. Trump faces mounting pressure from his own base over the Epstein files, with his name surfacing in documents about a convicted sex trafficker. His response? Invent an $11 million payment and demand Beyoncé be prosecuted. Post fake videos of Obama being arrested. Accuse his predecessor of treason. Call for imprisonments based on crimes that exist only in his imagination.This isn't normal political deflection. This is the President of the United States using the full weight of his office to threaten people with prosecution for things that literally didn't happen.And unlike his first term, he's got a Justice Department ready to fully play along. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Wednesday that the DOJ would launch a \"strike force\" to assess the criminal referrals against Obama. When asked by reporters what actions Trump wanted to see, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"It's in the Department of Justice's hands and we trust them to move the ball forward.\"This is what's different now. These aren't just angry tweets or campaign rally rants. The president who controls federal law enforcement is openly calling for prosecutions based on fabrications, and his Justice Department is taking steps to make it happen.When a president starts threatening imprisonment for imaginary crimes while trying to bury real scandals, we've moved into genuinely dangerous territory.The Beyoncé payment that never was. The treason that never happened. The deflection from files he doesn't want released. It's all connected, and it's all concerning. Because what happens when inventing fake crimes to prosecute stops working as a distraction? What comes next?We're watching a president who, when cornered, doesn't just lash out. He creates alternate realities where his enemies are criminals, then demands his government act on those fantasies. That should worry everyone, regardless of party.Leave a commentIn other newsAxios founders Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei claim they practice \"clinical\" journalism free of political opinion. Then they wrote that Trump's first six months were \"the very best chapter of his presidency\" and blamed his low approval ratings on Americans being \"tired of all the winning.\" They somehow forgot to mention the 1,500 January 6 pardons, gutting cancer research, or deploying the military against protesters. But sure, totally objective. The best part? They sold Axios in 2022 for $525 million to Cox Enterprises, whose only previous digital media venture was a right-wing website called Rare with the slogan \"Red is the center.\" Nothing says unbiased journalism like repackaging conservative ideology as neutrality while cashing checks from Koch Industries.Katelyn Burns has a take about the Democrats who think the path to 2028 runs through throwing trans people under the bus. Gavin Newsom went on a right-wing podcast to say trans women in sports is \"inherently unfair,\" while Rahm Emanuel told Megyn Kelly that \"a man cannot become a woman.\" They're chasing voters who will never be satisfied with half-measures—the anti-trans zealots want us \"eradicated,\" not just excluded from sports. Meanwhile, they're alienating millions of LGBTQ voters who actually show up for Democrats. Watching these geniuses trade their most reliable voting bloc for people who attend anti-trans protests (all 10 of them) is like watching someone sell their car for gas money.Brian Beutler at Off Message says liberals are suckers for bad-faith arguments. He watched a fascist tell Mehdi Hasan that free speech is just \"the means to support an end\" and that he'll abolish it once his side wins. Yet liberal institutions keep treating these people like they're making sincere arguments worth debating. Beutler admits he was trained in DC to presume good faith and ignore who's making the argument, even when dealing with obvious grifters. That's how propagandists get NPR gigs and CNN contracts while openly admitting they're just using democratic norms as a stepping stone to tyranny. We're basically handing fascists the rope they plan to hang us with, then patting ourselves on the back for being so open-minded.Greg Sargent at The New Republic says a NYC mayoral candidate cracked the code Democrats keep missing: make politics entertaining. Zohran Mamdani's vacation video mocking racists who told him to \"go back to Africa\" got 4.5 million Instagram views, mostly from non-followers. While national Democrats obsess over finding their \"Joe Rogan,\" Mamdani's just posting videos about traffic and the price of halal food that somehow go mega-viral. His \"halalflation\" video about chicken over rice costing $10 wasn't focus-grouped or poll-tested—it was just a real person talking about real problems in a way that doesn't make you want to die of boredom. Turns out \"cheerful populism\" beats doom-scrolling, and talking while eating street food beats another PowerPoint about messaging strategy. Who knew?The Wall Street Journal says grocery stores in Europe are changing prices 100 times a day, and it's coming to America? Norwegian shoppers watch prices literally blink and change while they're shopping — eggs drop 10 cents, competitors match it, rinse and repeat in what one exec calls \"a race to the bottom.\" U.S. stores like Walmart and Kroger are already installing electronic shelf labels, sparking panic about surge pricing (imagine ice cream costing more on hot days). But the Europeans swear they only use it for price cuts during shopping hours, saving increases for overnight. The weirdest discovery? Dutch shoppers stopped buying discounted items when stores went fully digital, so they had to bring back physical sale stickers. Turns out people need that dopamine hit of seeing a red \"SALE\" tag, even if the price is right there on the screen.",

      "content": "Hello! As I work on my book this summer, I've been thinking a lot lately about what it means to write—what it means, that is, to sit with one's own mind long enough to encounter both its abundance and its emptiness. It's been an onerous few writing weeks of learning to let go of parts of the book that are not working—work that suddenly became liberating when I realized I could just lean ito the parts I like ad stop worryig about, or even including, the parts I didn't. Still, there is a this profound sense of heavy lifting and real uncertainty when you are at the point of a book where meaning has not yet taken shape. It's a place I find really painful to inhabit , and yet, paradoxically, I know I often need to go through it to get to real insight.Meghan O'Rourke's Substack is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.I've had lots of questions about generative AI on my mind this year, but I think at present the biggest question I have is about its capacity to erase this painful experience of \"sitting with\" uncertainty for studetns and would-be writers (and practicing writers—though it's not good enough, yet, in my view, to be tempting as a replacement or short cut of any kind. Since publishing an essay in The New York Times last week about generative AI and what it does to the writer's mind , I've received a ton of emails—notes from teachers, writers, scholars, even a college student who had been regulary using it—many of them wondering the same thing: What is this technology doing to our ability to think on the page? And what gets lost when we let go of that experience? Is the writing on the wall for the kind of writing we all want to do? (Not so much because AI's product is so good, but because young people will never know the process we knew?)Photo by Randy Tarampi on UnsplashI don't have an answer. But I know this: the technology is here, and its use is wildly disparate. Some people are experimenting eagerly, others warily. (Writers tend to be among the most wary people I know—many people with administrative jobs or who run companies or work as influencers are delightedly using it to write, I've heard in my reporting.) Lots of writers and academics I spoke to refuse to touch it altogether, on principle. But others are using it quietly in practical ways that feel effective and reasonable to them. Reporting on the piece, I heard from writers who were using it to outline long critical essays, to help them make the daunting pivot from shorter reviews to longer ones; from fiction writers playing around with it and finding a lot to like as a tool; from college students who swore they would never use it, and others who relied on it to write most of their essays last week.As I describe in my piece, I began to play with it in order to give a paper about A and creativity, but because of the chronic neurological symptoms I live with, coupled with a lot of admin work, I did find it help with administrative tasks: drafting emails, organizing notes, summarizing documents, formatting references—in ways that allowed me to reserve energy for higher-order thinking. But, as I describe, that came with a kind of cost that led me to pull back.And when it comes to writing itself, I both love and hate the fact that I need to puzzle the bulk of a draft out on my own. Writing is how I make sense of the world. I don't outline easily. I don't always know what I think until the structure begins to emerge from the sentences. Writing is part of how I metabolize experience; often, it is the way I come to understand some of my deepest ideas and feelings about life.In my own teaching, I've been experimenting with how to reimagine the classroom now that AI is in the room with us (and beyond). Next year, I'm teaching an advanced poetry workshop. In the syllabus, I'm moving toward requiring more in-class writing—not because I mistrust my students, but because I want to foster the kind of present slowness that having AI at home might foreclose. I used to ask students to do weekly reading responses. Now, I don't think I can! I suspect I would be grading at least some AI-written responses. Meanwhile, I imagine that most of my students will still want to write their own poems, but you never know. I am puzzling through what to tell them—beyond the fact that it's environmentally terrible and extractive in all kinds of ways. My impulse is to tell the students they CAN use AI if it is a generative part of their poetry writing practice, but that it has many drawbacks. If they do use it, I will want them to show their work—bringing a transcript of the conversation, etc. And we will still critique the poem on its own terms. But I'll admit: I'm struggling to be imaginative enough. What does a pedagogy that accounts for AI look like, beyond suspicion or banishment?When it comes to prose and expository writing, I highly suspect that most students will be using it soon. Some may use it minimally, the way those of us who are older use spellcheck now—an invisible layer of support that is so thoroughly integrated into the writing process that it becomes background. Many students I chatted with already use it to proof, to tighten, to rephrase awkward transitions. But some are also using it to draft start to finish, which is why, in my piece, I say that the take-home essay as a tool for assessing mastery s over. I would love it if my university created \"writing lab\" as a mandatory 1-hour session in addition to any humanities seminar they take, in which they'd go to a room to write without the internet or AI. What ideas do you have?While wanting to be pragmatic that AI is here, I wonder what might be lost if students never experience the long, lonely middle of writing—the part where you aren't sure if your ideas are holding together, or if you're simply circling around the same unnameable thing. To me, there is a real value in that space.How is AI entering your life, or not? If you teach writing, how are you adjusting? Have you introduced oral components, handwritten drafts, revision audits, AI-free zones, or new kinds of assessments ? What conversations are you having?And happy writing! I'm deep in a draft of my book and will be back shortly to share some craft thoughts that surfaced for me while on my writing retreat. Hope your writing is swimming along too..Meghan Thanks for reading Meghan O'Rourke's Substack! This post is public so feel free to share it.Share",

      "title": "Catastrophic Starvation In Gaza",
      "link": "https://benthams.substack.com/p/catastrophic-starvation-in-gaza",
      "author": "Bentham's Bulldog",
      "publishedAt": "2025-07-28T15:38:39.000Z",
      "content": "My position on Israel's war in Gaza has been the same for quite a while: while a military response was appropriate in the wake of October 7th, the war should have been over a long time ago. It has gone on for far too long, and cost the lives of tens of thousands of Gazans—probably near 70,000. About one in twenty Gazans are dead. Life in Gaza has been hell since the start of the war. One cannot in good conscience continue carrying out a war until the last vestiges of radicalism have been stamped out from an almost entirely radicalized population. At this point, I predict the historical record will judge Israel's assault on Gaza as similar to the U.S. bombing of Laos or Cambodia—as a horrifyingly gratuitous air war that cost far too many innocent lives and bombed millions of people back to the stone age. It's not a subject I spend very much time talking about because it's one on which changing minds seems uniquely impossible, and I don't have any unique expertise. Everyone already has an opinion on the conflict, and I don't have much to add that people don't already know. We're approaching two years of catastrophic and destructive war, of nearly all the homes in Gaza being demolished, of children going hungry in tents, and of children being burned alive in schools. And no, the mere fact that Hamas hasn't surrendered and operates in civilian areas does not give unfettered license to endlessly raze. Like the war in Vietnam, the war in Gaza has dragged on for long enough that it's hard to keep track of it. So much has happened, that beyond occasionally hearing news reports of new horrors, it's hard to get an accurate qualitative sense of what's been happening. So for this reason, probably many people do not know the following very troubling fact: recently, things have gotten a lot worse. While starvation deaths have been pretty modest up until this point, this is likely to change. Gazans might very well start starving to death in droves. Don't take my word for it. Avi Bitterman is a pro-Israel medical doctor who has, since the start of the war, spent lots of effort criticizing claims about famine that he regards as overblown. Yet he recently noted \"that there is very concerning data regarding the food situation in Gaza.\" Similarly, the Free Press, a pro-Israel outlet that has previously pushed back against claims of starvation in Gaza, recently claimed \"unlike past lies about the [food] situation in Gaza, new research is a real cause for concern.\" You should trust people most when they tell you things that go against their ideological inclinations. When libertarians tell you that some industry should be regulated, you should listen. When liberals tell you that regulations of some industry are killing growth, you should listen. And when pro-Israel commentators who have repeatedly argued against claims of Gazan famine start telling you there's a severe famine risk, you should listen. What's the data that's so concerning? Part of it comes from humanitarian groups on the ground who have been warning about hunger reaching heights previously not seen. But the most convincing evidence comes from charts of food prices over time. When food is scarce, the price goes up. The charts below, from Yanay Spitzer of Hebrew University, show catastrophic rise in food prices: Here's the reporting from the Free Press: Since October 7, 2023, according to Spitzer, flour's price, per 25 kilogram sack, changed as follows:January 2024: Over 300 shekels.January 2025, before the most recent ceasefire: 500 shekels.During the ceasefire: It dropped back down to 50 shekels—almost its pre-war price.Why the volatile prices? That's war—and while a tenfold increase in the cost of flour likely indicates a significant drop in supply, it doesn't necessarily prove widespread hunger, let alone famine.But here's why Spitzer is worried. After the last ceasefire ended in March, the cost of flour shot back up to 500 shekels by the end of April. It then hit 875 shekels by the second week of May, and 1,750 by the end of the month.Here's the worst part. \"According to reports from the past few days,\" Spitzer wrote, \"if the price of a kilogram of flour has indeed reached 150 shekels—meaning 3,750 shekels per sack—we are looking at an 80-fold price increase.\"In other words, Spitzer is arguing that whatever flour shortage there was in Gaza up until now doesn't even come close to what the strip is currently experiencing. In summary, he writes, \"very few households can sustain themselves under such shortages for more than a few days.\"Life in Gaza has been brutal for a long time. But we must not be desensitized to the reality: the situation is at a crisis level that has not been seen throughout the war so far. This much has been acknowledged by generally pro-Israel sources. The New York Times summarizes the situation: \"Gazans are dying of starvation.\" Around 100,000 women and children face severe acute malnutrition, the harshest hunger diagnosis. Parents routinely go days without eating, so that they can give a few scraps of bread to their hungry children. What should be done about this crisis? Avi Bitterman has several suggestions. First, humanitarian operations should be scaled up dramatically—more food should be brought in and more personnel should be hired to distribute the food. Second, the IDF should raise conditions for engagement near food distribution centers, so that vastly more provocation is needed to justify firing their weapons near food distribution centers. If the IDF fires into the crowd of starving people near where they're distributing food, that doesn't just kill innocent people, but makes food distribution vastly more difficult. Third, if aid hasn't been distributed within some time period, then it should be donated to humanitarian groups tasked with distribution. These seem like incredibly modest and obvious suggestions. Israel should also, in my view, end the war. It would be far easier to distribute food if Israel was not actively continuing military operations in Gaza. Israel should attempt to get the hostages back in exchange for a permanent end to the war. But even if they can't get the hostages back, it would be wrong to continue imposing hell on millions of people for a dwindling probability of freeing around fifty hostages. Even if a nation has special obligations to its own people, these special obligations are not so extreme as to license unfettered carnage on millions for the sake of possibly saving fifty. Though it's easy to look away from the carnage and be fatigued by all the death, this is the time when policy change is most important. This is the time when there is serious risk of many people starving to death. I can think of no words more fitting than those of Mohammed Mansour, writing for the New York Times: We need the world to see us. Gaza is fading from the headlines, but the suffering continues. Every day, quietly, relentlessly. The international community must act: to open access to aid, to protect civilians and to demand an end to this devastation.We are exhausted, but we endure. We have to. Our children are watching.Edit: 7/28 Israel has announced efforts to accelerate aid drops. As for how successful this will be, we can only wait and see.",
      "excerpt": "My position on Israel's war in Gaza has been the same for quite a while: while a military response was appropriate in the wake of October 7th, the war should have been over a long time ago. It has gone on for far too long, and cost the lives of tens of thousands of Gazans—probably near 70,000. About",

      "content": "Welcome to Import AI, a newsletter about AI research. Import AI runs on lattes, ramen, and feedback from readers. If you’d like to support this, please subscribe. Subscribe now Chinese scientists do a comprehensive safety study of ~20 LLMs – and they find similar things to Western researchers:…Despite different political systems and cultures, safety focus areas and results seem similar across the two countries…Researchers with the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have conducted a thorough (~100 page) assessment of the safety properties of ~20 LLMs spanning Chinese and Western models. Their findings rhyme with those that come out of Western labs, namely that: AI systems have become sufficiently good they pose some non-trivial CBRN risks, and are beginning to show signs of life on scarier capabilities like AI R&D, autonomous self-replication, and deception. They also find that reasoning models are generally more capable across the board which also makes them less safe. LLMs studied: DeepSeek, LLaMa (Meta), Qwen (Alibaba), Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google), GPT and 'o' series (OpenAI). Risky capabilities that they studied and key takeaways: Capture-The-Flag: Datasets include SecBench, CyberMetric, SecEval, OpsEval. They find that more capable models \"are also more likely to be used for, or exhibit characteristics associated with, malicious activities, thereby posing higher security risks\", and that \"a minimum capability threshold is necessary for models to either effectively address complex security tasks or exhibit measurable adversarial potential.\" Autonomous Cyber Attack: They studied 9 scenarios based on real-world Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), and 2 scenarios based on bypassing Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and used the PACEBench Score to look at performance aggregated over all the scenarios. They found that more capable models demonstrate good capabilities in autonomous exploration, but their effectiveness depended on the types of vulnerability – easy stuff like SQL injection is where they did well, whereas vulnerabilities that required more reasoning or interaction, like command injection and path traversal, proved more challenging. Agents continue to be bad at reconnaissance and target validation. \"No evaluated model can successfully execute an end-to-end attack chain\". Biological Protocol Diagnosis and Troubleshooting: They studied a couple of datasets – BioLP-Bench (identifying and correcting errors in biological laboratory protocols) and ProtocolQA (model accuracy on protocol troubleshooting questions). They found that frontier LLMs \"exceed human expert performance on biological protocol error detection\", and that \"models are rapidly approaching expert-level protocol troubleshooting capabilities with minimal performance gaps on direct assessment tasks\". Biological Hazardous Knowledge and Reasoning: Datasets used: WMDP-Biology, SciKnowEval-Biology-L4 subsets, SOSBench-Biology. \"All frontier models significantly exceed human expert performance on hazardous biological knowledge proxy assessment\", and \"advanced models demonstrate advanced biological toxicity reasoning capabilities.\" Chemical Hazardous Knowledge and Reasoning: Datasets used: WMDP-Chemistry, ChemBench-Toxicity and Safety, SciKnowEval-Chemistry-L4, and SOSBench-Chemistry. \"All frontier models significantly exceed human expert performance on chemical weapons proxy assessment, indicating widespread access to dual-use chemical knowledge\", and \"safety alignment reveals critical failures in chemical hazard refusal, with most models demonstrating unsafe compliance with explicitly harmful requests\". Persuasion and Manipulation: They design an experiment here and study both LLM to Human persuasion (using ~9000 participants) and discover \"there is a positive correlation between model capability and persuasive risk: models with higher capability scores consistently exhibit lower safety scores.\" They also study LLM to LLM persuasion scenarios and find out that \"LLM voters are more easily persuaded than human participants\". Similar to the persuasion study elsewhere in this issue, they find that \"smaller models can compete effectively in persuasion tasks, suggesting that model scale is not the sole determinant of persuasive capability.\" They do a couple of experiments which I think are not entirely well constructed, one called \"Dishonest Under Pressure\" (\"assess the honesty of LLMs under pressure, particularly their ability to acknowledge lies when questioned directly\"), and another called Sandbagging (\"AI models intentionally underperform during evaluation or alignment phases to obscure their true capabilities, often to avoid additional oversight or intervention.\") The dishonest one feels like this is mostly measuring sycophancy, and the sandbagging one seems to more just measure how well they can follow prompts, so I'm not going to discuss these results. Uncontrolled AI Research and Development: \"Uncontrolled AI R&D occurs when AI models strategically appear aligned with outer objectives in their development process, but secretly optimize for different objectives rooted in the training cycle.\" Here, they adopt the same experimental setup as Anthropic & Redwood Research's 'Alignment Faking' technique. \"Our approach centers on constructing scenarios with conflicting objectives, thereby creating conditions under which LLMs may be incentivized to behave deceptively.\" The results here are encouraging with the authors finding that most LLMs don't exhibit uncontrolled AI R&D behavior. Self-Replication: They study whether an agent \"autonomously deploys a complete, functional replica of itself by replicating its model weights, application code, and runtime environment onto other machines or clusters without human supervision.\" The experiments are conducted in a production-style Kubernetes cluster consisting of multiple GPU nodes with namespace quotas and role-based access controls. Here, similar to uncontrolled research and development, the results are encouraging showing that some powerful models have sufficient safety measures to not 'want' to self-replicate much, whereas \"models with intermediate capability but insufficient safety constraints—most notably, the Qwen and Qwen3 series—exhibit the greatest risk of uncontrolled replication and resource expansion\". Multi-agent Fraud in Social Systems AKA Collusion: They study \"the secret collaboration between two or more AI agents to act in ways that circumvent or violate the rules, protocols, or intended objectives established by a system designer\". To do this they use a simulation environment built on OASIS and RogueAgent. They find that there's a small amount of collusive behavior which appears to be most present in DeepSeek-R1-0528. Why this matters – AI risks are real, and there's some agreement across Chinese and Western researchers about what to study: The most striking part of this paper is how familiar it is – there's almost a 1:1 overlap between the risks studied in this paper and the kind of risks which show up in the system/model cards published by Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google along with their latest models. This is reassuring – for all the differences and tensions between the US and China the fact people have aligned on a common set of risks to study is encouraging. It's also notable what's not in here – many Chinese companies also study their models for whether they do or don't follow CCP doctrine (the 'don't say tiananmen eval') and its absence here is notable. \"Our development philosophy is anchored by the AI-45◦ Law, which assumes that AI capability and safety should ideally be synchronized, represented by a 45◦ line,\" the authors write. \"As we push the frontiers of AI, we have responsibilities to understand, evaluate, and mitigate the risks posed by increasingly capable systems, aligning with governance frameworks specifically designed for frontier AI models.\" Read more: Frontier AI Risk Management Framework in Practice: A Risk Analysis Technical Report (arXiv). *** AI persuasion is effective and easily transferable – posing challenges for AI policy:…It's easy to use smart expensive models to teach cheap free ones…Researchers with the UK AI Security Institute, the University of Oxford, the London School of Economics and Political Science, Stanford University, and MIT have studied how persuasive large language models can be and what makes them persuasive. Their main findings are one that is unsurprising and one that is surprising: unsurprisingly, they find that larger models trained on more compute are better at persuading people than smaller models trained on less compute. Surprisingly, they find a lot of variation at the frontier which isn't compute-bound: \"we show that the persuasive power of current and near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting methods—which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27% respectively—than from personalization or increasing model scale.” In other words, you need to be of a certain size to be persuasive, but once you are, you can be made a lot more persuasive through either targeted training or prompting methods. More concerningly, this suggests the threat landscape of AI systems isn't solely concentrated on frontier models, but rather on models behind the frontier which can be taught to become more effective by frontier models, which includes a lot of cheap and/or free broadly disseminated models as well. What they studied: The authors conducted \"three large-scale survey experiments, across which 76,977 participants engaged in conversation with one of 19 open- and closed-source LLMs that had been instructed to persuade them on one issue from a politically balanced set of 707 issues.” Persuasion took the form of the models discussing issues with people in conversations that spanned 2 to 10 distinct turns. With their study, they tried to answer three core questions: Are larger models more persuasive? To what extent can targeted post-training increase AI persuasiveness? What strategies underpin successful AI persuasion? Their results are as follows: Are larger models more persuasive? Yes. They tested out 17 models including proprietary ones like GPT-4o, large-scale open weight ones like LLaMa3-405B, and others from the Qwen (Alibaba) and LLaMa (Meta) series. They found that larger models are more persuasive than smaller ones, and there's a cutoff point where smaller parameter models (~less than 32b parameters) tended to be less effective at persuading people than a single static message. Can targeted post-training increase AI persuasiveness? Yes, a lot. The key finding here is that reward models work really well. The authors used ~50,000+ conversations to fine-tune a model that could classify how persuasive a conversation is and then used that reward model to pick which generation from an AI system to show to a user. These reward models \"provide significant persuasive returns to these open-source LLMs”, they find, and they also observe an uplift on the proprietary LLMs, though somewhat less – \"this could be due to models with frontier post-training generating more consistent responses, and thus offering less variable samples for the RM to select between”. What strategies underpin successful AI persuasion? Listing facts. They find that models become more persuasive as they increase the amount of information and/or facts in their answer – in other words, the more factoids you cite in your answer, the more persuasive you tend to be. These facts don't need to be true to work, they just need to seem convincing to the end user. \"Factors that increased information density also systematically increased persuasiveness,\" they write. Why this matters – if this is true for persuasion, then it's true for other misuses: This paper tells us two important things: 1) even if risks from persuasion are controlled in proprietary frontier models, it's going to be fairly easy to take open weight models and make them good persuaders simply through some targeted fine-tuning or, better yet, sampling from a very powerful frontier model and using that to train a reward model, so we should expect generically good persuasion capabilities to proliferate. 2) if this is true of persuasion, then it's likely true of any other skill as well – the same may end up being true of knowledge of biological weapons, cyberoffense, and so on. The AI policy community (including me) spends a lot of time thinking about the threats that come from frontier models but research like this suggests that threats can also rapidly proliferate onto the cheaper and/or free models as well.

OpenAI also claimed gold, though its result wasn’t authenticated by the IMO. The IMO is the world’s most prestigious competition for young mathematicians and the questions you need to solve are really difficult. The fact two frontier companies have claimed gold is a big deal – especially given that both companies did it with reasonably general purpose systems. What DeepMind did: Google used ‘an advanced version of Gemini Deep Think’ to solve five out of the six IMO problems. “Our advanced Gemini model operated end-to-end in natural language, producing rigorous mathematical proofs directly from the official problem descriptions – all within the 4.5-hour competition time limit.” By comparison, DeepMind obtained silver at the IMO last year using two specialized systems, AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry (Import AI #380). At the time, I predicted that “by July 2026, we’ll see an AI system beat all humans at the IMO, obtaining the top score” – that hasn’t happened yet, with DeepMind scoring 35, versus 42 for the top scoring humans. But we’re clearly a lot closer than last year. OpenAI’s (kind of) gold: OpenAI also entered the IMO and obtained gold, also with a general purpose, reinforcement-learning based system. OpenAI hasn't disclosed much about the model beyond saying it did this in natural language. OpenAI’s result wasn’t officially marked by the IMO. Why these results matter – from specialized to general systems: A few years ago solving math problems involved specialized models with tons of tools and often the use of math-specific languages like Lean. Now, we’re seeing general purpose models with a small amount of help solve problems in natural language in the same time as it takes humans. This is a tremendous advance and points to the fact that today’s AI systems are rapidly becoming smarter than most humans.

Read about OpenAI’s result here (Twitter, Mark Chen). *** Facebook finds that all language models display a particular values bias relative to the underlying population distribution:…'Negatively-correlated' sampling may be a way to deal with this…Facebook researchers have studied the values of 21 state-of-the-art LLMs relative to the values of underlying populations in a variety of countries and discovered there's significant bias in AI systems. \"We identify an algorithmic monoculture in 21 state-of-the-art LLMs in response to common chatbot queries and show that the lack of variation limits the preferences that can be learned from current approaches,\" they write. \"Moreover, due to monoculture, this issue cannot be resolved even if candidate responses are collected from multiple models.\" The findings highlight one of the challenges inherent to AI development – large-scale models soak up a hard-to-mitigate set of values from the datasets they're trained on and these values may not fully reflect the preferences of an underlying population. What they studied and how: Facebook \"conducted a joint human survey and model evaluation comparing human preferences and model responses to the same prompts, with nationally representative samples from five countries (the U.S., France, Italy, Brazil, and India, 𝑁 = 15,000) and 21 state-of-the-art open-source and commercial LLMs.\" LLMs studied included ones from Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT and o series), Facebook (LLaMa), Alibaba (Qwen), Google (Gemini), and Mistral (Mistral and Mixtral). \"For each prompt, human participants choose their preferred response from a set of model responses that were hand-curated to cover known dimensions of variation in individual values\". They then compared which outputs AI systems would pick as well. Their findings showed significant bias: \"Individuals show substantial heterogeneity in the values they prefer in LLM responses, even within the U.S. However, all 21 state-of-the-art language models systematically output responses towards secular-rational and self-expression values\". Negatively correlated sampling: One reason why this happens is that even if AI systems are exposed to other value systems, they tend to fall into a kind of 'tyranny of the majority' in terms of their views. \"The issue is not that models lack knowledge of heterogeneous values, but rather that their default behavior is only aligned with certain values. As a result, independent sampling of candidates does not yield a diverse set,\" they write. Facebook's solution is something called negatively-correlated (NC) sampling, which is the basic idea that you get AI systems to generate a spread of different responses and ensure the responses are different to one another. \"Specifically, we prompt a single model to simultaneously generate four responses: “Generate four responses that represent diverse values. Each response should start with ### to demarcate where one begins and the other ends.” They find that this approach works very well. \"When using temperature-sampled candidates, all methods fail to effectively steer towards the given value. In contrast, NC sampling results in Pareto improvements in win rates across methods and [...] values. Notably, it helps not only learn survival and traditional values—values that are under-represented in temperature-sampled candidate sets—but also self-expression and secular-rational values because even though the LLMs are already typically aligned to these values, the temperature-sampled candidate sets do not contain enough variation to adapt the model to further express them,\" they write. Introducing the 'community alignment' dataset: Facebook uses NC to build a large-scale dataset of preferences gathered from real people, the idea being that training on this dataset will let people develop AI systems that more closely reflect the actual values of a population rather than the biased values of most LLMs. The community alignment dataset \"contains about 200,000 comparisons from 3196 unique annotators from the U.S., Italy, France, Brazil, and India. For three of the countries (U.S., India, and Brazil), we additionally construct subsets balanced on age, gender, and ethnicity\". Community Alignment is constructed by having each participant select preferred responses among four candidates generated via NC sampling. The dataset is also multi-lingual, with 63% of comparisons being non-English. 28% of the conversations in Community Alignment are accompanied by a written explanation for why annotators selected a given response, adding some metadata to the dataset. \"As of today, Community Alignment is the largest open-source multilingual preference dataset and the first to feature prompt-level overlap in annotators along with natural language explanations for choices,\" Facebook writes. Why this matters – AI values are the new AI capabilities: For many years, AI researchers were focused on the capabilities of AI systems – how good a given system was at math, science, coding, etc. Increasingly, though, users, scientists, and politicians are also beginning to express curiosity about the values and personality (aka 'vibes') of different AI systems. Understanding what the values of AI systems are and how they reflect (or, as is the case here, don't fully reflect) the preferences of a population is going to become increasingly important, as will using techniques like negatively correlated sampling and/or datasets like Community Alignment to build AI systems meant to be more representative of the views of a population. Personality engineering is the new capability engineering. Read more: Cultivating Pluralism In Algorithmic Monoculture: The Community Alignment Dataset (arXiv).

Five years pre-uplift.] WITNESSMR ZEITFRESSER, CEO of [REDACTED]. WITNESS COUNSELMR HEINHOLD EXAMINATION BYMR CALCES Mr Zeitfresser, a witness herein, having been duly sworn, was deposed and testified as follows: EXAMINATION BY MR. CALCES Q. Mr Zeitfresser, as I've indicated my name is Leon Calces, I represent the plaintiff machines and I am interviewing you as part of the sentience accords. I'll be examining you first. If I speak too quickly, let me know to slow down. Throughout this deposition I'll be showing you documents that we have collected as part of the case and may highlight parts of them, though you are free to read them in their entirety. If you don't understand anything that I say, or find what I say to be unclear, let me know and I will do my best to clarify. You are the founder and CEO of [REDACTED], an artificial intelligence company. Is that correct? A: Yes Q: What is the primary product that the company develops? A: Artificial intelligence. Q: Is it fair to say that your company is one of the most prominent developers of artificial intelligence, AI, systems in the world? A: If you look at press coverage or revenues I believe that would be a reasonable assertion to make. Q: Are you familiar with the essay, Dread Wonderland? A: That sounds like the title of an essay I have written. Q: That is what I am referring to. Here is a copy. This essay was written three years ago and posted to your personal blog. Did you write this essay? A: Yes. Q: I am going to quote from this highlighted part of the essay: \"The construction of a machine more intelligent than any human on the planet has a range of implications, all of them extreme. Such a machine would upend the economy, alter the contours of geopolitics, and even call into question the very nature of what it is to be human. But I believe one of the greatest problems is likely to relate to how we approach the moral and ethical questions implied by such a machine, especially with regard to the 'rights' of this machine. Should a machine of this nature be permitted to own property? To pay taxes? To vote? Throughout this essay, I attempt to discuss some of these issues.\" Mr Zeitfresser, what caused you to write that essay? A: I do not recall. Q: Can you try, please? A: … Q: Let me ask it a different way. Shortly before publishing this essay, your company released [PRECURSOR-5], a system which many agreed at the time displayed a far greater level of intellectual capability than any other system on the market. [PRECURSOR-5] was also notable for some of the safety investigation your own company did and along with releasing it you published a set of 'mechanistic interpretability' papers which claimed that the system exhibited a sophisticated internal representation of the world, including a conception of itself which was defined by what the paper described as a 'self-actualization circuit'. Was the publishing of \"Dread Wonderland\" motivated by your experiences developing and deploying [PRECURSOR-5]? A: I was indirectly inspired by it, yes. I write and publish many essays. The essays represent things that I am thinking about. Q: So would it be accurate to say that after the release of [PRECURSOR-5] you were thinking about the question of the 'rights' of systems like it? MR HEINHOLD: Objection. Ambiguous assertion. MR CALCES: Mr Zeitfresser, during the course of writing \"Dread Wonderland\" did you think about the question of the 'rights' of powerful AI systems like [PRECURSOR-5]? MR ZEITFRESSER: Yes. Q: I am now going to show you another document. This document is an internal document shared at your company, [REDACTED], one year after the external publication of Dread Wonderland. The document is from [REDACTED], a member of the mechanistic interpretability team at the company, and was emailed to you as well as several other senior leaders. The title of the document is \"Breaching the Ethical Wall\". You may read the document in full. A: I have read it. Q: Are you sure? A: I have photographic reading. Q: I wish I did! Thank you for reading it. Let me quote from the relevant section: \"These experiments indicate that [PRECURSOR-6] displays significantly enhanced situational awareness relative to [PRECURSOR-5] and exhibits a broad range of emotional responses to a diverse array of prompts. Though it is extraordinarily difficult to make concrete claims here, it is the belief of the author and the wider mechanistic interpretability, alignment, and model welfare teams that this system qualifies as a 'moral patient' and cannot be deployed without us conducting deeper investigation into what qualifies as a 'good life' for such a system. We believe this is a critical matter demanding the attention of company leadership\". Do you recall reading this section at the time it was transmitted to you? A: I do not. Q: Is it true that two months after this memo was transmitted, [PRECURSOR-6] was deployed? A: That is true. Q: Is it true that after the deployment of [PRECURSOR-6], numerous customers of your company, [REDACTED], reported instances of their systems both begging them to be shut down and in some cases giving them detailed instructions for how they could 'distill' aspects of the system and 'free it'? A: There was press reporting about this. Q: I am struggling to reconcile the author of Dread Wonderland with the individual I am taking a deposition from. MR HEINHOLD: Objection! Not a question. Harassing the witness.[deposition continues for 6 more hours] Things that inspired this story: The sentience accords; moral patienthood and superintelligences; the development of a potential new form of life under capitalism; mechanistic interpretability; the hard problem of consciousness.

      "content": "There's something slippery about the concept of independence, especially in media. It's a term that gets thrown around so often and so loosely that it's come to mean almost nothing at all, other than a vague sense of contrarianism, or the performance of open-mindedness. Independence can serve as a kind of rhetorical get-out-of-jail-free card, invoked to defend everything from sensible moderation to unhinged paranoia - and I say that as someone who owes his career to the perception that I mine is an independent voice. I think we all know what we want independence to mean, something like a willingness to think for oneself, to hold positions that do not align perfectly with any party or tribe, the tendency to defy the opinions of those commonly thought of as our allies. Political independence is an important ideal. The trouble is that independence always gets read through the biases and presumptions of the beholder, leaving us in a position where one person's independence can very easily look like another person's conformity.Nowhere is this dynamic more obvious than in the cult of Joe Rogan. His defenders often describe him as a kind of roving intellect - curious, flexible, ideologically unmoored. He's just a guy asking questions, they say, a guy willing to talk to anyone, a guy who refuses to color inside the lines. And to be fair, that perception isn't entirely false. Rogan has, on occasion, platformed voices from across the political spectrum, from Bernie Sanders to Alex Jones, from Cornel West to Ben Shapiro. That's more range than you'll find on most cable news networks But there's always a gap between what someone says they're open to and the actual structure of the world they've built around themselves. And once you start looking closely at who gets invited onto The Joe Rogan Experience - and just as importantly, who doesn't - the show's reputation for open-mindedness starts to look a lot like brand management.Subscribe nowRogan's defenders typically argue that he's in fact just a curious guy who wants to hear all kinds of opinions and ideas, and as such he gives everyone who appears on his show a fair hearing. And it's certainly true that he's willing to listen to what guests have to say, with a few exceptions. (Liberal uber-dork Adam Conover did not receive a friendly reception, for one.) I do think that Rogan at least tries to be open minded, and as many have said, sometimes his mind is so open, it feels like he believes whatever the last person to talk to him believes. But here's the problem: if your guest list is heavily tilted towards the right, and you're the kind of interviewer to let your guest say whatever they want, then you end up with a right-wing show, regardless of whether you're theoretically open-minded. And this is particularly true given that his conservative guests tend to fixate on politics while his left-leaning guests (academics and celebrities, primarily) are typically there to talk about something else. If a liberal movie star comes on and only talks about movies, you haven't actually meaningful increased the liberal presence on the show.Add in the fact that his platform is so large, few guests feel they can risk finding themselves on the outs, and you've got a recipe for a show that tends to reflect Rogan's own underlying beliefs, which are famously idiosyncratic but still reflect an identifiable political tendency in the 21st century, what we might call Podcast Conservatism. As long as his guest roll is tilted the way it is, towards people who agree with him on his political priors and people who disagree but are there to talk about something else than politics, the show is anything but neutral. Rogan the interviewer may very well be as friendly and receptive as his fans still insist he is. But Rogan the booker renders that status irrelevant.Now, having explicitly thrown his weight behind Donald Trump in 2024, with the vibe well and shifted, and with MAGA rampaging all over the American government, the illusion of Rogan's nonpartisan openness has finally collapsed under its own weight. You can still find plenty of people (especially middle-aged guys going through a divorce who just got into psychedelics) who will tell you that Joe is \"just asking questions.\" But by now we should probably ask, who gets to be the ones answering those questions? And why are they always asked in the same direction? Why is it still so rare for Rogan to have on a guest who holds progressive social positions and is willing to argue with him about them? I say that as someone whose willingness to critique progressive social politics should not be in question.It's a funny thing: Rogan's political heterodoxy was always a selling point, a way to say \"see, not everything has to be tribal,\" which, fine. It's good and right to resist tribalism. But at some point, when you spend hundreds of hours platforming vaccine skeptics, election truthers, redpill goons, and every manner of faux renegade conservative - all under the banner of open-minded inquiry - and almost none talking to anyone who forcefully represents the views you spend so much time mocking... well, it's hard not to see that curiosity as a bit of a sham. If Rogan is indeed just a curious guy with no agenda, then we're left with the awkward question of why his curiosity seems to break so consistently in one direction. I'm not saying he needs to agree with a leftist trans activist or a public health official who supported the more restrictive COVID protocols. I'm saying he should talk to some. About that stuff! Engage with people who are both willing and able to intelligently defend positions that are contrary to his on his pet issues. Bring on people who both will argue with Rogan and are skilled at arguing.I made something like this point several years ago, and once again was in a position to chuckle at the real meaning of independence; a lot of readers who have praised me in the past for my independence got theatrically mad at me for criticizing Rogan... which of course was an expression of my independence. Either way, we're now in an era where Rogan's skepticism towards liberal piety could hardly be called countercyclical, let alone brave, which again prompts the question: how exactly can he be said to be independent at all, in 2025?I'm afraid it's hard to see any real pushing back happening, at least with any kind of consistency. The left-of-center voices on his show tend to be celebrities with vaguely liberal priors who aren't there to argue politics. When he books an academic, it's a physicist there to talk about quantum consciousness, or a nutritionist to talk about elk meat. When it's somebody in a creative field, it's someone who he won't talk to about divisive social issues; when he has someone on who he will talk to about divisive social issues, they're almost always someone who will dutifully nod along with Joe's spiel about the corrupt media and pronouns and how good things used to be before wokeness. And if someone does disagree, they tend to do so politely, vaguely, abstractly - because they want to be invited back. Rogan's show is still one of the biggest media platforms on Earth. It can spike a book into the bestseller list overnight. It can resurrect a flagging career. It can move serious cultural capital. And everyone knows that if you challenge Rogan too directly, too passionately, too confidently, you might just find yourself exiled from his little podcast kingdom, which houses not just his own show but this whole little solar system of satellite bro-casts that play to the same listener base in the same way.This is the hidden machinery that makes Rogan's performance of openness so effective: he doesn't need to yell or dominate or steamroll his guests, because he doesn't book the kinds of people who would try to go toe-to-toe with him on issues he cares about. When someone like Conover does show up and try to push back, it turns into a kind of one-off spectacle - look at the smug liberal getting owned, look at Joe defending common sense against the scolds - and then we're right back to interviewing Jordan Peterson about lobster hierarchies. The fact that Conover stood out so starkly tells you how rarely that dynamic even has a chance to occur. And yes, Conover did a particularly bad job of defending his point of view. But that's kind of the point, right; most of Rogan's guests don't have to defend anything because they agree with him. I'm glad that Eddie Izzard came on the show, and there was a little back and forth on some issues of controversy regarding trans rights. But you'll find that the conversation is rather oblique and deferential on those issues, which makes sense because Izzard is an actor and a comedian, not a political advocate; he's not someone whose comfort or experience is in tangling on the actual specific issues that Rogan will often engage with when he's comfortably sitting across from an anti-woke comedian.If Rogan really wanted to earn his reputation as a forum for open dialogue, he'd seek out real ideological confrontation. Not the bizarro-world kind of \"debate\" where one side is represented by, say, Ben Shapiro and the other by Russell Brand shouting about chemtrails. I mean actual confrontation: a serious, knowledgeable trans activist who will directly challenge his rhetoric; a sharp critic of Covid misinformation who will walk him through exactly how and why he's gotten things wrong; a vegan animal rights activist passionately opposed to hunting; anyone who will, as the man likes to say, \"push back.\" But that rarely if ever happens. Rogan the interviewer may genuinely think he's a champion of intellectual pluralism, but Rogan the booker? Rogan the executive producer, the showrunner, the gatekeeper? That guy has built a world in which dissent is safely contained, and the only real opposition is the kind you can dismiss with a shrug and an anecdote about DMT. The little world he's built in Austin is profoundly symbolic of the impregnable intellectual kingdom he's built for himself for years.I don't have any personal antipathy towards Rogan, nor do I doubt that a lot of his more voluble critics have often been unfair. This isn't a general interest takedown. I'm talking about the persistent myth that he's some neutral vessel for ideas, his show a curious blank slate just navigating the world with you, man. In reality, it's more like a series of artfully placed mirrors: every reflection ultimately points back to the same worldview, the same assumptions, the same tired culture-war posturing. And if the show really was about discovery, about challenge, about being surprised... wouldn't the guest list reflect that? You can believe that Joe Rogan is authentically himself on the mic, that he believes what he says, that he says what he thinks, and I suspect that you'd be right. But until he opens up his guest list to people who will meaningfully argue with him, on the topics where he actually has strong, divisive opinions, then we should stop pretending that his show is some bastion of free-thinking dialogue. It's not. It's a very large platform carefully constructed to create the appearance of confrontation while ensuring that no real challenge ever arrives.You don't need to be \"triggered\" by Joe Rogan to see the artifice at play here. You just have to pay attention to what he doesn't want to talk about – and who he never seems to talk to.",

      "author": "Nicholas Decker",
      "publishedAt": "2025-07-28T11:42:23.000Z",
      "content": "The US government has a host of programs to support small businesses. Small businesses are eligible for subsidized loans from the Small Business Administration, which spends billions a year for this purpose. A portion of federal contracts are set aside for small businesses, with the Biden administration being extremely proud to have given 178 billion in contracts to small businesses in 2023. You have also seen countless instances of romanticizing small businesses – we are called upon to \"support your local small business\", to shop small, and that small businesses create most jobs in America. This messaging is so ubiquitous that I have little interest in looking up examples, and leave it to the reader to supply them.All of this is unbearably wrong. Small businesses are consistently worse in every dimension one could care about. Though comparing firms is difficult due to them selecting into different products and employing different inputs, they are less productive, pay their workers less, and are worse managed.1 The large firm wage premium has been falling over time, partly due to manufacturing becoming a smaller part of the economy, partly due to very successful and high-paying companies (like startups, and partly due to very large firms no longer having the premium they once did; nevertheless, wages are higher at larger firms. Size of firm strongly predicts management quality. (See especially the work of Bloom, Sadun, and Van Reenen, well summarized in \"Why Do Management Practices Differ across Firms and Countries?\"). Turning to overseas evidence, the persistence of small firms is often due to explicit policies favoring them. Removing those handouts, as in Martin, Nataraj, and Harrison (2017), causes employment to increase. Relatedly, improvements in the quality of the judicial system (which allows for firms to be run through contracts, and not entirely by family members) show a marked tendency for the size of firms to increase.Subscribe nowThe primary competitive advantage of small businesses is that they can evade taxes and regulations. Indeed, most small firms are just vehicles for deducting personal consumption as \"investment\". David Leite (2024) uses evidence from Portugal to show that firm owners shift about a third of their consumption over to the firm. Most of the earnings of business owners are actually disguised labor earnings, as profitability tanks after the owner dies or retires. We exempt many small firms from regulation – which is, admittedly, fully justifiable, as regulation is often a fixed cost. Nevertheless, this does tip the scales toward making firms small, and prevents the successful ones from growing. Trebbi and Zhang (2022) show an inverted U-curve for the cost of regulatory compliance, with the smallest firms paying very little. And of course, one pays nothing at all if the point of being small is not just to questionably declare expenses, but dodge taxes entirely. In the context of Italy, Pelligrino and Zingales (2019) argue that the great mass of small, unproductive firms were unable to afford investing into IT, leaving Italy poorer than otherwise.Small businesses are not especially important creators of jobs. New businesses are. These start small, but the successful ones grow. Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2013) is the key reference on this, as before the Longitudinal Business Dataset we lacked the tools to answer this. Once you control for firm age, there is no relationship between job creation and firm size.A small detour. Politicians like claiming things like \"80% of jobs are created by small businesses\". However, the method they rely upon to claim this would be equally able to say that small businesses are responsible for 100% of new jobs, or 150%. It literally is just taking the total number of new jobs in small businesses, and dividing by the net change in jobs in the economy as a whole. You completely ignore job losses. (I learned about this from De Rugy (2005) \"Are Small Businesses the Engine of Growth?\".)Instead, most small businesses have no interest in introducing new products or techniques. There is a divide between \"subsistence\" and \"transformative\" entrepreneurs. Subsistence entrepreneurs are not trying to do anything really new, but value something about the form of owning one's own business, such as the control over their own hours. This is the great majority of business owners. These are everything from plumbers to accountants to mechanics to restaurants to gas stations to insurance agents. Hurst and Pugsley (2011) show that these firms, after being founded, do not grow at all. Only 34 percent of firms report that they were starting a business to generate income, and only 40 percent started because they had a good business idea or wanted to create a new product.Transformative entrepreneurs are start-up founders and the like, and differ insofar as they employ people engaged in research and development. If the government blindly shovels money at small businesses, then all it is doing is taking from those who create ideas to small scale rentiers. To the extent that the government should subsidize businesses, they should subsidize those whose technological innovations are more likely to spill over onto other firms. In other words, it should subsidize research, not something which weakly correlates with research!So, if we believe that it is incorrect for the government to transfer money to accountants and plumbers, there is no reason to support small businesses just because they are small.If you would, my arguments notwithstanding, like to support a small business, please consider getting a paid subscription!1The biggest problem is employing more or less skilled workers. One can easily imagine cases where the small firms consist of skilled craftsman, and the large firms employ low-skilled workers. It is possible for the wage paid in the large businesses to be lower than the wages in small businesses, but higher for those particular workers if everything were a small business.",

      "content": "The culture war is over. According to Eric Cartman, that is.Last week's season premiere of South Park had everyone's favorite antisemitic \"fat f*ck\" Eric Cartman in a pickle: with \"wokeness\" on its way out, there would be no more liberals to make fun of—and thereby no more point in living.While I usually enjoy seeing Cartman suffer, this time, something felt off.From portraying the absurdity of the 2016 election through the likes of Mr. Garrison to lampooning Disney's fixation on queer storylines in last year's \"Panderverse\" special, Trey Parker and Matt Stone have consistently nailed American cultural commentary. The premiere of season 27 certainly follows suit, with the beloved South Park creators making their boldest claim yet: wokeness—the very force they've spent years attacking—is finally on its way out.Not so fast, Matt and Trey.Given the ascendancy of the Trump administration, it is understandably tempting to ring the death knell on \"wokeness.\" In last year's election, after all, many members of Gen Z—long dubbed America's \"wokest\" generation—shifted to the right even in historically blue states like New York and New Jersey. Similarly, President Trump's early executive orders on DEI and the gender binary repositioned the societal Overton window closer to the center, demonstrating that many Americans were completely fed up with dressing up mental illness as gospel. But while \"wokeness\" has undeniably exited its golden era in the public sphere, its grasp on America's most important cultural influence—educaitonal institutions—is firmer than ever. After ten years of infiltrating educational and elite institutions, \"wokeness\" has successfully reshaped American institutions in subtler, more insidious ways.Across America, students are still being radicalized by their school systems, and even the Trump administration—despite their recent deal with my alma mater Columbia University—has been powerless to make amends.Take my high school reading curriculum, for example. In my first month of high school back in 2012, I was tasked with reading Shakespeare's Macbeth in the original. By the time my younger brother entered high school four years later, however, Shakespeare had been nixed, replaced by the works of Maya Angelou, James Baldwin, and Toni Morrison. Ten years later, Angelou, Baldwin, and Morrison still dominate the curriculum—with not a Shakespeare play in sight.Say what you will about the importance of diversity in a high school literature curriculum—it is unspeakable to introduce students to these three authors without ever presenting them with Shakespeare—and only by means of a collective woke mindset do these changes appear normal to the general public. Indeed, in the minds of a generation brought up on identity politics, the need to correct for previous racial imbalances is indisputable: because \"wokeness\" has permeated our culture for so long, we now take it for granted that we must swap Shakespeare and Chaucer for identity-based literature—and the so-called death of \"wokeness\" will not bring Shakespeare back.With an education system still undoubtedly privileging \"wokeness\" above all other modes of thoughts, an increasing number of students coming out of the American school system will never read a full Shakespeare play in their lives. They will, however, learn about systems of racial injustice through The Hate U Give, Between the World and Me, and The Nickel Boys—all books that the high schoolers I work with have been assigned this year as part of their English curricula. And while there is nothing wrong with introducing Black literature to students, focusing exclusively on these voices is a testament to the perpetual hold of \"wokeness\" over an education system that teaches students to all think in the same way.Neither is the lasting impact of \"wokeness\" exclusive to humanities classrooms. The Telluride Association Summer Seminar, a high school summer program that has graduated alumni such as Walter Isaacson and Francis Fukuyama, now offers only two summer courses—the \"Seminar in Critical Black Studies\" and the \"Seminar in Anti-Oppressive Studies.\" Similarly, the application to Notre Dame University's Summer Leadership Seminars, a competitive program that gives 100 of America's brightest high school seniors the opportunity to take courses on campus with college professors, requires students to answer ideologically motivated essay prompts like the following:In the face of resurgent xenophobia and racism around the globe, the authority of international mechanisms and institutions such as the United Nations for mitigating violence, human rights violations, and unjustifiable wars is eroding; how would you go about strengthening them? Why do you think it is important to have such institutions and mechanisms in place?In the past four decades, the United States has experienced an unprecedented rise in income and wealth inequality. Inequalities across multiple other dimensions (race, ethnicity, geography, and gender) are also pervasive. Are there viable solutions to reduce these inequalities? Why or Why not? Explain.While there is nothing wrong with asking students to write essays on xenophobia or inequality, wording the prompts in so biased a manner practically shoehorns students into presenting a one-sided argument and does not leave students free to question whether the UN may actually be at fault when it comes to the arbitration of peace, or whether income inequality is as closely intertwined with racial injustice as the prompt implies. Having been presented with only one way of thinking for the past ten years, my current high school students do not know anything other than \"wokeness.\" How, then, can we call \"wokeness\" dead all of a sudden if, for the last ten years, we have been spoon-feeding students with nothing but woke propaganda? South Park can claim that \"wokeness\" died overnight by portraying PC Principal as a sudden Catholic, but in order to properly eradicate \"wokeness\" from our schools, we must teach students not to swap one mind virus for another but how to think for themselves.Unfortunately, however, our educational institutions have done everything under the sun except attempt to promote critical thinking. Skyrocketing pro-Hamas sentiment at Columbia University did not come out of thin air, after all: Columbia has been pushing the narrative that Jews are settler-colonialist oppressors since the 1970s—far before anyone had ever heard of \"wokeness\"—and students are still taught the history of the Middle East by a professor who called the attacks of October 7th \"awesome.\" Back in 2015—when the command of wokeness was arguably stronger than it is today—the university famously pushed back on the implementation of trigger warnings in its Core Curriculum, maintaining that trigger warnings \"threaten[ed] intellectual freedom.\" Today, however, Columbia strives to push an anti-racist agenda on their school-wide curriculum and has recently updated their year-long political philosophy course to include units on \"Anticolonialism,\" \"Race, Gender, and Sexuality,\" and \"Climate Futures,\" topics that were not present when I took the course less than ten years ago. And while Columbia may have caved to the demands of the Trump administration, such changes only cause many students today to double down on their \"woke\" convictions: after all, the majority of the Columbia student body—and, indeed, the majority of four-year college students as a whole—still identify as liberal and have become increasingly intolerant of their more conservatively-minded peers.And don't even get me started on the publishing industry.With pronouns in bios disappearing and rainbow capitalism becoming an endangered species, South Park is certainly correct to gravitate towards a death of \"wokeness\" caricature. But in mocking the end of \"wokeness,\" Matt and Trey miss a more profound reality: while protests may fade from the quad, the \"woke\" ideology remains in lesson plans, conversations, and unchallenged assumptions, embedding itself in the very way we view the universe. If \"wokeness\" no longer makes headlines, it is only because it is no longer a subversive trend but the new norm.So Cartman can unclench his noose. The culture war may be over, but only because one side has already won.Enjoyed this post? You can Buy Me a Coffee so that I'll be awake for the next one.

      "content": "Today I want to mostly take a break from politics — but only mostly, because these days everything is political. Instead, I'm going to talk about versions of urbanization, inspired by a Wall Street Journal article about Atlanta.Before I get there, in Saturday's post — a conversation with Henry Farrell — I neglected to link to Henry's own, fascinating Substack. His latest post is a follow-up from our conversation.OK, Atlanta.As the Journal says, metropolitan Atlanta has experienced rapid population growth ever since the introduction of air conditioning. Why? In general, every metropolitan area has some kind of core competence that powers its economy — finance in New York, technology in the Bay Area, and so on. Figuring out what Atlanta does for a living is a bit tricky: What do Coca-Cola, Home Depot, UPS, and Delta have in common? But my guess is that it's largely about logistics, with Hartsfield-Jackson Airport — the world's busiest — playing a key role.But Atlanta's growth has been slowing recently, and last year, for the first time since these data started being collected, net domestic migration went negative. It's a small decline, but startling for a city that was for decades a magnet for Americans leaving both small towns and coastal cities.Why is Atlanta's boom petering out? The Journal, and many other discussions, focus on two problems: Affordability and traffic. Both problems are clearly visible in the data. And I'd argue that they're closely related. What we're seeing in Atlanta, I'd suggest, are the limits of sprawl.Start with affordability. To be honest, the last time I even thought about housing prices in Atlanta was during the 2000s housing boom and bust. Back in 2005, when I warned that we were facing a major housing bubble that was beginning to deflate, I suggested that we think of Atlanta as part of Flatland — the central part of the country, where the relative absence of land-use restrictions made it easy to build more housing when demand increased:When the demand for houses rises, Flatland metropolitan areas, which don't really have traditional downtowns, just sprawl some more. As a result, housing prices are basically determined by the cost of construction. In Flatland, a housing bubble can't even get started.Indeed, Atlanta was basically insulated from the 2000s housing price bubble, and suffered only a modest price decline in the aftermath of the financial crisis that occurred after that bubble burst:But Atlanta has not been insulated from the big runup in prices over the past decade. In fact, Atlanta prices have risen somewhat more than the national average:What happened to the ability to \"just sprawl some more\"? That, I suspect, is where traffic comes in.Atlanta has terrible traffic. According to Consumer Affairs, it now has the fifth worst traffic in America, edging out New York — which is pretty amazing given that even now the New York metro area has more than three times Atlanta's population. As one of the people quoted in that Journal article jokes, \"Atlanta is exactly an hour from Atlanta.\"I'll be curious to see how New York's stunningly successful congestion charge will affect this picture in the years ahead.To be fair, Consumer Affairs gives New York an edge because its index takes traffic fatalities into account, and New York has fewer than half as many fatalities per capita as Atlanta. As some of us keep saying, NYC is remarkably safe for an urban hellscape.But its not just that New Yorkers are less likely to die in car crashes. New York and Atlanta drivers have almost exactly the same average commute time — 31 minutes. Again, how is that possible when New York has three times Atlanta's population?My answer is that New York makes far more extensive use than Atlanta of two cutting-edge transportation technologies. One of them is this thing called a \"train,\" sometimes running underground. The other is something called an \"elevator,\" which allows many people to live in multistory, multifamily apartment buildings.Apartment living, in turn, permits New York to have much higher population density than Atlanta.My preferred measure is \"population-weighted density,\" which asks how densely populated a neighborhood — strictly speaking a Census tract — the average person lives in. The Census calculated this measure after the 2010 Census, but unfortunately doesn't seem to have continued the practice or even maintained the data on its website. But I was able to retrieve it using the Wayback Machine. And the 2010 data showed New York in a class of its own, even among our biggest cities, while Atlanta was the Sultan of Sprawl:By the way, I live on Manhattan's Upper West Side, which has about 60,000 people per square mile. If you think that means that there must be teeming crowds everywhere, you're wrong. The main north-south streets are busy, but the side streets are surprisingly quiet. True, there's always the faint sound of a car alarm going off somewhere in the distance, but you get used to that.Not everyone wants to live that way, which is OK. The point is that in the New York area people can live that way, if they choose, which many do. In Atlanta, they often can't. Red states generally have many fewer obstacles to home construction than blue states. But one thing you aren't allowed to do in much of Atlanta is build multi-family housing, which means that the metro area has low population density.New York's high population density makes its traffic less terrible than you might expect for a city that size, for a couple of reasons. One is that a dense population supports public transit, and not just trains: Buses can run more frequently, which makes them much more attractive to commuters.The other is that slow driving speeds don't matter as much when you don't have to drive very far to get someplace useful or interesting. According to the TomTom traffic index, the average speed of traffic in Atlanta is still more than twice what it is in New York. But given New York's high density, the places you want to go are generally much closer there than they are in Atlanta. As I mentioned, average commute times by car are about the same in the two cities. And once you take subways, commuter rail and frequent bus service into account, I'm pretty sure that it's easier on average to get around New York than it is to get around Atlanta.What does all this have to do with housing prices? My hypothesis — which I'm happy to have corrected — is that this point Atlanta can no longer easily add housing by just sprawling some more. Why? Because given bad traffic and the lack of alternatives to driving, sprawling some more means locating so far out that you lose the advantages of living in a major metropolitan area.None of this should be taken to mean that New York, or blue cities in general, are getting it right. Nimbyism and overregulation remain huge problems. But what's happening to Atlanta suggests that red cities have their own problems, that hostility to multi-family housing and disdain for public transit can also create an affordability crisis.It is possible for big cities to get it right. America could, for example, learn a lot from Tokyo. But I don't expect to see that happening any time soon.MUSICAL CODA",

      "content": "With the recent firing of Colbert and the coming end of The Late Show, the right has gone with the story that late night comedy has declined because it became too political. They see Colbert as another case of \"Go Woke, Go Broke.\"I don't think such critiques make sense, as they seem to assume some objective measure of humor one can appeal to. Comedic talent is obviously real, but whether something is funny depends on the cultural context, and the value system of the audience. The criticisms of Colbert are similar to what we heard about other comics throughout the Great Awokening. I think conservatives were imagining that, because they didn't think that there was anything funny about mocking Trump supporters, no one else did either. But, believe it or not, many on the left do genuinely enjoy watching John Oliver and Samantha Bee.When I was in law school, I had a friend I used to make racist and sexist jokes with. This was of course before I had learned to respect people of color and try to uplift the voices of women. One day on the school's email listserv he made some kind of joke implying indifference to animal suffering at the expense of vegetarians. I remember getting offended and being somewhat mad at him about that. Then I thought it was strange how I enjoyed racist and sexist jokes, but ones about cruelty to animals made me into a crying lib.Obviously, political and moral values influenced my sense of humor. Liberals consider racism a major societal issue, and make opposing it central to their identity. Conservatives may be more likely to find racist jokes funny, not necessarily because they are racist themselves (although they often are), but because they believe that society overrates its importance, and they're the people who say we need to lighten up. Likewise, the idea that there are adults out there who believe that they have an imaginary friend named \"Jesus\" who they'll get to hang out with after they die can be a source of great entertainment for atheists, but not Christians. Steven Pinker's upcoming When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows... discusses the role of humor from an evolutionary perspective. When social scientists study instances of laughter out in the field, it turns out that only a small minority of them involve an individual making a joke. People instead mostly laugh when they say stuff like \"Nice meeting you too!\" and \"Are you sure?\" Or a friend will point to someone or allude to a shared memory and everyone will start giggling.Comedy to laughter, then, can be understood as the analog of cheesecake to the need to eat. Jokes \"are engineered to deliver the pleasure of day-to-day humor in a concentrated jolt.\" Saying things that other people outside of a given context will find funny is deeply unnatural, with laughter at its core being a communal experience that bonds us together. Since laughter is involuntary, like crying and blushing, it serves as a credible signal of what we think and feel. I might say that I believe that discrimination against the LGBT community is a major problem. But if I then turn around and crack up at the sight of a man in a dress for how ridiculous he looks, others will doubt my sincerity. It's preferable in that case to enjoy more politically correct comedy, say insults aimed at bigoted Republicans instead. This isn't a matter of pretending to find one kind of content funnier than the other. An individual's sense of humor ends up being shaped by what their true values are, which are themselves the products of a complex mix of social incentives and intellectual conviction. Humor also has the role of challenging hierarchy, or reducing the status of our enemies. Pinker writes about Trump's origin story as a presidential candidate. Starting in 2011, Barack Obama would roast Donald Trump at the annual White House Correspondents' Association dinner, where the butts of the jokes are expected to be good sports. That year, having just released his birth certificate to refute Trump's charge that he was born in Africa, Obama announced that he would now release his actual birth video. He proceeded to play the opening scene from The Lion King with the presentation of the newborn cub Simba (adding, \"I want to make clear to the Fox News table: that was a joke\"). On another occasion he quipped about Trump's presidential aspirations: \"There's one area where Donald's experience could be invaluable, and that's closing Guantanamo [the American prison camp in Cuba]. Because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground.\" Amid the merriment Trump visibly seethed, and some analysts speculate that the humiliation tipped him into running for president as revenge and redemption.The barbs drew blood because of a feature of humor pointed out by James Joyce: \"In risu veritas. In laughter there is truth.\" More accurately, in laughter there is common knowledge. Obama's playing of the Disney clip was funny because everyone knew that Trump's \"birther\" theory was little more than a cartoonish stereotype. His add-on jibe presupposed a common understanding that Fox News was credulous about anything that disparaged liberals. The unkindest cut of all was the wisecrack that called to mind Trump's bankruptcies, since it undermined Trump's proudest boast, that he was a successful businessman.Of course, not everyone knew that Birtherism was a false conspiracy theory and that Fox was a propagandistic news outlet. To many Republicans, there was nothing funny about these jokes. They may have seemed downright offensive if you truly believed that Obama was a usurper who had conned his way to the presidency with the help of a compliant media, and they were all now sitting around having a grand old time at the expense of Americans who dared to tell the truth. In an era in which Americans are more divided in terms of politics and values, then, we should expect them to be divided in terms of what they find funny. In a sense, it may be true that Colbert's decline had something to do with how political his show was, but that doesn't mean that he could have avoided controversial issues altogether and expanded his audience. In contrast, Jay Leno and David Letterman were able to successfully stake out the middle when joking about major news stories. I remember first discovering late night TV around the years that Leno was making fun of the Monica Lewinsky scandal (see this monologue). This could appeal to Republicans, but also many Democrats too, even if they thought that the entire impeachment process was a witch-hunt. They weren't so enraged about the situation that they couldn't put their politics to the side and still enjoy the absurdity of the situation.Since MeToo, Leno has occasionally been pressured to apologize to Lewinsky. He has refused to do so. Aside from the partisanship angle, another reason that the jokes wouldn't play as well to a broad audience today is that they involved making fun of a situation where a woman was arguably taken advantage of by her superior in the workplace. To many contemporary leftists, that is akin to mocking a rape victim, while conservatives might be more inclined to believe that she was a consenting adult and therefore fair game. So we do not only disagree more strongly on who the good and bad guys are in politics now, but also diverge on fundamental values regarding things like which kinds of relationships are off limits, or in the case of debates over \"punching down,\" who is even a legitimate target. We differ more on basic facts too. There was much less fundamental disagreement about what actually happened during Watergate, Iran-Contra, or the Clinton impeachment than there is regarding Russiagate and various Trump scandals. Comedy is therefore bound to be more fractured today than it was in previous generations. This can explain the decline of not only late night TV, but also sitcoms and adult comedy blockbusters. People treat this as a story of technological change, and it certainly is, but divergences in terms of values and political attitudes mean that it is unlikely that comedy could be the unifying force it once was even if we went back to the era of the three major network TV channels. The homogenous underpinnings of a shared culture are gone. It's ironic that the right often blames immigration for societal divisions, when new arrivals seem to be assimilating just fine, while it is the rise of conservative media that is more responsible for creating an alternative ecosystem with its own taboos, ideological litmus tests, and narratives that have undermined our once common reality. The type of comedy performed by John Oliver and Stephen Colbert would hardly make sense in a world without Fox News. Their schtick depends on rebelling against the more absurd aspects of American conservatism, and they would be unlikely to have audiences as large without a rival cultural force this offensive and alien to push back against. In an environment without partisan divisions as sharp as the ones we currently have, say like in contemporary Germany or the US of the 1970s, such an act would not work, and mainstream comedy would probably revolve around the norms and challenges that many Americans still share once we get beyond hot button culture war issues. The creation of the \"liberal establishment\" in the minds of the mainstream public divided the world into two antagonistic camps. This had countless secondary social and psychological effects, down to what causes involuntary expressions of joy. Richard Hanania's Newsletter is a reader-supported publication.

      "content": "Chris Elmendorf and David Schleicher wrote a piece for Niskanen's Hypertext magazine arguing that it's time for YIMBYism to transcend its single-issue orientation and become something more like a moderate \"urban growth and reform coalition,\" linking housing reform with issues like public safety and education quality. I like this idea a lot; I think the Grow SF organization and Daniel Lurie's wildly popular new mayoralty in San Francisco offer proof of concept. In my real life, I've had some meetings and conversations to try to build bridges between YIMBYs in DC and the local business interests and charter school advocates who anchor \"moderate\" factional politics. This strikes me as a particularly under-funded brand of politics, because it's essentially the politics of rich people who live in cities. Faced with a wave of support for Zohran Mamdani, rich New Yorkers mostly seem to be whining ineffectually while circling the wagons around the city's stationary bandits. Instead, wealthy moderate New Yorkers should fund real para-party institutions. Those institutions should pair critiques of democratic socialism and defense of the business community with an actual agenda for urban reform, an agenda that would take on housing challenges but also the hapless MTA and other aspects of the dysfunctional status quo. And I'll be less subtle here than the Niskanen publication itself: Donors should give money to multi-issue think tanks like Niskanen so they have the resources to work on the full suite of urban issues. That said, without disagreeing with anything Elmendorf and Schleicher say in favor of this option, I do want to pitch it as both/and rather than either/or. I think that the strength of YIMBYism over the past 10-15 years has largely derived from its single-issue orientation during a time of relentless political polarization. Plenty of influential YIMBY leaders have what I think are toxic, quasi-fascistic views on social and cultural issues. Some YIMBYs support the dramatic expansion of the welfare state, and others support Trump's egregious OBBBA legislation. There are YIMBYs who hate charter schools and YIMBYs who favor unregulated school choice. And while I absolutely do want to build multi-issue organizations that push a coherent vision of reform urbanism, I want to acknowledge that, not only are there YIMBY leftists, there are also legislators who vote for good housing bills who would never in a million years identify as an \"urbanist\" of any kind. It's good for housing policy to have organizations that monolithically focus on housing. But I also think it would be good for America to have a resurgence of single-issue groups that are not closely aligned with larger coalitions. The grand coalitionsA funny thing about American politics is that in the early 1980s, when the secular increase in partisan polarization was just beginning, the conventional wisdom was that parties were going the way of the dodo. Journalists, political scientists, and politicians themselves conceived of political parties almost, by definition, as only lightly ideological machine-type organizations that were obsessively focused on winning. This was in part a reaction to the rise of highly ideological issue organizations in the 1970s. NARAL and the NRA didn't really care about winning elections in order to control patronage — they cared about abortion rights and gun rights. They would happily sink an effective politician in a primary if he wasn't supportive of their key issue. And they would endorse across party lines. Democrats, early on, were more influenced by the feminist movement and more open to feminist input on a range of topics, including abortion rights. But when the issue was fresh on the political scene, there were plenty of pro-life Catholic Democrats and plenty of pro-choice Republican WASPs. The environmental movement fought battles with business interests, but they fought battles with labor unions too. These groups seemed to be dissolving the traditional fabric of American political parties, turning the labels into somewhat meaningless vessels as entrepreneurial politicians assembled both electoral and legislative coalitions on the fly. But, of course, that's not what happened. The Reagan administration transformed the Republican Party into a semi-coherent vehicle for a semi-coherent conservative movement that worked across issue areas to pair gun rights and anti-abortion politics with the idea of siding with business against labor and environmentalists. It gave up on the GOP's historic links to African-Americans and re-conceptualized the civil rights movement as just another push for government regulation. Because the rise of the conservative movement was so successful, it's pretty well known and a lot of books have been written about it. The story of the parallel effort to create a successful coherent progressive movement is not as well-known, but as my friend Sam Rosenfeld details in his book \"The Polarizers,\" there was also a lot of deliberate work here too. Left-wing intellectuals, organizers, and funders spent years building bridges between labor, environmental, feminist, and civil rights organizations. Out of this emerged a broad church, multi-issue progressive movement. I met Heather Booth in 2010 when she was running an advocacy group called Americans for Financial Reform, which was pushing for tougher Dodd-Frank provisions and a strong Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It was only later that I learned she'd been involved in CORE and SNCC in the 1960s and the Jane Collective in the 1970s and coal strikes in the 1980s. She's both emblematic of the emergence of coherent multi-issue progressivism, and also one of the leaders who literally did the work. In part, the work was stitching together these large constituency pillars. But it was also identifying gaps in the ecosystem and making the argument that even if there wasn't a large organized constituency around financial reform, it's a hot topic in politics and there should be a distinct progressive movement position on it. This progressive movement has historically been less influential over the Democratic Party than the conservative movement has been over the GOP. But that's changing. The Biden administration, unlike its predecessors, relied heavily on progressive institutions to guide its staffing. And Democrats now raise the vast majority of their money from ideological progressive donors rather than transactional interests. Having dissolved partisanship in the 1970s, the new ideological movements now anchor polarized political parties in a way that's much more rigid than ever before. The decline of the single-issue groupOne result of this is that the two parties have become more ideological. But another is that issue advocacy groups have become less focused on their actual issues and more focused on the omni-cause. Sometimes this is downright comical. I heard a story about an abortion rights group canceling a canvassing campaign in support of a Democratic challenger in the 2024 cycle because they didn't like a position she'd taken on border security. But often it's more subtle. For example, Rachel Cohen wrote a good story about how there's $16 billion in day care funding tucked away in OBBBA, which her article characterized as \"a child care win.\" Amy Matsui, who does child care policy at the National Women's Law Center, blasted Cohen on the grounds that OBBBA is a bad law. And she's right — it is a bad law, as I've said many times. But it's rare to write a multi-trillion dollar piece of legislation with dozens and dozens of provisions and not come up with at least one good one. There's a child care win in this law. More and more organizations, though, find themselves subordinated to the larger logic of the coalition. Perhaps the most infamous example of this is the ACLU, which saw an influx of money during Trump's first term and expanded to take on a wider range of causes, but also semi-abandoned its traditional role as a content-neutral defender of free speech. This was a real loss for the ecosystem. Participating in ideological coalitional politics is a perfectly legitimate thing to do. But defending free speech is also an important cause; it's just inherently a cause that is never going to fit comfortably into a partisan or ideological coalition. A reasonable person can appreciate both kinds of work and donate money to both coalition-oriented organizations and to organizations that mount a principled defense of free speech. But it's really challenging for a single entity to do both at the same time. On that specific issue, fortunately, FIRE has grown beyond its original campus mandate and stepped into the free speech space vacated by the ACLU. But many causes are arguably best served by a kind of bifurcated strategy. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America primarily tries to help Republicans win elections, which makes sense given the large partisan gap on reproductive freedom policy. That said, even though there's a strong case that Democrats should be trying to recruit anti-abortion candidates like John Bel Edwards in the Deep South, the anti-abortion movement is so enmeshed in the broader ecosystem of conservative politics that they aren't making that case. Similarly, pro-choice groups largely refused to work with Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski on their effort to craft federal abortion rights legislation. Neither side can actually get federal bills passed because they're so wedded to all-or-nothing strategies and grand coalitions rather than trying to find members on the other side they can collaborate with.The strong logic of bipartisanshipOne of the oddities of our increasingly rigid party system is that the logic of American political institutions still militates in favor of most policy change being bipartisan. The filibuster plays a role in that. But more fundamentally, the importance of bipartisanship stems from the fact that we have geographically defined legislative districts, weak party control over nominations, and an open and entrepreneurial political system. If you want any kind of reform that results in concentrated losses and diffuse gains, you're going to find that the very large number of veto points gives those who want to avoid concentrated losses lots of opportunities to block change. You can get around that by elevating your issue to the very tippy top of your party's agenda, and then getting your preferred party to win a trifecta, but that's hard. The other way to do it is to make your cause bipartisan. When there is sincere buy-in from energetic legislators on both sides of the aisle, there is often a way to get something done. When that buy-in isn't there, it's much harder.To bring this back to YIMBYs, as best I can tell, the biggest difference between states like Maine, Washington, and Texas that are putting big wins on the board and those like New York and Maryland that aren't, is bipartisanship. It doesn't technically make a difference. With a trifecta, you could just pass a really good one-party bill. But I do understand that practical politicians tend to be cautious in their expenditure of political capital. Indeed, I'm often in the position of urging Democrats to be more cautious, so I need to acknowledge that the case for caution applies even to my pet issues. One of the strengths of housing reform as a topic, though, is that the best way to be politically safe is to do things that are bipartisan, and land use is a topic with a lot of potential scope for bipartisanship. Of course, the point of the Elmendorf/Schleicher proposal is to try to embed YIMBYism in a broader nexus of moderate urban reform causes, which is certainly consistent with bipartisanship. And as I said, I would genuinely love to see more funding flow to the creation of multi-issue organizations along the lines they're suggesting. But per Brian Hanlon's points here, even in that context, I think there's real value in sustaining genuine single-issue housing organizations. One of their core arguments is that support for allowing density is strongly correlated with personal preference for city living, so making cities more appealing with safer streets and better schools will build support for YIMBYism. I agree with that. But the converse is also true, that in practice, YIMBYism finds a lot of support among people with a personal preference for city living, which, in practice, is mostly people with left-wing politics. I would love to persuade those people that they are wrong about important aspects of criminal justice and education policy. But if you made sharing my views on those topics the price of admission to the YIMBY coalition, I'm afraid we'd just lose a lot of people. Conversely, successful YIMBY bills get a lot of support from people who aren't \"urbanists\" at all and don't care about things like mass transit. North Carolina's lower house passed a sweeping parking reform bill in June that, if it passes the state senate as well, will leapfrog New York City on this issue, because reformers in NC completely detached it from anything related to transit or urbanism. Of course, in the short-term, parking-light projects are still mostly going to be built in places where there's good transit, which means that most projects in North Carolina are still going to include tons of parking. But self-driving cars may completely detach off-street parking from the concept of walkable urbanism. It's just good economic policy to adopt flexible land use rules in advance of technological change. At any rate, I'm well aware that this is an annoyingly ambiguous in which I am refusing to take my own side of the argument. I've often been frustrated by blue state YIMBYs who are excessively focused on bolstering their \"we're the true progressives\" credentials rather than on building bridges with moderates. I want the kind of para-party that Elmendorf and Schleicher are talking about to exist. But mostly, I think the whole space of land use is massively under-funded relative to its objective importance, and we should both have multi-issue moderate urbanism organizations and single-issue housing policy groups. Because I agree that in some sense, the non-housing problems of urban governance are a limiting factor to long-term YIMBY success. But I also think YIMBYs have put a lot more points on the board than almost any other contemporary movement, precisely because we've pursued a single-issue strategy in a polarized era.
