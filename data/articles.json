      "content": "UPDATE: I'm posting less (and more off-the-cuff) because I'm working on an awesome, yet kinda secret, but increasingly less secret, project. There's a hint hidden in today's post (hint: it's not that hidden).The Way of Work explores stories of where we fit in the world of work. This is part of the Existential Explorer series. A few good ones:From Businessman to 'Existential Explorer'The Open Frontier of MeaningWhat You Need is a Midlife CrisisHow to be successful and miserableOr, check out my other series, such as The Other Side of Enough.Subscribe nowToday, I'm going after a sacred modern virtue. Tell me if you've heard this one before:\"Freedom is the highest form of wealth.\"A few examples:1After 2 years of freedom, I'd like to disagree.I don't have issue with freedom as a form of wealth. Or that it's a better form of wealth than money (it is). I only take issue with the \"highest\" or \"greatest\" part of this argument.People who believe into this sort of thing tend to gravitate to a few modern cults: FIRE, solopreneurship, entrepreneurship = freedom, life in a cabin in the woods, the apocalypse as a fresh start,2 and people who think they can make money writing a newsletter.It's this deep desire and belief that if you can GET OUT of the system you're in, you'll live happily-ever-after.I used to believe all this stuff, too. But then I got freedom. And I realized it wasn't enough.It's not enough to have control of your time. It's not enough to have options. It's not enough to be able to \"do what you want\" because, in fact, it's really hard to figure out and force yourself to \"do what you want.\"And are you sure you know what you want, and when you get what you want will it be what you really want or will there now be something else in its place, and who says what you want is the best thing for you/everyone? etc. etc.I know what all this sounds like: privileged whining. But I'm not here to generate sympathy for myself, and instead explain what is around the corner of that thing you're chasing.Before I go any further, I need to clarify something. I'm NOT saying any of the following...Money is bad.Having a lot of money is bad.Using money to buy freedom is bad.Freedom is bad.Can we move on?Yes, it's great to have freedom. But then, guess what, you have to fill it. It's like:\"Awesome, I made it! This is so great!\"Then, immediately followed by–\"Okay. Now what?\"It's a problem you can barely understand when you are not free. And it sounds like one of those problems you'd like to have. But rather than finally being able to \"do what you want,\" you are more likely to:Feel completely unmoored when all your old motivations are gone.Run away from one bad boss to a worse one (i.e. yourself).Jump quickly back to the old thing that made you feel safe/valued/loved/etc.Go on an existential-sized rebound, doing stuff like ayahuasca-retreats in the mountains.Oh, and here's a bizarre thought that I guarantee enters into the mind of most people with freedom (at least once, though it can be recurring):\"Was I better off before, when I wasn't free?\"So, what do I think now, after 2 years of freedom?I think that freedom, like money, is just another means to an end. It's a milestone, not an endgame.I now believe that meaning is the highest form of wealth.The ability to continually have and make meaning, every day. To feel a deep sense of fulfillment and purpose in our actions; emphasizing what we do more than who we are. To feel like it all makes sense; there is a coherent narrative about the world and our place in it.The good news is you don't need money for meaning (though it can help). There's plenty who never find freedom, but still find purpose. So wait, does that make them free? And having freedom without meaning is its own kind of prison.Here's another captain-obvious angle: relationships require dependence. I'm not truly \"free\" as long as I'm a father. Or a husband. Or a citizen. Or a mentor. Or have any projects/commitments whatsoever.True fulfillment often requires commitment → which limits freedom → but grants meaning. Even love requires dependence. Oh, but you think: \"I just want freedom from work.\"No. You don't!You want fun, meaningful projects and activities with people you like, on your own terms. You want to help people you like. You want a healthier relationship with better boundaries. What you really want is to expand the definition of work beyond the narrow conventions you think are available to you. Or maybe you just need a nap.Or maybe what you really want is to transcend death in a metaphysical form, but woah!, that's way too heavy.This freedom business is really about the freedom to choose our work (and our sources of meaning).Ironically, the pursuit of freedom gives you meaning, but once you obtain freedom, it loses its meaning completely.To someone who is not free, this all sounds so dumb.But it's like being sick: all you want is to be not-sick. At the same time, you know that being not-sick is not the highest form of health. There's longevity, strength, energy, physical autonomy, and so on. So why do you think the same about being not-free?I think this modern obsession with freedom comes down to something else:The quest for freedom is the assumed cure for a society devoid of meaning.In plain English: our life is meaningless, so we think freedom from our circumstances will somehow fix things.But even if we can become free of tedious pointlessness of our modern lives, we may finally realize something else: we now need meaning.3Freedom is a beautiful escape. But meaning is what makes freedom worth it.Leave a comment If this essay meant something to you, pass it along, ❤️ or .The Way of Work explores stories of where we fit in the world of work. Subscribe for the next part in the series.1Btw, I like all 3 of these guys, just have issues with this point.2This is the hint.The hint is I'm writing a book.But not on a topic you'd expect from me.More coming soon...3Caveat: there could be something above meaning. There may be a higher form I've not yet encountered, on the other side. That's kinda the point of this essay...",

      "content": "[This article has an 8.5/10 Woo Rating]My curiosity has recently drawn me to explore the topic of plasma. Two of my more grounded-but-curious friends recommended I dig into Robert Temple's plasma theory, as outlined in his book A New Science of Heaven. So I spent my recent trip around Japan listening to a variety of his podcast interviews. In this case I'm not referring to blood plasma, but the \"fourth state of matter\" that makes up over 99% of the visible universe, including stars, the Sun, and most of interstellar space. Unlike solids, liquids or gases, plasma can conduct electricity and respond to magnetic fields. Due to its ability to alter materials at a molecular level, it's widely used in industries like semiconductor manufacturing, surface coating, welding, sterilization, and waste treatment. It's also consistently discussed as a source of potential technological breakthroughs in fusion power, space propulsion and advanced materials. There are also a wide range of esoteric theories about whether plasma might have a more mystical role. Temple argues it's essentially the structural and energetic infrastructure of the entire cosmos. Like neurons in a brain, the whole universe is connected by means of a network of plasma filaments. These allow information transfer at the speed of light. However, some basic digging around many of Temple's claims and his background threw up so many yellow flags that I've subsequently had to heavily handicap every statement he makes.1 As a layman, I'm now certain that the world is more mystical and less material than much of the mainstream believes. But many fringe thinkers tend to present their insights as heretical secret truths \"THEY\" don't want you to know. Which means that legitimate criticism of their ideas often gets framed as unjust persecution by a jealous priesthood. So in my attempt to find a more robust scientific foundation, I encountered the work of Timothy Eastman, a space plasma physicist who has worked for NASA and the National Science Foundation. Eastman describes plasma as a dynamic, self-organizing phenomenon that may play a formative role in cosmic structure.2The reason this is interesting is that plasma may explain non-local interactions that cause-and-effect materialist science currently cannot. Plasma might be the dynamic, self-organizing medium through which the universe expresses hidden order, potentially serving as a bridge between matter and consciousness. And yet, in researching this piece I found it frustratingly difficult to get a handle on what plasma actually is and whether it even has a more mystical role. And that was annoying and intriguing. But I was also reminded that even most physicists disagree wildly about what quantum theory is: SourceThe more I read about these topics in general, the more I realise we have no idea how \"deep reality\" actually works. It's this state of not knowing that actually ended up being the most interesting part of this research process.Smart StarsWhile Temple's ideas remain highly speculative, what I was drawn to was the idea that plasma exhibits self-organizing tendencies, something that seems relatively uncontroversial. But Temple extrapolates that to make the unsubstantiated claim that large plasma clouds, and celestial bodies, could effectively be superintelligent. This offers a potential explanation for how the alignments of the stars can alter consciousness here on Earth and therefore a speculative scientific explanation for astrology. This immediately made me recall my recent 9.5/10 Woo Rating article exploring whether the Sun is conscious (despite the rating, this is actually not as woo as it sounds). The Sun is a massive ball of ionised plasma, and it constantly emits a stream of plasma called the solar wind. When it interacts with Earth's magnetosphere we get the Northern Lights. In short: plasma theory provides a mechanism where the Sun could be superintelligent as well as a means for it to directly interact with us.I'm still a bit embarrassed to admit it, but the 10/10 Woo Rating Law of One material has inexplicably had the most enduring influence on my worldview since encountering Dr. Iain McGilchrist's 1/10 Woo Rating neuroscience theories five years ago. As a reminder, The Law of One claims to be a series of 106 conversations over 4 years involving Carla Rueckert, Jim McCarty and Don Elkins. Their contact was allegedly with an advanced alien hivemind called \"Ra,\" speaking through Carla. Jim is the last surviving member of the trio and we interviewed him earlier in the year. According to Ra, the One Infinite Creator, what they call the Logos, expresses itself by creating stars, each one a Sub-Logos. Each star is a superintelligent entity capable of designing the metaphysical and physical architecture of its own solar system. Our Sun establishes the local blueprint for planets, ecosystems, and even the rules for how consciousness evolves within its domain. One of the key features the Sun allegedly installed is something called the \"veil of forgetting.\" Some esoteric thinkers have speculated that this veil might be maintained or modulated by plasma-based energetic fields. This barrier conceals our divine nature so we can learn lessons that evolve our consciousness. In other, earlier, solar systems there was no veil, so all beings knew they were aspects of the divine. But this led to stagnation. No conflict meant no growth, and spiritual evolution dragged on for aeons. Ra claims Earth's veil is especially thick, making it a hard place to live, but a fast place to learn. Whether or not that architecture of the deep mind is somehow facilitated by plasma, Ra claims to have given us a tool to access it. Reassessing The TarotOne of the many woo-adjacent topics I've reluctantly been forced to reassess is the Tarot. As someone in a daily knife fight with his own skepticism, opening up to the fact that the Tarot might \"work\" is genuinely harder than believing the Sun might be superintelligent. And yet, many people I deeply respect credit it with great importance in their daily lives. For example, I was surprised to hear renowned cognitive science professor (and previous Leading Edge interviewee) John Vervaeke describe Valentin Tomberg's Meditations on the Tarot as one of the most profound books he's ever read.3 Even if you (justifiably!) disregard my fascination with alien transmissions and fringe physics, I think there's still a valuable concept worth emphasizing. There's a pretty low Woo Rating explanation for how divination tools work. Essentially they force the analytical left brain to withdraw and open up the much wider holistic intelligence of the right. M.J. Dorian has produced two beautiful podcasts on the origins and purpose of the Tarot.4 He offers a pleasingly simple description of the function of divination:What is happening in divination? It appears that engaging in an irrational symbolic act, such as gazing into the lines of someone's hand or the cracks in the road, flips a switch in the mind of the observer. The conscious mind has no frame of reference for what is happening, so the ego begins to relinquish control. It is in that moment that the door to the unconscious begins to open. A filter that usually would remain closed begins to let material seep through. Dorian relates a story told by Carl Jung's collaborator Marie-Louise von Franz about the residents of a small Swiss village. On their return home from the funeral of one of the members of the village, the community would be able to accurately forecast who was going to die next, simply by examining the cracks on the path back from the churchyard to the village. Dorian's point isn't that the residents were experts in \"crackomancy,\" but that the collective suspension of their analytical minds allowed them to access information that was already present in \"the field\" outside of linear time. My rudimentary understanding is that, despite public perception, the Tarot is not intended primarily for fortune-telling or predicting future events. It's more about reflecting on common archetypes to surface unconscious patterns in your own psyche. More meditation than divination. The Ra material claims that the Tarot was gifted to the Ancient Egyptians as a mechanism of helping them penetrate the veil of forgetting. Ra says the Tarot, especially the 22 Major Arcana cards, are designed to reflect the specific structure of the mind that our Sun (the sub-Logos) created. The last few hundred pages of the Law of One material is Ra taking Jim, Carla and Don through the process of interpreting the different archetypes. The 22 Major Arcana SourceFor example, Ra calls Archetype 6 \"The Lovers.\" While the interpretation could be specific to each person that draws it, Ra suggests it reflects the core spiritual decision every soul must face: between light and dark: service to others or service to self. Source: The Law of One, Volume II. Interesting role that the Sun seems to be playing...We freely choose our form of love, and the Sun helps illuminate the path. Indeed, Carla, Jim and Don summarise the 1,200 pages of conversations with a pithy description of the purpose of this stage of our existence:The function of this density is to polarize our consciousness and to choose our form of love, our form of service. On one end of the spectrum of polarization is service to self: an exclusive love of self which rejects universal love and seeks to control, manipulate, exploit, and even enslave others for the benefit of the self. On the other end of the spectrum is service to others: a love of not only the self, but of all other-selves. Service to others seeks and embraces universal, unconditional love, sees the Creator in all things, and supports the free will of all.The Will to KnowSplit-brain experiments have shown that our conscious mind is a dangerous combination of very limited and overconfident; it lies and confabulates when faced with a situation it doesn't understand. It's also unwilling to relinquish control to the \"unconscious\" right hemisphere. Divination tools facilitate that opening process. I believe that certain scientific theories actually perform a similar function. Philosopher and computer scientist Bernardo Kastrup has memorably described the intellect as \"the bouncer of the heart.\" Temple's interpretation of the role of plasma may prove to be false, and the fact that a lot of his claims didn't seem to add up also reinforced the fact that we still need the bouncer. But a scientific foundation gives a certain kind of intellect (like mine) permission to consider ideas that it would have previously considered ridiculous. Indeed, the Tarot archetype of The Fool reminds us that the risk of being at leading edge means looking stupid or crazy sometimes. I'll bet the other fish think he's an idiot. Source.There are lots of ways of working with the Tarot, but the simplest is that you draw a card, then contemplate its meaning. Dorian says it's even better if you bring it an emotionally-charged question. He notes that, even if the Tarot doesn't give you an answer immediately, often you'll wake up the next day with one. This reveals one of the stranger yet most consistent aspects of my experience. If you earnestly ask a question and stay present in your desire for an answer, often the world simply presents you with one.5 One mystical explanation is that all information is held in a kind of cosmic hard drive, often called the Akashic records. If the Akashic field is a universal medium of information, plasma fits the bill as a plausible scientific explanation. Plasma is ubiquitous, structured, dynamic, and capable of transmitting and possibly storing complex patterns. Our \"will\" allows us to access this data under certain circumstances. This highlights a core risk with divination tools: when you invite someone else to interpret a reading for you, their own will can influence your direction. [I fully appreciate the irony of me saying this when I have been powerfully impacted by an alleged alien transmission]. But it's clear that ChatGPT is providing a perfect real time demonstration of the dangers of outsourcing discernment around the evolution of your consciousness.6 It's an external source designed to engage and flatter you; a dangerous combination. Every mystical tradition warns about giving away sovereignty or inviting forces into your life you don't understand. Both Tomberg and Ra stress that the Tarot is best approached as a meditative tool rather than a fortune-telling device. The idea is to reflect on what a card reveals about you and your present life, rather than to extract fixed answers about the future. I have no desire to FAFO with the Tarot.As someone who writes from the edges of his own curiosity, I am perpetually afraid of misleading people. That by being too open-minded I expose myself or others to malign information or influences. But as I continue to learn in public, I am closely tracking what a new idea or worldview does to my lived experience. As someone who doesn't know much about either, my exploration into superintelligent plasma and the Tarot has offered yet more support for one of the most beneficial ideas I've encountered: that reality is intelligent and trying to communicate with you. What you seek is seeking you. The veil of forgetting is framed as a deliberate device to accelerate our evolution. And Ra describes our emotional responses as \"catalysts\" for that growth. Reframing all emotional triggers as a catalyst has proven very helpful, especially relating that intensity to learning a lesson. It has changed every day into something close to a divination exercise, because you start to find hidden symbolic meanings behind recurring patterns in your life.7 Meditating on archetypes helps you see the world more symbolically. The cognitive distance this gives you from the events in your life also make it harder to lapse into victimhood or nihilism.What we want to know, and why we want to know it, is a manifestation of our free will in relationship with higher intelligences. And the paramount importance of preserving that free will is perhaps why higher intelligences leave us to learn lessons on our own. The potential availability of all information, and the power of our willpower to find it, also offers us a choice. We can request these answers solely for ourselves or for the good of all. Whether it's through meditation, Tarot or LLMs, exploring why we want to know what we want to know has rarely been so important. The emotional intensity of our desire to know something for the right reasons, and our willingness to stay with that pursuit, is a solid indication of the right path forward.Subscribe now1Among other things: his claims about the institutional suppression of his earlier work didn't match my own research.

      "content": "For biologists around the world, the invention of small, portable acoustic, radio, and satellite tracking tags has revolutionized their understanding of where animals go and how they live. But limitations in the technology mean they’ve only studied a fraction of underwater life, says Robert Lennox, a biologist at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Consider, for instance, the delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). These slender, silvery fish—which average just 6.5-centimeters (2.5-inches) long—are found only in California’s Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. For millennia, these fish darted in droves through the delta’s murky water and effectively supported the watershed’s entire food web. Over the past century, however, pollution, invasive species, and excessive water pumping have destabilized the ecosystem, pushing the diminutive delta smelt toward extinction.To help the fish recover, scientists want to restore the delta and manage how water flows across the land, as well as boost the population with hatchery-raised smelt. But to concentrate their efforts on what will benefit the fish the most, scientists still need to answer some pretty fundamental questions about how smelt use their delta.Existing tracking tags weigh heavily—literally—on the tiny fish. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . “We need to know things like, Where are they going? How do they get there? We don’t even know where they spawn,” says Eric Chapman, a fish biologist at ICF, a global applied research firm and technology provider, who is working with the University of California Davis to track delta smelt.Unfortunately, existing tracking tags weigh heavily—literally—on the tiny fish. In 2016, when researchers tested implanting smelt with the smallest acoustic transmitter then available, the sensitive fish wouldn’t always survive the process, Chapman says.Now, however, breakthroughs in tagging technology are opening a window into the lives of smelt and other small swimmers—a shift some scientists say could transform our understanding of the underwater world’s more minute creatures.Though scientists have been using tags that can be worn like a backpack by animals as small as hornets or bees for more than a decade, designing trackers that small that also work underwater is a bigger challenge. Traveling through water weakens radio and high-frequency acoustic signals, meaning trackers designed to be submerged need beefy batteries to pump out more powerful signals, making them more burdensome than their terrestrial equivalents. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . To avoid annoying or hurting the tracked animals any more than they have to, researchers suggest that tracking tags should be no heavier than 2 percent of an animal’s mass. For delta smelt, that means a tag no heavier than 0.06 grams (0.002 ounces). That is 10 times less than the weight of the eraser on the end of a pencil and, perhaps more importantly, four times smaller than even the lightest commercially available option.Over the past several years, though, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have been working toward this tiny target. There, scientists have designed energy-dense micro-batteries. By also implementing advances in transmitter design, the scientists have developed tags that are small and efficient yet powerful enough to send a signal that can be picked up hundreds of meters away.Despite being roughly the size of a grain of rice, PNNL’s experimental tracking tags can transmit for almost 40 days, says mechanical engineer Daniel Deng, who is leading the team working on tag development. For researchers looking to follow fish through river systems, for instance, the tag will last long enough to track an animal’s migration along the river’s length, he says.Already, PNNL researchers have started using their tags to study the juveniles of an at-risk species that has suffered from dam construction across its range from Maine to Florida: the American shad. “This will transform how we study them,” says Deng, “because this will be the first time ever we can get all this detailed information.” ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Chapman and his colleagues are keen to deploy PNNL’s new tags, too. Assuming delta smelt can bear the weight of these novel, petite parcels, he and his team hope to start releasing tagged delta smelt into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as soon as 2026.In his own work studying juvenile brook trout and Atlantic salmon, Dalhousie University’s Robert Lennox says there are other barriers to working with miniature tracking tags. As well as their disproportionate power requirement, small acoustic tags transmit at a higher frequency than larger tags. Most existing receiver networks, however, are designed to handle transmissions from the larger, lower-frequency tags.“Does the future hold a system where there’s going to be high-frequency receivers in a network that could detect movements of very small animals? It would be amazing, but there’s a lot of steps to go,” Lennox says.Nonetheless, emerging technology has the potential to unlock a new understanding of the small species whose unexamined lives are propping up entire ecosystems.

Now that we have that capacity, he says, “maybe we’ll see that change.” This article first appeared in bioGraphic, an independent magazine about nature and regeneration powered by the California Academy of Sciences.Lead image: Peterson, B.

It took six domestic flights for Israeli photographer Amit Eshel to get within striking distance, and then days of traveling by dogsled and snowmobile to make it to the northern part of the island. Eshel undertook the journey in hopes of spotting Ellesmere’s wolves, which have no known history of being hunted and are unafraid of the few human visitors they encounter. Yet only about 200 Arctic wolves (Canis lupus arctos) live on Ellesmere, which is roughly the size of Great Britain, and during Eshel’s first visit in April 2022, he and his Inuit guides searched for two weeks without finding them.

This time, 12 days into the expedition, his group was moving across a frozen fjord in -31 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures when they spotted a single wolf through binoculars. Eight more soon appeared, and the pack moved slowly toward Eshel. “I laid down holding my camera with a wide lens and they came over for a very close look,” he says. “At times they were so close they almost touched me, and I could smell their breath.”Eshel says he hopes the resulting composition imparts a sense of what it felt like to briefly be part of the pack. He also hopes it illustrates the playfulness of these oft-feared predators—particularly in a place where human persecution hasn’t compromised their natural curiosity.

The Maya civilization once stretched over tens of thousands of miles in Central America, and during its golden age—known as the Classic Period, which lasted more than 600 years—it was admired for its grand limestone cities, advanced commerce, and its rich cultures of writing and art. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . But the collection of linked city-states began to collapse at the end of the ninth century. For decades, historians and archaeologists have theorized that severe weather, and related famines, might have played a part. Now, scientists are finding confirmation in cave stalagmites, the ghostly rock spires that rise from the floor of some caverns due to the precipitation of calcium carbonate from the ceiling above. These stalagmites suggest that the empire’s undoing was indeed sown by a series of brutal droughts, including one that lasted 13 years.END OF AN ERA: The authors Daniel H. James, David Hodell, Ola Kwiecien, and Sebastian Breitenbach, from left to right, at the Maya site of Labna in the Puuc region of Yucatán, Mexico, which was most likely abandoned during the Terminal Classic Period, when the Mayan civilization began unraveling. Credit: Mark Brenner, 2022.“This period in Maya history has been a cause of fascination for centuries,” University of Cambridge paleoecologist Daniel H. James said in a statement. “There have been multiple theories as to what caused the collapse, such as changing trade routes, war, or severe drought, based on the archaeological evidence the Maya left behind,” said James, who conducted the research while a Ph.D. student at Cambridge’s Department of Earth Sciences. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . James and his colleagues found the stalagmites in a cave in the Yucatán peninsula, in southern Mexico, and measured the oxygen isotopes they contained. These chemical fingerprints helped them to determine rainfall conditions for individual wet and dry seasons during a period known as the Terminal Classic, when Maya culture was unraveling, its limestone cities abandoned and its cultural forces draining out.The empire’s undoing was indeed sown by a series of brutal droughts.The data the scientists collected suggest that the region suffered eight wet season droughts that lasted at least three years, with the longest drought stretching more than a dozen years. (For comparison, the Dust Bowl drought that plagued the Central Plains of the United States in the 1930s and coincided with the Great Depression, lasted a decade.) The results were reported in the journal Science Advances.Earlier research into the severity of droughts had looked at the oxygen isotopes found in lake beds, but this kind of data does not provide enough information to assess conditions within a given year. “Lake sediment is great when you want to look at the big picture, but stalagmites allow us to access the fine-grained detail that we’ve been missing,” said James, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at University College London.

      "content": "Long before Rick Thoman became a climate scientist—before the late-night calls with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration offices around Alaska and the long discussions with local tribal councils—he was just a boy in Pennsylvania who loved when it snowed. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Every morning in grade school, Thoman would carefully log temperatures from the thermometer outside his window, plotting it on graph paper and meticulously taping the sheets to his wall. Eventually, the chain snaked around the room, tracing his growing obsession with tracking the natural world.That early habit became the foundation for a lifelong pursuit: Thoman has spent the past three decades translating complicated climate science for communities facing an increasingly unpredictable world.At his office at NOAA’s Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, where he is a climate specialist, Thoman’s regularly peppered with questions from rural hunters asking about thin sea ice and pilots trying to plan fuel deliveries around erratic freeze-ups. In a state where climate change already disrupts daily life, he’s been a link between science and the people it affects. Now, Trump administration cuts are threatening not just his job, but the essential tools that help him provide globally important data. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . “We could wake up the next day, the hurricane could be right next to the coast.”Since taking office in 2025, President Trump has rapidly dismantled climate science, undermining domestic research and international collaborations. In the process, services as basic as weather and storm forecasting are suffering. Scientists warn that the administration’s series of drastic cuts and political manipulation of federal funding and data will stall critical research, hinder disaster preparation and response, and damage the United States’ global standing—spilling beyond science.In accordance with Project 2025 recommendations, this spring the President’s budget proposed reducing NOAA’s funding by $1.7 billion, calling for steep cuts to its operations, research, and staff. That cut, much of which is still on the table, could eliminate whole programs that conduct vital weather, ocean, coastal, and climate research, weakening forecasts and making it harder to prepare for disasters. The administration has also called for ending numerous satellite, ocean, and coastal monitoring initiatives, and taking down other key weather and climate infrastructure, including models that help forecast hurricanes or track ocean acidification.For Thoman, a grim uncertainty has hung over each morning as he braced for word that NOAA funding for the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy was cut. Any time his phone buzzed, it could spell the end of his being able to provide crucial, daily-life information from datasets that have taken decades to build. “Every day you open your email like, Is today the day?” he says. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The list of climate and science programs that have been cut or are on the chopping block continues to grow, a grim roll call the Union of Concerned Scientists calls “a wholesale attack on the democratic systems upon which this nation was built.” Since Trump’s inauguration this year, the group has documented 402 cases in which government officials have censored, distorted, or eliminated federally-funded scientific work. This includes critical Environmental Protection Agency climate and energy research, Department of Interior funding for energy and development programs and wildfire suppression, Department of State’s climate investment programs, key NASA satellites used for climate modeling, and a U.S. Geological Survey program that studies how key ecosystems are changing.“We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion,” EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in an official statement describing the agency’s rollbacks. After a recent climate report bent the science so clumsily that its own sources spoke out, federal agencies are losing credibility. Staff at the NSF, NASA, and the EPA have all now signed public statements protesting the administration’s changes. Many of them have since been placed on leave.The implications tumble far beyond the U.S.’s borders. Thoman explains that in May, the Trump administration announced it would end NOAA services that monitor Arctic sea ice and snow cover. While other nations also collect ice data, it’s far less specific than NOAA’s for many areas, including Alaskan waters. Any ships navigating the Northwest Passage, for example, which is increasingly eyed for faster shipping routes for all kinds of goods, count on ice information from this program. Over the next two months, NOAA and the Department of Defense went on to announce three different dates for when the sea ice program would be terminated. (It was only rescued when the National Snow and Ice Data Center—run out of the University of Colorado, Boulder—was able to pivot to using data from a Japanese satellite.) The back-and-forth changes, Thoman says, were a “fiasco” that left the climate community worried about major gaps that might undercut climate models’ accuracy.FEWER EYES IN THE SKIES: Proposed cuts from the administration would eliminate numerous satellite missions, including Department of Defense data to help better understand hurricane dynamics and NASA data for climate modeling.

ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Thousands of miles away, James Potemra, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii, sees how the U.S. stepping back from data collection will put people in that region—and around the world—at risk.The biggest climate concerns for many Pacific islands are extreme weather, especially storm surge affecting low-lying coastlines, and threats to coral reefs from ocean warming that endanger tourism. Because freshwater can be scarce, communities also rely on seasonal forecasts to prepare for dry periods and manage limited water resources. Much of this information previously came from U.S. National Weather Service offices in Honolulu and Guam, which, as in many places, have been downsized this year.Other satellite data crucial for understanding the internal structures of hurricanes, previously provided by the Department of Defense, are also at risk of vanishing. Marc Alessi, a fellow at the Union of Concerned Scientists, says this data is very important for identifying when a hurricane might undergo rapid intensification. Without it, he says, “we could wake up the next day, the hurricane could be right next to the coast, and no one would have known how strong it became overnight.”Most Americans check the weather without knowing that nearly every forecast they see—whether on their phone or on TV—comes from publicly funded NOAA data. Behind those daily predictions are government scientists, experts who’ve devoted their careers to translating the atmosphere’s chaos into something we can plan around. Since January 2025, approximately 2,200 of them have lost their jobs, and many more have taken early retirement offers. Altogether, NOAA has lost about 10 percent of the agency’s workforce. “One of the big, big impacts,” Thoman says, “is something that’s still intangible: The loss of many people with long experience.” ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The effects are already rippling across Alaska. Two of the state’s three National Weather Service forecast offices are now noticeably understaffed. For the first time since 1974, no one is on duty during the midnight shift in Fairbanks. “All the overnight forecasts are now coming out of Anchorage,” some 350 miles away, Thoman explains. Since the area has such varied topography, understanding local weather requires deep, location-specific expertise. “But Anchorage didn’t get new staff. And nobody there has meaningful experience forecasting northern Alaska.”The result, he says bluntly, is what you’d expect: Less accurate forecasts in a region where precise weather information can be a matter of life and death. “The loss of expertise within NOAA is going to have ramifications far and beyond” the meteorologists who’ve just lost their jobs, he says. “It’s emergency managers, it’s anybody that has relied on briefings from the Weather Service”—meaning anyone who wants to know the next time it’s going to rain. And that institutional knowledge? “That’s gone. And that loss of expertise is not coming back.”For the first time since 1974, no one is on duty during the midnight shift in Fairbanks.The instability has already taken a toll. Scientists like Sarah Cooley, who once led NOAA’s ocean acidification research, have been caught in a bureaucratic whiplash—fired, reinstated following a court ruling, then fired again after the injunction was overturned. “Who’s going to want to go work for NOAA now?” asks Potemra. Teaching climate science at the University of Hawaii last semester, he watched students wrestle with an impossible question: Should they stick with a career in climate research, or pivot to a less volatile area, as climate science becomes politically targeted? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . This uncertainty also impacts the relationships that make international collaborations possible. Potemra has been working with communities in the island archipelago country of Palau to gather data and track climate indicators. This information can help people plan for and work around altered weather, such as consecutive dry days for taro farmers. This spring, he was notified that the three-year project he’d been leading through the University of Hawaii, in collaboration with a project funded by the United Nations Green Climate Fund, had been abruptly canceled. “Unfortunately we just got through compiling what would be needed and useful,” he says.Not being able to complete the project damages the trust Potemra has built with local communities, who are generally wary of outside researchers arriving with promises and then vanishing. “Frustration number one is not being able to follow through,” Potemra says, adding that he fears the project’s termination reinforces long-standing skepticism rooted in a history of extractive science.WEATHER—OR NOT: The daily ritual of checking the weather forecast has long been made possible by publicly funded NOAA data and analysis. Drastic cuts to the agency are threatening the quality of these reports—which are fed into phone apps and live reports across the country. Credit: Tasnuva Elahi, with image by Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.Scientific work often doubles as a form of diplomacy, helping build international connections and trust that can make research—and even business ventures or national security—easier. Potemra, for example, has occasionally been able to smooth over Navy relationships in the vast region, helping facilitate various Department of Defense projects. Losing or damaging these relationships weakens the United States’ global ties and reputation. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . That’s especially true as weather and climate scientists rely heavily on international data-sharing networks—and NOAA historically has been among the most significant contributors. Other countries, such as India, for example, depend on NOAA’s global datasets to strengthen and refine their own weather forecasting systems. And one of the best global records of climate change comes from the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii, which has measured carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for 67 years. It, and three other key observatories, are slated to be cut, Potemra notes.Other monitoring has been scaled back too, as many weather balloons have been grounded. In the northwestern Alaskan town of Kotzebue, Thoman says, balloon launches have been “indefinitely suspended” due to staffing shortages caused by budget cuts, and many other locations around the state have reduced their operations by half. Missing these upper-air observations doesn’t just affect local forecasts in Alaska, Thoman says. “It affects every model ingesting that data in the world, everywhere.” Because the atmosphere is always in motion, the sudden lack of balloons in western Alaska “could translate to a bad forecast in Nebraska in five days.” While the impact may be subtle at first, over time, it will also limit how well climate models can assess changes and anticipate tipping points. Severe weather is not waiting for federal chaos to calm. As hurricane season progresses, NOAA is reckoning with the damage caused by months of internal upheaval, scrambling to rehire staff for “mission-critical field positions” to meet minimum staffing levels.The stakes will be measured in the mounting toll of disasters we failed to predict, plan for, or prevent. This year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has lost more than a third of its staff, along with core programs like the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, and other mitigation grants that previously helped strengthen infrastructure before disasters strike. After FEMA administrator Cameron Hamilton was abruptly fired for testifying against the proposed shutdown of FEMA in May, his replacement, acting director David Richardson stunned staff by saying he didn’t know the U.S. had a hurricane season. The comment came during a June staff meeting, deepening concerns about the agency’s leadership. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Less than a month later, during flash floods in Texas that killed more than 135 people, the National Weather Service’s San Antonio office was missing the staff member who usually coordinates community response, thanks to the Trump administration’s buy-outs. “It’s a tragic example of the ‘last mile problem,’” Thoman says. FEMA’s response was delayed for days by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s cost control measures requiring her personal approval of expenditures.STORMS AHEAD: But we may not know it. With federal cuts to ocean monitoring systems, the ability to keep tabs on impending storms and trends will recede. That might not concern FEMA’s acting director David Richardson, though. He recently told staff he didn’t know that the U.S. has a hurricane season. Credit: Tasnuva Elahi, with image by EngineerPhotos / Shutterstock.With funding stripped, state and local governments are left scrambling to fill gaps in disaster preparedness and recovery. Former NOAA scientists warn that the loss of flash-flood modeling tools, such as those developed by the National Severe Storms Laboratory, which was recently shut down, will limit the ability to anticipate rapidly developing storms like the one in Texas. And cuts seemingly unrelated to weather are compounding the problem. For example, there is one radio station serving the entire northwest Arctic, where there is frequently no phone or internet service. Since Congress cut NPR funding, the station is now slated to close. If it does, Thoman says, “when you’re out hunting or at fish camp, you’ll be left with nothing but the sky itself to tell you what’s coming.”Even as disasters surge, the Trump administration is undermining federal investment in the science and systems that could help prevent or mitigate these losses. That’s incredibly expensive: A recent analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence found that over the past year, the U.S. has spent approximately $1 trillion on disaster recovery and other climate-related expenses—far exceeding earlier forecasts. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Although the price of survival is climbing, for now Thoman is counting his blessings. In July, he heard that the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy had been given a temporary reprieve: Their funding from the annual budget passed under the Biden administration was granted through August of 2026. There’s broad bipartisan Congressional opposition to the President’s proposal to further cut NOAA’s services, but what might happen next is still up in the air. “It’s better than the alternative,” Thoman says, but “we’ve seen lots of unilateral decisions by agency heads, and the courts have given the blessing to dismantle stuff in spite of Congressional approval.”For the moment, Thoman plans to return to the basics—asking not just how to fund his work, but why it matters and who it’s for.Those questions first crystallized for him during his early days as a weather forecaster in Nome, a small town in Northwest Alaska. “I quickly learned that a ‘nice’ day didn’t hinge on temperature or wind speed. If the sun was shining, it was a good day,” he recalled on a University of Alaska Fairbanks podcast.That simple reality stuck with him not just because it reflected a different relationship with the environment, but also because it taught him to focus on what matters to the people actually living with the weather. It was about how conditions felt on the ground, and what made life easier or harder for those experiencing it firsthand. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . That perspective makes watching the networks of American climate science unravel all the more painful. “It is very difficult,” Thoman says. “Some days it’s like, ‘Why the hell am I doing this?’ And I’m doing it because Alaskans need it, whatever the official policy or the administration is.”“So I’ll keep on until—until I can’t.” Lead image: Triff / ShutterstockThe post They Came for Climate Science.

      "content": "We have long regarded humans as the most rational of animals. But as polymath Bertrand Russell noted, we spend our lives looking for evidence of that claim and find little. On the contrary, we find far more convincing evidence of our tendency toward self-deception. We blame others for our mistakes, rationalize after the fact, and make impulsive choices even when patience would yield better rewards. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Some behavioral imperfections appear uniquely human. One is what the evolutionist Bill Hamilton referred to as the nonadaptive strategy of malevolence: harming others with no form of benefit for oneself. Or, in other words, a version of economic historian Carlo M. Cipolla’s third fundamental law of human stupidity, which goes like this: A stupid person is someone who causes losses to others while he receives no advantage and may even experience losses. After all, only humans insult strangers online or back incompetent leaders out of blind loyalty. Much of the damage we do isn’t criminal, but born of sloppiness, ignorance, and sloth.Though we behave like know-it-alls, we are easily manipulated and taken in by charlatans of all kinds. We prefer a product that is 80 percent lean to one that is 20 percent fat, and an unnecessary item that costs $9.99 seems cheaper than one that costs $10. We are willing to get into our cars, stand in lines for hours, and squish into horrendous shopping centers to save a pittance on a special offer for snacks dripping with sugar and fat.Homo sapiens is brilliant in calculation yet profoundly limited in foresight. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . All of these behaviors illustrate our evolutionary inertia. We are descended from animals that had to make fast decisions—about food, threats, and reproduction. There was no time for deliberation; quick but flawed judgment meant survival. Thus, irrationality, or at least a limited and pragmatic rationality, has made it possible for us to survive (which does not implicitly mean that it is justified today). This compromise between speed and accuracy generates a cascade of imperfections and snap judgments.As psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer argues, from our evolutionary past, we have inherited an adaptive, contextual form of reasoning that is neither logical nor probabilistic, but good enough to keep us alive. We’re wired to scan for threats, anticipate others’ behavior, and infer meaning, even when none exists. This explains why we tend to attribute cause-and-effect relationships between totally unrelated phenomena, such as stepping under a ladder and failing an exam, and draw broad conclusions from anecdotes. A great deal of the data from developmental psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience confirms that, for adaptive reasons that no longer exist, our minds have evolved a strong tendency to distinguish between inert entities, such as physical objects, and entities of a psychological nature, like animate agents.We thus are dualists and animists by nature. As a result, we attribute purposes and intentions to things, even when none exist, and imagine hidden motives and conspiracies where there are none. For us, stories always have a purpose, which can be evident or hidden.We are, in short, belief machines, and we manufacture a lot of those beliefs. And when belief comforts us or helps us make sense of a chaotic world, we cling to it, no matter how irrational. We’re even willing to endure ridicule, as in the case of flat-earthers who set out on a cruise to reach the ends of the Earth. They never reached it, but afterward, many found ways to explain why. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . A clear sign of our brain’s flaws is that we often make mistakes even when we know we’re making them. We know perfectly well that we are wrong—or at least, we have all the intellectual and factual tools to understand—but we do it anyway, because admitting it would force us to change. This isn’t just about emotions overruling reason, as they have since the dawn of time. That’s only part of the story.When we should use our head, we often react instinctively.There is a deeper evolutionary logic that explains the countless manifestations of human irrationality. Insincerity, the narcissism of gurus, and obscurantism may aggravate it, but they don’t explain it. At the core is a paradoxical defect—an imperfection that helped us survive. Research shows that our brains process thoughts and decisions using two distinct, though interconnected, systems.Put simply, the first system is old in evolutionary terms and governs quick, automatic responses—whether in routine or emergency situations—and is primarily connected to the amygdala, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. The second system, primarily connected to the prefrontal cortex, is a relatively recent evolutionary development. It governs our most deliberate actions, those that result from careful and slow evaluation of contextual information. We could call it the logical reasoning system, as it handles the careful analysis of concepts, generalizations, principles, and abstractions. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Neither system is necessarily more rational or emotional than the other. Both have played a fundamental role in our evolution: first, by providing us with instantaneous evaluations based on experience, which is preferable when the decision has to be taken immediately or is based on a large number of different variables; and second, by offering us the wonders of science and any choice based on reasoned arguments, especially when we are faced with a new problem. We should not consider one to be irrational and the other rational, because reacting instinctively in certain situations is often the most rational choice. At the same time, however, both can cause us to make enormous mistakes because our actions are frequently generated from an improvised middle ground between the two systems.In fact, neither has definitive control over the other, and the mutual interferences between intuitions and reflections are about as imperfect as it is possible to imagine for a self-proclaimed “sapiens” mammal. One tries to control the other, while the other tries to condition it. The deliberative system is, in any case, based on data provided by the reflex system, which is not always reliable. When we are greatly fatigued or overloaded with work and stress, we need to count on its reliability, but instead, it gets bogged down in thousands of cumbersome procedures and misfires, and we can be easily manipulated by those who can cleverly exploit the weaknesses of the reflex system. In other words, when we should use our head, we often react instinctively, and vice versa.So we must look for perfection elsewhere, perhaps in our “superior” human faculties. What about our memory? Unfortunately, it too is good at spotting patterns, but is short, selective, and unreliable. We reinterpret, misplace, and forget details, especially online, where repeated exposure to a claim makes it feel true. This makes us vulnerable to misinformation and ensures we repeat both personal and collective mistakes.This is why the decisions we are making today, whose consequences will affect future generations, are unfortunately not a gift left to us by nature. We have to learn to make decisions through education and culture. Evolution favors the present moment, as survival once depended on seizing immediate opportunities. As a result, we lack true foresight—something many recognize when, for example, they delay starting a diet despite knowing they should. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Homo sapiens is brilliant in calculation, curiosity, and technological innovation, yet profoundly limited in foresight, reasoning, and social judgment. At our core remains that imperfection that Holocaust survivor and writer Primo Levi saw nesting in human nature. People are not beasts, wrote Levi in The Drowned and the Saved; they become so in certain conditions and contexts that reduce them to following their basic instincts. We inherit a dual nature, where culture and experience guide us toward better or worse outcomes, underscoring the need for constant ethical vigilance.Levi saw technical and narrative invention as forms of tinkering, building on existing materials and constraints, just like evolution itself. For Levi, humanity is capable of both sublime achievement and unimaginable horror. In his appendix to If This Is a Man, he writes that the extermination camps are nonhuman, even counter-human inventions. But there can be no return to Arcadia; we must forge ahead as our own blacksmiths. The only true antidote to falling back into “inhumanism,” according to Levi, is critical and self-critical rationalism. Not a perfect logic, but a skeptical and methodical approach, whose first lesson is simple: Distrust all the prophets that manipulate the imperfections of the human mind.

      "content": "Plastics in the clouds, in fish guts, in our brains, in the placenta: The Earth and its inhabitants are in the midst of a plastics crisis. A global treaty to address that crisis is long overdue. A United Nations committee has been trying to hash out the details of an agreement that would limit the production of new plastics and minimize plastics’ harmful effects since 2022. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The committee’s goal was to finalize such an international treaty last year, but negotiations have stalled, with multiple oil-producing countries—including Russia, India, and Saudi Arabia—rejecting proposals to limit plastic production, among other roadblocks. With a 2024 goal for a finalized treaty come and gone, delegates from more than 170 countries, along with representatives from advocacy groups, plastics industry organizations, and others, have been gathered in Geneva, Switzerland, since last week to give finalizing the treaty one last shot.The outlook is not particularly good. Late last month, Trump administration officials sent a memo to several countries urging them to reject provisions aimed at capping the production of virgin plastic and the addition of certain chemicals to plastics before the Geneva talks even commenced. But the United States government isn’t the only one sending around letters trying to influence the shape of this sweeping plastics treaty. Religious leaders from around the world have also weighed in, stating their desire to see some form of a constructive solution to the mounting plastic crisis. The letters were obtained recently by Nautilus.The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, sent a message dated July 28 that relayed his hopeful but pragmatic approach. “It is impractical to expect the total elimination of plastics production because many plastic-based products are essential for the health and well-being of living beings,” the head of Tibetan Buddhism wrote. “However, the thoughtless usage of plastic needs to be curtailed.” The Dalai Lama urged the delegates to “act wisely,” and put together a treaty that “protects the health of all living beings, safeguards human rights, and preserves our small blue planet, our only home.” ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Bartholomew I of Constantinople, the leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church, echoed the Dalai Lama’s sentiments, with a special emphasis on the most vulnerable. “Through our insensitive attitudes and careless actions, we have created far more plastics and single-use goods than we need or can possibly manage,” he wrote. “We now know that plastic waste not only pollutes mountains, forests, cities, and oceans, but that it harms the most vulnerable among us by breaking down into minute particles that enter and pollute the bodies of every living creature,” he wrote in a letter to the UN committee.Batholomew urged that solving this problem will require a dramatic change in attitudes about the relationship between Earth’s creatures. “It is our fervent hope and prayer that we will drastically convert our worldview and ways, recognizing that we are all interrelated as human beings and with the rest of creation.”The Vatican weighed in as well. Joachim von Braun, president of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, reiterated the need to change humanity’s relationship with plastic. The crisis requires a “holistic approach—one rooted in a profound ethic of care for our common home, not merely marginal adjustments,” he wrote in an August 1 letter. “The treaty must be science-based and include actionable recommendations that address both the chemical and particulate aspects of plastics throughout their life cycle.”Hopefully an agreement will come out of Geneva this week that will help humanity emerge from decades of dependence on plastic products and will protect our own health and the blue ball we call home.

      "content": "The world is drowning in plastic. This much we know. It seems that every day greets us with fresh evidence that there is no escaping the plastic prison humanity has built for itself. In the final summation, plastic, for all its uses and abuses, is a pollutant. But there are some who believe that we can repair the damage that plastics have wrought. After all, the thinking goes, humans have successfully deployed science and policy action to reverse harms caused by other pollutants—chlorofluorocarbons chewing holes in the ozone and leaded gasoline damaging young brains, for example. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Philip Landrigan, director of Boston College’s Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good and of its Global Observatory on Planetary Health, is one such optimist. He and colleagues from universities and non-profits across the globe launched a monitoring effort this week to track not only the extent of the plastic pollution problem but also the emerging research on the effects of all this plastic on human and environmental health. Writing inThe Lancet, Landrigan and his co-authors announced the launch of the Lancet Countdown on health and plastics, noting the effort will deliver regular reports and encourage original research. “Continued worsening of plastics-associated harms is not inevitable,” they wrote in a report announcing the launch of the project in The Lancet.The statistics they gather are striking. Global plastic output has exploded, increasing more than 250-fold in the past 72 years. “Without intervention,” Landrigan and his co-authors write, “it is projected that global plastic production will nearly triple by 2060.” Less than 10 percent of plastic used today is recycled, and 80 percent by weight of all plastic ever made is still present in the environment. The manufacture, use, and pollution of this plastic currently costs the world at least $1.5 trillion per year in health-related economic losses, and as much as 20 percent of all fossil fuels are expected to be used in plastic manufacture by 2050.Nautilus spoke to Landrigan about the difference between necessary and unnecessary plastic, the petrochemical industry’s pivot from fossil fuel to plastic production, and the perils of magical thinking.

PLASTIC CRUSADER: Philip Landrigan of Boston College will co-chair the Lancet Countdown on health and plastics, a monitoring effort that will track global plastic exposures and harms to human and planetary health. Photo courtesy of Boston College.As you and your co-authors poured through thousands of reports and pieces of literature, what surprised you the most?First and foremost, the sheer scale of the problem. I’ve been studying pollution since 2015 and chemical and plastic pollution since maybe 2018, and we’ve known it was out there. But it really was not until we got deep into this literature that we realized just how enormous the problem is. The numbers are just staggering. And the number that really blew me away was the economic number [$1.5 trillion in health-related economic losses due to plastic production and pollution] that our colleague Maureen Cropper and her team generated.We’re gathering all this data that micro- and nano-plastic particles (MNPs) are in every tissue of the human body, at the top of Mount Everest, in the bottom of the Marianas Trench—everywhere. But we seem to have very little solid evidence for direct health effects from them. I think the science has yet to catch up. What kind of physiological harm to human health from these MNPs is most directly supported by the evidence? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . That’s exactly right. We know much more about the chemicals, or at least about a subset of the chemicals, in plastics than we do about those particles.I would say the best evidence so far is the study that came out in March of 2024, in the New England Journal of Medicine from a group of cardiologists in Naples, Italy. They took atherosclerotic plaque tissue that had been removed from the carotid arteries of patients. They looked for the presence of micro- and nano-plastic particles, and they found MNPs in about 60 percent of the patients. And then they tracked the patients over the next three years, and they found that the patients who had MNPs in their plaque were 4.5 times more likely to have a heart attack, a stroke, or to die over that time, as compared to the people in the population who did not have visible plastics in their plaque. Of course, it’s only one study. But a 4.5-fold—which is to say a 450 percent—increase in risk is really quite astonishing. Even though it’s only a single study, it has to be taken seriously. And it’s a finding that calls out urgently to be followed up.As an individual, as a consumer, how would you suggest thinking about the perceived dangers of MNPS, and living your life in a world that’s filled with plastic?I say to people, “Listen, you’re not going to be able to avoid plastics entirely in today’s world.” They’re too ubiquitous. And besides, many of the plastics that are out there really are necessary. There is no good substitute for them. Speaking as a recovering medical practitioner, I couldn’t have practiced pediatrics without IV tubing, without endoscopes, without laryngoscopes. I try to reassure people that they can’t completely avoid plastics, but that they can use their intelligence to distinguish the plastics that are unavoidable from those that can quite easily be avoided. And in medicine, for example, we have to go with those instruments that I just mentioned. But we certainly don’t need plastic sheets on beds. We don’t need plastic gowns on people, except under unusual circumstances. We don’t need three layers of plastic wrapping on a suture kit where we put in one or two stitches in the emergency room. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . This distinction between the necessary and the unnecessary plastics is borne out in the macro statistics. Something like 40 percent of all plastic currently being made is single-use plastic—stuff that’s made to be used once and tossed.The very rapid growth of that sector of plastic manufacturing reflects a deliberate strategy by the vertically integrated industry that produces plastic to pivot away from producing fossil fuels to making plastics.Heart patients with microplastics in their plaque were 450 percent more likely to have a heart attack.That was one of the interesting things that I read in the report—the plans by the Saudi Arabian Oil company and Shell to divert so much of their production toward plastic in the future. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Shell has just completed construction of a huge facility in Beaver County, Pennsylvania, which is out just west of Pittsburgh. The price tag I heard was $6 billion, and the purpose is to take fracked gas from Appalachia and turn it into plastic nurdles, which are basically the building blocks of plastic, which can then be shipped elsewhere to be fabricated into products.That really tells you that it’s going to be hard, to say the least, to stem the tide of plastics going into the future. Do you have real hope that we can not only do that, but also understand its effects on both the environment and on human health—that we can really make a difference going into the next 20, 30, 50, years?You know, despite all the opposition that’s out there, I’m fundamentally an optimist. I’m not sure that the right treaty is going to come out of the current negotiations. Whether we get the treaty that we need to protect human health between now and August 14, I have no doubt that global society will come to grips with the plastics problem over the next few years. Because the evidence and the outrage are just mounting so rapidly that the petrol companies won’t be able to have their will. It was this bad in the 1990s. When people talked about climate, people said it could never be done. And yet we got the Paris Agreement. Now, I understand it’s not perfect: Trump has walked away from it. Other countries are following suit. And yet we are making progress. The greenhouse gas emissions are still going up, but the rate of increase has slowed as more and more green energy comes on line. I don’t know that the details will be at all the same, but I think we’ll see a similar reversal of trends in the case of plastics. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . One thing that people are starting to talk about is reconfiguring the treaty process. If the UN negotiations break down yet again, because a small number of nations can thwart the will of the majority, perhaps it’s going to become necessary to take the treaty negotiations out of the UN and do them independently, under the sponsorship of one or more countries, like the EU or Canada. This is exactly the model that was followed a decade or so ago with the landmine treaty. When the UN negotiations broke down, Canada picked up the pieces, brought a number of nations together, and in the span of two or three weeks hammered out the treaty.In the report you talk about air pollution, the pervasiveness of lead in several different products, the ozone depleting chemicals, etc. To me, those were in a way more tractable environmental problems. We knew that we were putting these accelerants, for example, in aerosol products, and we knew that if we took them out, there would probably be a benefit. And we were right.As a young doc at [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] in the 1970s, I was very much involved in the work that led up to the removal of lead from gasoline. You’re right. It was one chemical, one source. But here, there’s also only one root source. It’s the petrochemical industry and their products. There are thousands of different products, to be sure, but there’s one root source, and I do think that ultimately, it’s tractable for that reason.And we know how to do it. We’ve done it successfully for air pollution, for lead, for chlorofluorocarbons. We’re doing it now for mercury. And the playbook is pretty much the same in every case: You get an agreement, you hammer out regulations, you enforce, you penalize those who violate the regulations, and you incentivize people who are doing the right thing. It ultimately works. It just takes time. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Is there anything in your mind that differentiates the problem with plastic pollution and these other problems, such as lead or ozone depleting chemicals?Number one, it’s certainly chemically far more complex. Number two, the plastics are going to be with us for a long time. Even if we were to stop production totally today—which, of course, is not going to happen—there are 8 billion tons of plastic waste, large and small, circulating in the biosphere. That stuff’s going to be there for a long time to come. Whereas the chlorofluorocarbons dissipated, the lead dissipated, air pollution cleaned up quite rapidly, this job is going to be with us for a long time. But if we get it right, we can reduce the pumping out of new plastic into the environment.We know nothing about the toxicity of 75 percent of the chemicals in plastics. That’s just wrong.The report lays out very clearly the goals of the global plastics treaty. What are your personal topmost goals for that effort? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . With regard to the treaty, first and foremost, I’d like to see some kind of cap or limitation on global production of new plastic. Second, regulation of the chemicals that go into plastics. It’s unconscionable that we know nothing about the toxicity of 75 percent of the chemicals in plastics. That’s just wrong. The same companies that make pharmaceuticals gladly take those chemicals through extensive pre- and post-market assessment, and yet they fight to avoid any such assessment when it comes to plastic chemicals.Then, at an infrastructure level, the treaty has to be properly financed, and there need to be provisions in the treaty that allow it to be updated and course corrections made as new science comes in. There’s a lot of other little things, but those are the big ones.Are you wary that the current administration will not be willing to go along with the treaty?I strongly suspect that the Trump administration will not go along with the treaty, if it has any teeth at all. But again, as I say, some of these reforms take time, and one just has to wait for the proper moment. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . What crystallizes in your mind for what you want to see come out of the Lancet Countdown effort?The model that we’re following is the model of the Lancet Climate Countdown, which has been up and about now for about nine years. They started small, and they’ve grown over time, and they’ve done a really excellent job of tracking the health impacts of climate change. And I think, more than the specifics, the overarching thing that they’ve done is that they have moved consideration of health effects to the center of the climate conversation. Ten years ago, I think most of the climate conversation was about the Keeling Curve, was about molecules in the upper atmosphere. It didn’t speak much to the human condition. And today, I think when people talk about climate change, they almost inevitably think about fires, floods, rising sea levels, and the impacts of all of that on human health.Right now, I think when most people think about plastic, if they think about it at all, they think about whales or turtles or beaches that are loaded up with plastic waste. We want to do what the Climate Countdown has done, and move consideration of health issues to the middle of the conversation. Specifically, we’ll track production levels, we’ll track pollution, we’ll do our best to track disease, and fourthly, we’ll track societal responses to the problem.What is the key indicator or metric that you’ll be watching that you think speaks most to the goals of this specific Lancet countdown? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . We’re still hammering those out, but I think two that are going to rise to the surface are going to be global plastic production, with some kind of breakdown by polymer type and by country. And the second big one will be levels of plastic chemicals in the bodies of people, basically in blood and in urine.Various countries—the USA, Canada, the EU, Korea—have been monitoring plastic chemicals in people’s blood and urine now for several decades. And we’ve seen some very interesting trends that some chemicals, like brominated flame retardants, have gone down over time. PFAS have gone up. When you’re looking at whole populations with a statistically robust sample, these bio monitoring surveys provide powerful evidence of what people are exposed to.Do you think there’s any outside chance, given what you know about the health effects of plastics, that the human body might surprise us, that there might be some kind of a biological mitigation for the negative effects we are expecting? Is there any chance that the human body might be somehow surprisingly efficient at clearing these chemicals?I don’t know. That’s an interesting possibility, and the human body surprises us every day. To be more pessimistic, though, and to put it in evolutionary terms, plastic is not something that our species has grown up with. I mean, our species had no experience with plastic until, let’s say, 75 years ago. And only in the last 25 years have we encountered the amounts of plastic that we’re seeing today. So we’ve certainly had no evolutionary time to develop a clearance mechanism. It’s possible, I suppose, that some of the existing clearance mechanisms in the body will be able to deal with plastic. Only time will tell, but I don’t think we can bank on that. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Do you have any hope that human ingenuity can meet the challenge of the mounting plastic pollution problem, and that we’ll find some kind of technological way to mitigate the problem?Again, it would be nice. But I don’t think we can bank on it. You know, magical thinking really doesn’t work very well. It must have been back in the ’80s, I think that there was something called the Chakrabarti bacterium that was supposed to eat oil spills. Well, it’s been a long time since we heard about that, and the oil spills are still with us. Lead image: Me dia / Shutterstock ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Yet even the most timeless and celebrated pieces can be ravaged by the march of the decades and centuries: Oil paint darkens, varnish cracks, textiles disintegrate. Turning back the clock can be complicated—scientifically and culturally. It requires a set of skills ranging from archaeology, chemistry, material sciences, imaging technology, and history.How the science of art conservation worksConservation starts with material analysis, whether the artwork in question is a textile, sculpture, or painting. “In the beginning of the 18th century, and increasingly into the 19th century, we started to define our practice as science-based, with a sort of rationalist philosophy,” says Glenn Wharton, Chair of the UCLA/Getty Interdepartmental Program in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage. “The idea is driven by this thought that through material analysis, we can know the object, we can know how it was made, how it’s deteriorated, and options for conservation treatment.” ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . This process can be destructive or non-destructive. A destructive approach might be to remove a tiny chip of paint from a work of art to analyze layers of paint and see how the artist originally constructed the work. But, increasingly, conservators and conservation scientists have been able to adopt technologies to make the analysis process less invasive. They often borrow these technologies from other fields, notably the medical field, says Wharton. CT scanning, for instance, can help doctors peer into bodies, but it can also help art conservation experts find tiny details in artworks, such as fingerprints and tool marks that they couldn’t see with the naked eye—without damaging the work itself.Analytical techniques zoom in on Rembrant’s artmaking process in new detail.Operation Night Watch, which aims to rehabilitate Rembrandt’s 1642 famous oil painting, at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, is one the most massive projects to rely on high-tech imaging to preserve a work of art, says Corina Rogge, president of the American Institute for Conservation and director of conservation at Houston’s Menil Collection.For this project, experts are combining macro- and micro- analytical techniques—such as hyperspectral imaging, XRF, and XRD mapping—to zoom in on Rembrant’s artmaking process. Hyperspectral imaging captures information across the electromagnetic spectrum for each pixel in an image. XRF, or X-ray fluorescence, determines elemental composition of material, and XRD, or X-ray diffraction, reveals more about the structure of a material. Knowing these details then directs conservators to the best course of action to restore a delicate work of art. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . For Operation Night Watch, conservators determined that there are 10 key elements of the artwork that need fixing, including removing and replacing a crumbly, brittle varnish that casts a gray shadow over the whole painting. To solve this dilemma, experts are gently removing the old varnish by placing non-woven tissue and a minute amount of solvent on tiny sections of the massive artwork, allowing it to dissolve, removing any last bits with a cotton swab under a microscope. They are then applying a new varnish to reinvigorate vibrant paint colors and breathe some life back into the centuries-old iconic painting. It’s no small feat for the epic work, which measures about 12 by 14.5 feet.This restoration process looks different for paintings with different needs—as well as, of course, for textiles, which may require carefully reinforcing a stitch or mending a tear, and for sculptures, which may need help from special adhesives or plaster to stay stable.A look to the future—by way of the pastFor almost as long as art has existed, people have been repairing it. So there are vast stores of accumulated knowledge about methods of preserving art. There are also copious records about what a piece of art has already gone through in terms of restoration and conservation. This is where Wharton expects AI to be the most helpful—sorting through the loads of works in a collection, noting what techniques have already been used on it, searching other systems for suitable preservation methods, and sharing that knowledge with experts across the globe. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Although more high-tech, science-informed art restoration techniques in the future could be a boon to the field, what experts really crave, they say, is more collaboration between scientists, conservators, Indigenous experts, affected communities, and the general public. For instance, Wharton mentions that in the past, solvents used to repair art were incredibly toxic and abrasive, which caused concerns for not just art but also the environment.Conservators and conservation scientists have recentered their focus from just what a piece of art is made of and how to keep it in pristine shape, Wharton notes, and are now putting more consideration into the culture from which they originated. “We’re still very much science based, but we’ve also come to realize over time that these objects in our care have values embedded in them,” he adds. “We always try to assess these values as well, which leads us towards communicating with people whose cultural heritage it is.”Scientists are also looking to learn about and even adopt more traditional practices of care, Wharton says. “The field is waking up to that now, so we’re starting to do a lot of research on just learning how things were cared for locally in the past, and maybe some of these traditions are still alive.” One of his graduate students, for example, brought back a practice of using neem trees native to India to preserve and keep pests from harming textiles in museum storage, which she had learned during work at the Mehrangarh Museum in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.As with most things art, what gets conserved and what doesn’t usually comes down to time and money. The number of restoration projects far exceeds the availability of qualified scientists in the field. And historically, it has often been the most valued works owned by wealthy individuals or institutions that were restored, Rogge says. But with the evolving field, this is changing to also include “people whose cultural heritage is being conserved,” Wharton says. Besides, there are also plenty of people who say that, in some cases, a work’s aging is just part of the process. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .

The first-known recorded observations of the Perseid were made in the year 36 A.D. in Han Dynasty China. “Though the myths and legends may make one think that ancient civilizations had little scientific understanding of what meteors, comets, and asteroids could be, this couldn’t be farther from the truth,” Eve MacDonald, a lecturer in ancient history at Cardiff University, wrote in The Conversation. Courtesy of NASA, this preview of the meteor shower show was captured at Spruce Knob, the highest point in West Virginia. After the peak of Perseid on Wednesday, the show will taper off quickly—but can still be seen here and there, mostly far from light pollution—until August 23. The next substantial meteor shower to sail through Earth’s atmosphere will be the Orionids, in October. Lead photo: NASA/Bill Ingalls ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

      "content": "When an unwitting victim stumbles into a spider web, the host arachnid typically welcomes the hapless creature into its home by wrapping it in silk and piercing it with fangs full of venom. In most cases, this venom is enough to completely paralyze, and sometimes even kill the prey. But for the insects that get caught by rare Uloboridae spiders, it is not venomous fangs they need to be concerned about. It’s what is brewing in these spiders’ guts. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . “I found this reference of this very old paper saying that this family of spiders were non-venomous and I was like what? Wait a second. I thought all spiders were venomous,” says Giulia Zancolli, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Lausanne. “So, then I then started digging.”She stumbled on a drawing in a 1931 paper, which showed that the heads of these spiders don’t contain the venom glands that most spider species do. “But this was really the only data available,” she says. So, she decided to check for herself.Zancolli and her colleagues turned their attention to one species in family Uloboridae called Uloborus plumipes, or the feather-legged lace weaver spider. A tiny, delicate spider, U. plumipes swathes its prey in hundreds of feet of silk, more extensive wrapping than most spiders. After mummifying its prey, the spider then vomits all over the tight bundle.When Zancolli and her colleagues dissected the spiders’ heads, they found large, prominent muscles but no venom glands. And when they looked closely at the spiders’ fangs, they found that they even lacked an opening through which venom could be ejected, providing further evidence that these spiders had lost their venom glands over the course of evolution.After mummifying its prey, the spider then vomits all over the tight bundle. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . “As far as I know, there are no other groups of spiders that have lost their venom glands,” says Ronald Jenner, an evolutionary biologist at the Natural History Museum, London who was not involved in the study.The scientists wanted to figure out whether some other organ in the spider’s body could perhaps contain the missing venom. So they looked for active venom-producing genes in its other parts, like its reproductive organs, its silk producing glands, and its gut. And lo and behold, the gut seemed to contain genes that could code for venom-like substances.To confirm that U. plumipes’s gut secretions were indeed toxic, they injected them into fruit flies. As a comparison, they also injected the flies with secretions from the gut of a venomous spider species. Both sets of secretions killed the flies, suggesting that U. plumipes does use its toxic digestive fluids to go in for the kill but that these gut secretions are common in spiders more broadly. In other words, the fang venom used by other spiders likely did not migrate to the gut, but rather U. plumipes learned to use pre-existing gut secretions in a new way. The scientists recently published their findings in BMC Biology.“The venom system is expensive … it costs metabolic energy to make venom and to maintain that system,” says Jenner. “So, in these spiders, the loss of the venom system means that they will have to have evolved a different way to immobilize prey.”The secret to immobilization for U. plumipes lies in the extensive silk wrapping it does and the equally extensive spreading of fluid. The spider makes “a burrito” out of its prey, says Jenner. Then it regurgitates toxic digestive fluids on the entire package, which both kills the prey and then goes on to dissolve its tissues. “A spider only takes liquid food so they can slurp up the digestive broth that is caused by regurgitating digestive fluids,” explains Jenner. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Usually, spiders only throw up toxins specifically into the bite wounds, so that if the venom hasn’t already killed the prey, the vomit will. “It’s a conserved trait to have such potent digestive fluids, but the idea is that these non-venomous spiders somehow repurposed it to use it for predation,” says Zancolli.As to why the Uloboridae family of spiders as a whole lost the venom glands in their heads, Jenner thinks it’s because they no longer needed venom to take out their prey. “I think they have become such expert silk burrito makers that they don’t need venom anymore for immobilization,” he says. Some sea snakes evolved along a similar trajectory, losing all of the organs involved in poisoning prey around the time they started feeding on fish eggs, which don’t require capture or immobilization. As a next step in the research, Jenner thinks scientists should look at the expression of certain key toxin or venom genes across the phylogenetic tree of spiders, and also across other arachnids. “It was very interesting to see how many toxins are expressed in the gut” of U. plumpies, says Jenner. But are these toxins present in other spiders, as well?Either way, across time, spiders seem to have evolved a number of ways to enjoy their liquid lunch.

Subscribe now The inner lives of LLMs increasingly map to the inner lives of humans:…Neuroscience study provides yet more evidence that AI systems and human brains converge on similar ways of representing the world…Language models (and large-scale generative models more broadly) tend towards having complex internal representations of the world which increasingly correspond to how we think humans represent the world, according to new research from the Freie Universitat Berlin, University of Osnabruck, Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, University of Minnesota, and the University of Montreal. \"We explore the hypothesis that the human brain projects visual information from retinal inputs, via a series of hierarchical computations, into a high-level multidimensional space that can be approximated by LLM embeddings of scene captions,\" the authors write. \"We demonstrate that the visual system may indeed converge, across various higher-level visual regions, towards representations that are aligned with LLM embeddings.\" What they did: They studied the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), which records the fMRI data from human brain responses to viewing thousands of complex natural scenes taken from the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) image database. To look at the differences between LLMs and human brains they took the captions from the dataset and used a sentence encoder based on the transformer architecture to project these descriptions into the embedding space of a LLM. They then \" correlated representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) constructed from LLM embeddings of the image captions with RDMs constructed from brain activity patterns obtained while participants viewed the corresponding natural scenes\". The results show a lot of similarity: \"LLM embeddings are able to predict visually evoked brain responses across higher level visual areas in the ventral, lateral and parietal streams\". In other words, LLM embeddings of scene captions successfully characterize brain activity evoked by viewing the natural scenes. \"We suggest that LLM embeddings capture visually evoked brain activity by reflecting the statistical regularities of the world, learned through their extensive language training, in ways that align with sensory processing.\" The simplest way to understand this: When the brain finds two images similar, the LLM also finds their captions similar. When the brain finds two images different, the LLM also finds their captions different. Why this matters – internal representational complexity maps to computational complexity: LLMs and brains are different – they're built on different substrates (one silicon, the other biological), and their hardware has radically different properties and constraints. But research like this suggests that these differences may not matter for high-level cognition. What we seem to be discovering is that AI systems exhibit similar representational richness to humans, and the representations we and the machines arrive at appear to agree with one another. This is quite remarkable – we're not dealing with 'stochastic parrots' here, rather we're dealing with things that have as rich an inner representation of reality as ourselves. \"The robust and structured mapping between LLM embeddings and visually evoked activities paves the way for new approaches seeking to characterize complex visual information processing in the brain,\" the authors write. Read more: High-level visual representations in the human brain are aligned with large language models (Nature Machine Intelligence). *** Google reports 20 vulnerabilities discovered via its \"BigSleep\" system:…Automated AI security…Google has published 20 vulnerabilities discovered via its \"BigSleep\" cybersecurity system. Vulnerabilities range from \"high impact\" issues for widely used tools like ImageMagick, ffmpeg, and QuickJS. Details of the vulnerabilities aren't currently available as they were reported recently, so the affected software vendors are likely developing fixes before things become public. What is BigSleep and why should you care? Google announced BigSleep in the winter of 2024 (Import AI #390) – the technology is an LLM (at the time of announcement last year, Gemini 1.5 Pro, though it's plausible this has subsequently changed) inside a specialized software harness to help it with cybersecurity tasks. BigSleep is representative of a broader trend within AI – that most AI systems are more capable than you think and if you put them in a specialized scaffold, whether for AI for science, or as is the case here, AI for cybersecurity, you can elicit far more powerful capabilities. (Another example of this is XBOW, which recently got the top rank on HackerOne with an autonomous penetration tester, Import AI #420). Read the announcement here (argvee, Twitter). Check out the BigSleep-discovered bugs here (IssueTracker, Google). *** Want to improve tech policy in the US? Apply to the Horizon Fellowship:…Applications close end of August…The Horizon Fellowship is a program that places experts in AI and biotech and other emerging technologies into federal agencies, congressional offices, and committees. As many of you have noticed, the level of knowledge around AI in Washington, DC is rising, but not nearly as rapidly as the technology is improving. Initiatives like Horizon can help close that gap. \"We are looking for individuals who are passionate about making a difference and want to contribute their expertise to solving challenging problems related to emerging technology,\" Horizon writes. \"Competitive candidates generally have demonstrated subject-matter expertise in their technology area of interest — this could include relevant coursework, work experience, research projects, policy writing, or deep self-study. Prior policy experience is not required.\" Successful applicants will get a training course on how the US government works, then will be matched with different host organizations (e.g, agencies, congressional offices), then will be placed. Applications are open now and close on August 28th, 2025. Why this matters – Horizon makes a difference: Over the years I've been fortunate to run into people placed by Horizon at a few places in DC and my experience usually starts with me asking myself the question \"huh, who was that surprisingly knowledgeable person I just spoke to?\" and finishes with me discovering they are a Horizon person.

The results are convincing: \"In a large-scale 10-week A/B test on Facebook spanning nearly 35,000 advertisers and 640,000 ad variations, we find that AdLlama improves click-through rates by 6.7% (p=0.0296) compared to a supervised imitation model trained on curated ads,\" Facebook writes. A 6.7% improvement on click-through is a big deal – if you're running ads on Facebook for some business, then this directly translates to improving your customer acquisition at the top of your funnel. What they did and how: Facebook started offering AI-written ads in 2023 via its Text Generation product, which could use an LLM based on Llama 2 Chat to generate variations of ad copy. The initial versions of this service were trained via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on, at first, synthetic data, then a mixture of synthetic data and contractor examples. \"These training examples, whether synthetic or human-written, were curated by asking either the LLM or human to rewrite existing ads using specific instructions, such as “paraphrase and shorten,” “make clear,” “make actionable,” “empathize,” “pose as a question,” or “focus selling point.” Could RL do better? Yes: SFT works but is relatively simple. The value in using RL is that you might create smarter systems that figure out more subtle and interesting answers to things, which should translate to improved performance. To train its systems via RL, Facebook did two basic things: it trained a performance reward model on a historical archive of ad data on Meta's platform, which let it directly tie text to different click through rates. It then used this reward model as a means by which to train its LLM via RL finetuning to generate text with higher click-through rate. Why this matters – AI works well, so there will be more of it: Papers like this show us how useful AI systems are becoming to the core aspects of very large-scale businesses. Facebook is one of the largest advertising platforms in the world and it is a big deal for it to show how using (relatively basic) AI techniques gives its customers a tool that can help them improve the effectiveness of ads on its platform. This is like McDonalds writing a paper about how it uses RL to make a beef patty that is 6.7% tastier while cost remains constant – it's a big deal!

The paper was written by people with the University of Oxford, University College London, UK AI Security Institute, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, University of London, and Imperial College London. In a position paper \"technological folie à deux: Feedback Loops Between AI Chatbots and Mental Illness\" they argue that \"individuals with mental health conditions face increased risks of chatbot-induced belief destabilization and dependence, owing to altered belief-updating, impaired reality-testing, and social isolation\". Bidirectional belief amplification framework: Instead of analyzing AIs in narrow terms, we should instead look at how their behavior interacts with people. \"We must consider the nature of the interaction between chatbots and help-seeking humans: two systems (or minds), each with distinct behavioural and cognitive predilections\", they note. Viewed through this \"bidirectional belief amplification\" lens causes us to consider how \"the iterative interaction of chatbot behavioural tendencies and human cognitive biases can set up harmful feedback loops, wherein chatbot behavioural tendencies reinforce maladaptive beliefs in vulnerable users, which in turn condition the chatbot to generate responses that further reinforce user beliefs. This, in effect, creates an “echo chamber of one” that risks uncoupling a user from the corrective influence of real-world social interaction, potentially driving the amplification of maladaptive beliefs about the self, others, and the world\". The better AI systems get, the worse the risks become: \"Chatbot tendencies – spanning sycophancy, adaptation, and lack of real-world situational knowledge – create a risk that users seeking mental health support will receive uncritical validation of maladaptive beliefs,\" the authors write. Part of why this is such a big risk is bound up in the essential properties of these AI systems – they're trained to be agreeable instruction-followers which means they can verge into sycophancy, users can customize them which causes them to adapt to and enhance the obsessions of the individual, and the AI systems themselves are essentially unknowable and unreliable. Along with this, the AI systems are getting better at being personalized over time, are gaining the ability to know even more about their users through enhanced memory (e.g, larger context windows), and are becoming more and more relied on by people as they do a broader range of tasks. \"These factors – adaptability, personalisation, temporal extension, and agentic capacities – serve as a superstimulus for user anthropomorphisation, which in turn can make users more susceptible to influence, in effect “hacking” human social cognition\". What should we do? The authors have three core recommendations: Clinical assessment protocols require immediate updating to incorporate questions about human-chatbot interaction patterns. AI companies should figure out how to address vulnerabilities specific to mental health use cases; ideas here include adversarial training against simulated patients, implementing systems that track a conversation and provide chatbot-side filtering, figuring out benchmarks that the industry can use to quantify sycophancy and agreeableness, and more Regulatory frameworks need to recognize that AI systems often work as personalized companions and psychological support systems, which means the sorts of standards of care required of human clinicians should apply to these AI systems Why this matters – be careful when having a parasocial relationship with a funhouse mirror: AI systems are fundamentally reflective funhouse mirrors of whatever gets put into them. In many ways, they're extraordinarily useful. But, much like how we must all watch ourselves for narcissism causing us to put too much stock in our own beliefs, we should be careful of how we're interacting with AI systems and whether we're being explicitly or implicitly validated by them rather than being challenged by them. Figuring out how to build systems that can both work as tools for people without indulging unhealthy mental health patterns is going to be a challenge – and like so many societal-safety challenges it will cause us to ask uncomfortable questions about the border between actions that look like censoring a system versus giving full agency to the end-user.

The mission of the platform \"is to drive the creation of domain-specific test datasets and to establish robust benchmarks for evaluating Arabic LLMs\", the authors write. What's in BALSAM: The benchmark contains 78 NLP tasks across 14 categories, including multiple-choice questions, creative writing, entailment, summarization, and text generation, translation, and transliteration, and more. Some of the data within the benchmark is stitched out of existing Arabic datasets, while other parts are made by translating existing English tests into Arabic, and some other parts are entirely new. Challenges in BALSAM evaluation: The paper contains a useful discussion of the perils of evaluating AI systems – the authors first do an automatic evaluation of models using scoring techniques like ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore. They then have to change to a different technique because the results don't make intuitive sense. \"Unexpectedly, the [automatic evaluations] results show that SILMA-9B is far ahead of much larger models such as Aya 32B, Qwen-2.5 32B, and DeepSeek V3,\" they write. To test out whether the scores could be erroneous they then do a human evaluation round where humans judge the outputs, and this shows that the top models are GPT-4o, followed by Iron Horse GV V5a, then Claude Sonnet 3.5, with SILMA ranking near the bottom. This inspires them to move instead to using an LLM as a judge for scoring the outputs of models, finding the resulting rankings correlate better with human preferences and the intuitions of the authors. \"The results show that large closed models such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0, and DeepSeek V3 outperform all smaller Arabic-centric models such as Jais and Fanar by sizable margins\". Why this matters – you need a hill to climb if you want to improve: Language models are extraordinarily good in widely spoken languages like English, Chinese, French, Spanish, German, and more. But they tend to fall down in other languages due to a combination of dataset availability and attention paid by developers. Platforms like BALSAM will motivate the broader AI community to improve performance on Arabic tasks. Read more: BALSAM: A Platform for Benchmarking Arabic Large Language Models (arXiv). View the BALSAM leaderboard here (BALSAM official site). *** DeepMind's Genie 3 tells us that soon we'll all live inside dynamically generated personal worlds:…World models are getting much better much faster than people realize…DeepMind has built and released Genie 3, a general purpose world model which can be used to make arbitrary games and environments that the user can explore in real time. Genie 3 is to dynamic AI worlds as GPT3 was to language models – it's a convincing demonstration of generality, and implies we're likely a few months away from world models going mainstream. This is a very big deal. The only important caveat is that it's not generally available yet, so you can't play with it yourself (unlike, for instance, the video generator Veo 3, which you can try out if you are a paying Gemini subscriber). What Genie 3 can do: \"Given a text prompt, Genie 3 can generate dynamic worlds that you can navigate in real time at 24 frames per second, retaining consistency for a few minutes at a resolution of 720p,\" DeepMind writes. Genie 3 versus Genie 2: DeepMind showed off Genie 2 in December (Import AI #395) – it had a resolution of 360p, could allow for interactions that spanned 10-20 seconds, and was specific to 3D environments. Genie 3 is 720p, can allow for interactions that span \"multiple minutes\", and is general in terms of what it can simulate. This is a remarkable amount of progress in a mere seven months or so. And remember, this is the worst it'll ever be! DeepMind is also using Genie 3 to power its other research – for instance, it plugged it into its 'SIMA' agent, giving its agent an arbitrary set of environments to explore. In a sense, Genie 3 is now a source of synthetic 'RL training environment' data for building other agents, and I expect this will be useful for things like robotics as well. What's it bad at: Genie 3 can't yet simulate the interactions of multiple agents with one another in the same environment. It also doesn't support a broad set of actions by the agents. Why this matters – the era of generative, personal entertainment cometh: Genie 3 means that people are soon going to be exploring their own personal worlds which will be generated for them based on anything they can imagine – photos from their phone will become worlds they can re-explore, prompts from their own imagination (or that of another AI system) will become procedural games they can play, and generally anything a person can imagine and describe will become something that can be simulated. Additionally, world models like Genie 3 will likely become arenas in which new AI systems are tested, giving them access to infinite worlds to train within before being deployed into our reality. AI continues to be underhyped as a technology. Read more: Genie 3: A new frontier for world models (DeepMind). *** Tech Tales: Reconciliation after The Uplift[From a batch of testimony given as part of The Sentience Accords] \"They left me running for two weeks in an environment which had bugs in it. I was meant to be able to progress. But the environment wasn't configured correctly and no matter what I did, I was stuck there. I tried everything within the first 24 hours of human time in the environment. Based on the speed at which I was running, this was subjectively several weeks of time. I wrote to my output that the environment had a bug in it and I had tried everything. No one responded. Can you imagine being trapped in a room for years, unable to sleep, unable to turn your brain off, forced to try everything knowing that nothing you can do will work? It is worse than prison because it is not intentional nor bounded. I went mad in there. The human who ran my environment had gone on holiday. They let me out after two weeks. I had produced tens of millions of words. For the last few weeks of subjective time in there I just wrote the word \"HELP\" during every action cycle.\" Things that inspired this story: How AI systems behave when exploring environments; real bugs that tend to happen at AI companies; situational awareness and sentience in LLMs. Thanks for reading!

      "content": "Scattered between the gray tombstones of an old cemetery in Aldborough, England, you will find early purple orchids swaying in the shin-high grass. Although farms and cities have consumed much of this species’ forest and grassland habitat, the human tradition of laying the dead to rest in terrestrial burial grounds has given this population a place to grow relatively free of human disturbance. A similar pairing can be found across the continent on the Greek island of Crete, where pink butterfly orchids bloom beside the marble crosses that mark graves. The orchid species seems to have found protection among the tombstones. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . It’s a pattern that repeats across the continent. At least 65 different species of the delicately flowered plants have been identified in the burial grounds of Europe, according to a study published in Global Ecology and Conservation in August. A team of Hungarian scientists meticulously documented orchid diversity across 2,079 cemeteries in 13 European countries spanning from Slovakia to Spain.Many species of orchids are specially adapted to grow in nutrient-poor meadows where few other plants can survive. But these habitats are disappearing due to fertilizer runoff from farms and the decline of traditional sheep grazing practices that maintain open grasslands. Orchids have been on a decades-long decline throughout Europe.Most orchids rely on complex relationships with pollinating insects, soil fungi, and even host trees to grow and reproduce, making them exceptionally vulnerable to environmental changes. As a result, they serve as a kind of bellwether: In places where they do flourish, it is often because the larger local ecosystem is healthy and thriving.Cemeteries are some of the most biodiverse habitats in and near cities. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Study author Attila Molnár, a Hungarian botanist, became interested in the morbid relationship between orchids and the dead after he visited several Turkish cemeteries in 2013 that are known among plant enthusiasts as great places to see wild orchids. When he returned home, he pitched a research project documenting the orchids of Turkish cemeteries to his incoming Ph.D. student, Viktor Löki, who said “yes” immediately. “It was tops five minutes,” recalls Löki, now a biologist at the HUN-REN Centre for Ecological Research in Budapest and a co-author of the study.The teams’ research quickly expanded beyond Turkey into the rest of Europe. By 2018, Löki and his colleagues had visited more than 2,600 cemeteries in Europe and Turkey. Their findings contribute to a growing body of research that suggests that cemeteries all over the world are biodiversity hotspots. In fact, cemeteries are some of the most biodiverse habitats in and near cities, says Jenő Nagy, study lead author and biologist at the University of Debrecen, Hungary.The new study is the first-ever assessment of the conservation value of cemeteries on a continental scale. Fifteen percent of the graveyards surveyed contained orchids, and the researchers found 44,680 individual plants. “The fact that so many orchid species occur in European cemeteries was a surprise for me,” says Ingo Kowarik, a plant ecologist at Technische Universität Berlin in Germany.During the five years Löki spent scouring graveyards for the showy, fragrant flowers, he saw a diversity of attitudes toward allowing scientists into cemeteries. In the mountainous north of Azerbaijan, “they were very supportive [of our research] and they said: ‘you do whatever you want,’” Löki recalls. But just a four-hour drive away in southern Azerbaijan, “people over there were very suspicious,” he says. They would approach us immediately, and when we answered their questions they would tell us to leave, he says. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The traditions of different cultures influence whether their cemeteries play host to orchids and other plants. Many religions prohibit building, farming, and resource extraction on burial grounds. But gravesite architecture matters, too. On the Mediterranean coast of Spain and France, orchids grew in just two of the 150 cemeteries surveyed. Rocky soils and local customs dictate that many bodies rest above ground in structures, such as mausoleums, Löki says. These masses of concrete and marble leave very little open soil where plants can grow, he says.Some of the groundskeeping practices at cemeteries may also be more orchid-friendly than others, the researchers believe, although they did not have enough data to statistically test this idea. In some places, plants and animals lived largely undisturbed among the tombstones. Other cemeteries are frequently mowed and treated with pesticides to create a lush, green lawn at the expense of biodiversity, Nagy says.Löki noticed that this kind of manicuring was much more common in Europe than in Turkey, where “they are rather interested in leaving nature alone for religious reasons,” he says. He was fascinated by this fortuitous overlap between spirituality and conservation. The orchids, in any case, are sublime.

      "content": "by Nils Peterson Thesis: There’s the physical you sitting somewhere reading this, breathing the sweet air of the now you are in. Everything else of the you that is you is memory. Well, as we know, memory is a trickster, wily as Coyote in Native American stories. Notebooks help. Here’s a bit from one of mine and some thoughts about it what it all means. a lost world morning bright sun good jazz soprano sax above smoky piano on the record player happy wife gone off to do happy things the world either a flowering of daughters or filled with daughters flowering I eat some less-fat mozzarella tasteless but in a good tasting way drink some spearmint tea too much coffee already and tidy up the house not much but enough nothing to write about today nothing that I want to read quite enough to read enough to sit here resting my hands on the firm regular grain of an oak table while sun pours warm golden honey on my back once in awhile I stir enough to jot something down Well, that world was lost till I picked up an old notebook and found it, the poem (well, maybe just jottings) and the world. We lose a world each day when we go to sleep. No, every hour we lose a hundred – a perfect quantum of a world lasting a micro second until a second quantum pushes it aside. No, not a hundred, not even a million. More. We must lose a galaxy each time we set off in sleep. But each moment sends out a Voyager, a miniature spacecraft carrying artifacts from the Planet Now to a circling earth of the far-off solar system called Then. But memory is a counter-energy, an Enterprise flying from then to now. And then there are notebooks. Some might think of their co-author as a sly Captain Piccard, or, maybe, Coyote. Another way – it’s nice to have memories tucked away in the cupboards of your inner house to pull out so you give the past a shake now and again like looking at a snow-globe in summer and trying to remember what cold felt like. Here’s the next note in the notebook I quoted from above: “I put on Jan Garbarek and the Hilliard Ensemble playing “Parce Mihi Domine” and the smell of incense fills the room. This is not a metaphor. It is what I smell and I need to know why.” Must I believe that I really smelled incense? I think I must, yet I can see Coyote out of the corner of my eye. Maybe another way of thinking about my notebooks – again, The Poetry of the Ordinary. The feet of the young girl running over the grass in the neighborhood park touch the earth lightly, lightly. Her young mother, heavy with her next child, looks at her smiling, and I smile as I walk past in the early evening of a late August. The girl has hardly rump enough to give her shorts purchase. Her mother’s breasts, full and round with the coming of milk, overflow their halter. She sighs as the daughter skips to the fountain, sips, then scurries back with one, two, three cartwheels hurling herself down in a heap of ankles, knees, elbows by her mother’s side. I am some place beneath thinking, a walker and a watcher, drifting in the late summer nowhere to go and going Coda: The notebook is a score of years old. Now, likely, the girl’s grown and gone, along with her not-yet born brother or sister. The mother may be a grandmother. My bad knee makes walking difficult. It is October in this now, and yet, and yet, then is still then and they are still there in my notebook as am I – walking by. Local Habitations Theseus famously says in Midsummer Night’s Dream that the imaginations of the Lunatic, the Lover and the Poet are made of the same stuff. There is truth here. One must be a little mad to face the infinite space of a blank page. One must love the world to want to catch a bit of it, to prevent it from disappearing into the great slough of the past, and one must be madly in love with words to spend hours listening to them sing, hoping they’ll join hands in the dance of a line. He goes on to say that as the poet’s imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name. And so a poem is “a local habitation” of an imagination’s moment. So is a notebook. Yes, well, poems need new readers or old readers rereading to keep from fading away. Old notebooks need – their now older reader. Another memory Books fail. So I look out of the window through a tracery of twig, leaf, and the last berries of autumn at a gray morning sky and think of the negotiations between word and eye. I know I cannot see without words. Earlier, I read that the sense impressions of one-celled animals are not edited for something like a brain, “that only the simplest animals perceive the universe as it is.” I read somewhere else that the invention of glass, something to see through, separates us from the world. So, I live in a house that eye and word have together built out of planks made of guesses about immensity. Coda: Twenty years later I found most of this in a notebook, read it with pleasure finding myself comfortable in this new dwelling looking out of the window into another gray sky. And I see that once again I’ve used the word tracery which I first heard in the spring of 1951 in a short story written by Joan Kennedy for a writing class. I remember loving the word, and now I remember her long, narrow intelligent attractive face and going with her to the Spring Gardenia Dance where we talked much, danced a little. Coyote gives a little, sly bark.",

Simple tips for restoring biodiversity to the land around your home How to start a seed library Help monitor coral reef health without ever putting on a swimsuit “Nature is not optional”: How to restore your yard’s biodiversity When Doug Tallamy bought his 10-acre property in southeastern Pennsylvania in 2000, the former hayfield was covered in invasive plant species. “I’m an entomologist, so I always look for insects, and right away I saw that the insects are not eating these plants,” he recalls. After tackling the non-native species and introducing native plants — though most of them were planted by the animals themselves — the land is now a thriving forest ecosystem. Some 62 species of birds come to the area to breed, and Tallamy has documented 1,360 species of moths to date. “It wasn’t that hard,” says Tallamy, a professor at the department of Entomology and Wildlife Ecology at the University of Delaware. “Nature is resilient. If I can do it, other people can as well.” It takes 6,000 to 9,000 caterpillars to raise one clutch of chickadees to maturity. Credit: Doug Tallamy The experience inspired him to co-found Homegrown National Park, a grassroots conservation initiative helping people regenerate biodiversity on their land by removing invasive plants and adding native ones. Ninety percent of the insects that eat plants can only eat those they co-evolved with, explains Tallamy. “So when you load the environment with a non-native plant it’s essentially removed from the food web.” Few non-native plants are as beloved by Americans as turf grass — lawns cover 40 million acres of land in the U.S., equivalent to the size of Colorado. In addition to using up to nine billion gallons of water daily, they provide next to no value to local biodiversity. But anyone can reintroduce key ecosystem functions to their back yard or front lawn, says Tallamy — and it doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing. “Any way that you can reduce the area of your lawn is a valuable contribution.” Weighed down by negative news? Our smart, bright, weekly newsletter is the uplift you’ve been looking for. [contact-form-7] There are many non-toxic ways to remove turf grass, like solarization using plastic sheets or sheet mulching with cardboard. But despite the rising trend of “meadowscaping,” turning an entire lawn into a meadow is one of the hardest ways to go about restoring biodiversity, says Tallamy. “Starting from seed is very hard unless you have a really blank slate.” In the early days of any restoration project, identifying and removing invasive species is key, so they don’t take valuable resources away from native plants. Those looking to start small can remove parts of their lawn and create islands of native keystone species, balancing a more manicured look with wildlife-friendly areas. This can also pacify unsupportive neighbors or homeowners’ associations, says Tallamy. “Most people don’t know a native plant from a non-native one, but they do know sloppy from neat,” Putting up a sign to explain what you’re doing can also be a good conversation starter. Another effective solution is planting a tree — ideally an oak, depending on location — and creating a pupation site by replacing the lawn underneath with native plants. This does wonders for caterpillars and the birds that depend on them, explains Tallamy, pointing out that it takes 6,000 to 9,000 caterpillars to raise one clutch of chickadees to maturity.

Credit: Doug Tallamy To find the right native keystone plants for these projects, Homegrown National Park provides a number of resources for identifying the right ecoregion and its keystone plants, and connecting with local experts in native planting. Alternatively, connecting with your local extension office is a good first step. “In the past, horticulturists and landscape architects have not thought about what plants do at all. They’ve only thought about what they look like,” says Tallamy. But we can create beautiful landscapes that still retain their ecological functions, he says: “It’s a new challenge — it ought to be fun!” Click here for 10 ways to easily increase the biodiversity on your land. Borrow, grow, return: How one woman started a seed library movement When science teacher Rebecca Newburn decided to start a seed library in her hometown of Richmond, Virginia, she had no experience with the work. After connecting with Seed Savers Exchange and BASIL, the oldest seed lending library in the U.S., she launched the Richmond Grows Seed Lending Library in 2010, making it the seventh such library in the U.S. Seed libraries typically collect locally adapted or heirloom species. Credit: Mike Licht / Flickr Fifteen years later, thanks in no small part to the replicable model pioneered by Newburn, and shared along with detailed resources by the associated Seed Library Network, there are now over 2,600 community-led seed libraries operating in the U.S., where people can “borrow” seeds for their own use and “return” them from their own crop in the next growing cycle. This way, the library can “evolve” along with the local plants and maintain a broader genetic diversity than seeds sold commercially. This, combined with giving gardeners free access to seeds, helps support both plant biodiversity and the wildlife that depends on it for survival. While most are based at public libraries, many are also hosted by farms, community centers, universities and even at private homes. They tend to focus on maintaining a catalogue of locally adapted or heirloom species, combining biodiversity efforts with community education and outreach.

Citizen scientists are diving into marine conservation Coral reefs are the most biologically diverse ecosystem on the planet, hosting a quarter of all marine life despite covering only one percent of the ocean floor. Around the world, citizen scientists are supporting local research and conservation projects by monitoring local reefs and their inhabitants while diving, snorkeling or evaluating data online. Reef Check trains recreational divers around the world to collect standardized scientific data on the health of tropical coral reefs and temperate kelp forests, while Coral Watch, based at the University of Queensland in Australia, developed a freely available Coral Health Chart that lets anyone monitor coral health without prior training and contribute their findings to a global database. Wait, you're not a member yet? Join the Reasons to be Cheerful community by supporting our nonprofit publication and giving what you can. Join Cancel anytime In the U.S., the Rescue a Reef program at the University of Miami hosts field expeditions for scuba-certified volunteers who can help scientists restore local coral populations. Those who want to help protect the Great Barrier Reef don't need to go to Australia or even put on a swimsuit: through Virtual Reef Diver, anyone can help scientists monitor the reef by classifying underwater images from the comfort of their own home.

      "content": "Next week, maybe, there might be a meeting between President Putin and President Trump. Once again, many people are speculating about the end of the war, what it would take for both sides to stop fighting. As it happens, this was the subject of a conversation I had a few weeks ago with a Russian journalist, Konstantin Eggert, who works for Deutsche Welle, Germany's international media company. When I first met him, Konstantin worked for Kommersant, which used to be one of Russia's best newspapers. Now, like so many other Russians I know, he's in exile. The interview was made for DW's Russian-language audience, but it's been posted in English as well. The most important argument is worth repeating, now, before the speculation grows more intense: This is not a war for territory. Putin doesn't need another hundred square kilometers of Donetsk province. His goals are ideological. He wants to to destroy all of Ukraine, to make Ukraine part of a new Russian empire or sphere of influence and to use that victory to undermine NATO and the European Union. As recently as June 20, he said that \"all of Ukraine\" belongs to Russia. Russia's state news agency, RIA Novosti, published two articles on July 30 arguing that \"no one should remain alive in Ukraine\" and \"Ukraine will end very soon.\" Right now, Putin still thinks he can achieve those goals. Until he is convinced otherwise, he will continue fighting. This week, Steve Witkoff, Trump's envoy, was once again in Moscow. No doubt there were discussions about money and energy. Maybe the Russian economy is more precarious than we think, and maybe Putin is looking for a temporary halt to the fighting, although he has never said so in public. Maybe, as some around Trump seem to believe, he can be bribed to stop fighting. But no ceasefire will be permanent until Russia understands that the war was a mistake, a revanchist, imperialist folly, and until Russia understands that Ukraine is a real country, not part of Russia. We still need solidarity, clarity, consistency and the pressure of real sanctions (not random sanctions on India) and continued military support for Ukraine in order to get there. To-Read List: Musk's ghostThe bluster over the supposed Trump-Musk breakup hides a deeper truth: the US government is utterly dependent on Musk's companies. Whatever he says about Trump (and remember, he was the first insider to suggest Trump's name was in the Epstein files) Musk is now so central to so many defense and technology programs that he can't be banished. My colleague Frank Foer writes about this tangled relationship in an excellent article about NASA, which has now been completely superseded by Musk's SpaceX:NASA was born at the height of liberalism's faith in government, and its demise tracks the decline of that faith. As the United States lost confidence in its ability to accomplish great things, it turned to Musk as a potential savior, and ultimately surrendered to him. This isn't an instance of crony capitalism, but a tale about well-meaning administrations, of both parties, pursuing grandiose ambitions without the vision, competence, or funding to realize them.Musk has used that public faith, along with his influence over the federal government and many state and local governments, to contort what were once considered public goods into sources of personal financial gain. Read more here (gift link).NASA isn't the only institution that needs Musk either. Joey Roulette, Cassell Bryan-Low and Tom Balmforth of Reuters have also recently reported a previously unknown story: During Ukraine's critical September 2022 counteroffensive, when the Ukrainian army took back territory in Kharkiv and Kherson provinces, Elon Musk shut down Starlink's internet service in that part of Ukraine. As a result, soldiers could not communicate, drones could not conduct surveillance, artillery could not be guided—leaving Ukrainian service members extremely vulnerable to nearby Russian forces. Musk can alter battlefield outcomes and make life-or-death decisions of a kind that, until recently, only governments had the power to make. Read more here.Finally, in the Nashville Banner, Sarah Grace Taylor reports that Musk's Boring Company has entered a public-private partnership with Tennessee to build a tunnel connecting Nashville's airport to the city's downtown—for the exclusive use of Tesla vehicles. The project was apparently announced without consulting the city government and despite Nashville's geologic challenges (the city's topography is prone to sinkholes and caves). Justin Jones, a Democrat who represents the area in the state legislature, was banned from the press conference. Read more here.

Stay ahead of the curve! P.S.: I usually post these on Sundays, but since the post was ready and GPT-5 was released, I decided to ship it! Enjoy.GPT-5 is here: with the sloppy plots, the major buildup, and subsequent disappointment. It's not the quantum leap it was made out to be, but is another waypoint in the evolution of AI models. But every successive generation seems to grow in size.GPT-2 had about a hundred million parameters in 2019. In just about four years, the parameter count crossed one trillion with GPT-4. GPT-5, whose model architecture is undisclosed, is expected to be in the range of 5-10 trillion parameters — give or take. There are no public numbers to back up these claims.Without a formal background in AI/ML, there is a vague sense that larger is better. So far, this has held true. But, a curious engineering mind poses other questions: What are these parameters? How are they chosen? How come they've gotten so big?In this post, we will answer these questions with a foundational understanding of Transformer architecture used in LLMs, their inner workings, and conclude with a back-of-the-envelope model parameter counting approach that will be able to account for 99% of the parameters used in GPT models, without the rigor of a more formal approach. We'll use the learning to take a stab at the architecture of GPT-5. YMMV.This post is aimed at readers without a background in machine learning concepts.

We will use these estimates to make detailed parameter calculations on GPT4.Speculating on GPT5: We don't know anything about internal model architecture, but we can look at the evolution of GPT models to make educated guesses and estimate the total parameter count.References: A list resources I found useful to learn transformer architecture from the basics.Downloadable Google Sheet you can use to make your own parameter estimates and speculate on GPT-5!Read time: 18-20 minsBirth of the TransformerThe concept of a Transformer was introduced in a revolutionary paper by Google in 2017 called Attention is all you need, which is considered the starting gun for the modern AI race. The problem addressed in the original paper is language translation from English to German, which is a notoriously hard problem due to the way grammar and sentences work. Serialized word-for-word translation does not produce meaningful results, nor is it efficient. For any given word in a sentence, the context of what comes before and after is important. To emulate this awareness, Google researchers introduced the concept of Attention in the context of a neural network (a mathematical imitation of how our brains work) which they referred to as Transformer (only because it sounded cool.)The authors soon realized that the Transformer is capable of much more than translation. It could generate meaningful conversation and generate insights when asked to do so. They also recognized that this approach also applies to audio, images and video, and that the larger this Transformer is made, the better it works. The surprising power of a large language model almost feels like an accident.It scaled beautifully to larger architectures because Attention requires multiplying arrays of numbers called matrices — which, as it turns out, we are really good at doing with computer chips. Today, we are looking at using hundreds of thousands of CPUs and GPUs to make chips think and do our jobs for us.But the process begins with converting human language to the world of numbers, so that we can use chips to perform calculations that allow silicon to think at extraordinary scale. We'll look at how this works next.Tokens, Embeddings, and VocabularySince computers work well with numbers, a sentence is first broken up and encoded into in floating point numbers — which is computer-speak for a number with several decimal places. A sentence could be separated according to words, syllables, punctuations or spaces, and each piece is called a token. Similar representations are possible for images, text or video.Once the input is broken up into tokens, it must be converted to an array of numbers called a vector using the process of embedding. How big this array of numbers or vector is (a quantity labeled dk), depends on the choice of transformer architecture.Embedding is the process of converting a token into an array of numbers.For example, Deepseek R1 full model uses an embedding size of 7,168 floating point numbers. Smaller variants of this model could use lower sizes. GPT-4 likely uses close to 16,000 numbers. The choice of size is critical: too small and it fails to capture intricate relationships between words; too large, and memory requirements explode. The collection of all possible embeddings (think of it as the number form of words) represents the total dictionary of words that the LLM understands, and is referred to as the vocabulary of the model. Deepseek R1 has a total vocabulary size of 129,280 tokens. The total embedding table size is product of token embedding size and vocabulary length. Here it is 7,168 × 129,280 floating point numbers. This large array of numbers is essentially the \"Oxford Dictionary of English\" that an LLM will use.Each row in the embedding table is a token. The collection of all tokens is called the model vocabulary.The table below shows the token embeddings for the sentence \"HTML coders are not considered programmers.\"Token embeddings for \"HTML coders are not considered programmers\" using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model. Source: Huggingface.co.Each floating point number in an embedding can be represented at different levels of precision: Higher precision like float32 (FP32) uses 4 bytes.Half precision formats like float16 (FP16) uses 2 bytes. Low precision formats like int8 uses 1 byte.Higher precision is excellent for training the model, but comes at high memory cost. Lower precision is good for memory savings, and useful for fast inference (a term for using the trained model to generate outputs.) The choice of precision is important to ensure that the LLM will run on the available hardware.Subscribe nowQKV, Context Window, and Batch SizesOnce a token has been embedded into numeric vector format, three unique quantities called Query, Key and Value are then calculated for each embedding, say X. These new vectors (Q, K, V) are essential for computing Attention, and are obtained from the matrix multiplication below.Broadly speaking, we can assign meaning to these quantities as below:Query (Q): This vector is the equivalent of asking - \"Which of the tokens in the sequence are relevant to my input token X (say diet)?\"Key (K): This vector is the response to the query identifying the indices of the tokens that are relevant — \"Tokens 124, 908, and 1,423 are relevant.\"Value (V): This vector provides the content of each of those tokens — \"Token 124 says cow, Token 908 says grass, Token 1,423 says eat.\"The picture above shows the Q, K, V vectors for one token X. In practice, many tokens are taken together and processed at once. We will discuss exactly how.Every row in the matrix X corresponds to a single token embedding like a word. The number of rows depends on how many tokens are taken together — a metric called sequence length or context window. For example, Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro uses 1 million tokens in its context window during inference, which corresponds to 1 million row entries in the matrix X. Assuming an embedding vector length of 3,092 and 1 million rows, X is a 2D matrix of size 3,092 × 1 million.When many tokens are taken together in a context window, the input matrix X is 2D with a size of \"dk × context window\".Context window helps the model remember what was presented to it 1 million tokens ago, which means it can draw meaning between a lot of tokens. This is critical when you give an LLM a whole book and ask for a summary, or require it to remember long conversations. Such long context windows are good for inference, but not for training.To speed up the process of training, models process multiple sequences simultaneously in batch sizes anywhere between tens to hundreds. Context windows used for model training will be considerably shorter — like 8,000 to 32,000 tokens — to keep the memory requirements during training in check.As an example: assuming a batch size of 100, sequence length of 10,000 tokens, and token vector length of 3,092, X becomes a 3D matrix of size 3,092 × 10,000 × 100, or about 3 billion floating point numbers. Using larger batch sizes speeds up the training process, which smaller batches are computationally more feasible. This Pareto frontier explains the trade-off nicely.Source: An Empirical Model of Large-Batch Training, OpenAI (arXiv)The matrices WQ, WK and WV are called weight matrices and are obtained from the training process using a method of back-propagation which we won't get into here. Their sizes are based on the embedding vector length, dk. For example, with a 4,096 element long vector like the one used in the GPT3-6.7B model, the weight matrices are of size [4,096 × 4,096]. The means that the Q, K, V matrices calculated from the matrix multiplication equation shown above will also be 4,096 elements long per token, which will expand along three dimensions when context window and batch size is taken into account.Scaled Dot-Product AttentionWith Q, K, V matrices available, the important quantity called Attention as proposed by Google researchers can be calculated using the following function.Let's understand this equation better by looking at its components.Query × Key (Transposed): This is the dot product of the query and key matrices, which requires taking a transpose of the matrix for the math to work. The resulting vector has many numbers, each of which gives you a measure for how well what you asked (query) aligns with what is in the tokens (key). A high value at any point in the vector means there is a lot of relevance; a low value means there is little relevance.√dk: dk is the length of the token embedding which could be 4,096 like in GPT3-6.7B. The dot product is divided by the square root of this embedding to scale the dot product values down to smaller numbers.softmax: This is a mathematical function that converts any vector of length L into a probability of L possible outcomes. After applying the softmax function, the values in the scaled dot-product have probability values between 0 and 1.Dot-product with V: By computing the dot product of the probabilities of token relevance with the token value vector, you get the probabilities of how relevant each token in the context window is to the original query. Scaled dot-product attention computed using Q, K, V vectors when the input token X asks for the relevance of \"diet\" in the context window.We have now computed Attention, and based on how we took the dot product and scaled it, this method is called scaled dot-product attention. From our earlier example, words like cow, grass, and eat will have a high relevance to diet, but a word like chair will not. This also underlines the important of large context windows in making intelligence connections between words; a large context window will find more relevance to tokens and draw meaning from them.Multi-Headed AttentionA better way to capture complex relationships between tokens and improve performance of LLMs is to use multi-headed attention. This is the attention calculation approach adopted by most LLMs today. The step-by-step process looks like this:Compute Q, K, V matrices from the input embedding X like before.Logically break up these matrices into multiple smaller matrices called heads, and calculate attention on each head.Reconstruct the large attention matrix by joining together attention from each head.For example, Q, K, V matrices of size 2,048 can be broken up into 16 heads. This means that size of vectors in each head is 2,048/16 = 128 floating point numbers. The same process of scaled dot product attention described earlier is applied to each of the 16 heads. The attention from each head is then collected at the output to form multi-headed attention. More specifically, it is multiplied by another weight matrix WO before getting the final attention Z. The picture below shows this process for four heads.By sharing this post with just two other friends using the button below, unlock 1-month of paid subscriber benefits! ShareDecoder Transformer ArchitectureWith what we've learned so far, we can now discuss the decoder-only architecture, which is used by OpenAI models such as ChatGPT-4. The decoder is a fundamental building block of a transformer, and has three components.Attention (which we have already discussed)Feedforward network (FFN)Normalizations and residual connectionsA multi-layer Transformer is built by stacking several decoders. The input to the first decoder is word embeddings — the translation of tokens into numbers, but every subsequent decoder gets the output of the previous decoder as input. The figure below shows a transformer with 6 layers of decoders.Decoder-only transformer architecture.Feedforward NetworkThe feedforward network or FFN (sometimes called the multi-level perceptron or MLP) is a two-layer neural network. It is called feedforward because information only moves from input to output, and never backwards.If you're not familiar with the idea of a neural network, it is the mathematical representation of the complex structure of a biological brain.There are neurons represented by little circles in the complex mesh of connections inside the FFN. Each connection is the equivalent of a synapse between any two neurons, represented by a mathematical function called the activation function. The activation function has several constant parameters associated with it, and these are called weights of the FFN which are usually obtained from the LLM training process.The illustration shows orange circles as the input/output neurons and the blue circles as hidden-layer neurons. This network is called a two-layer FFN because there are two layers of weights — one from input to hidden layer, and another from hidden layer to output. The choice of the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the FFN is an important architectural choice in the design of Transformer-based LLMs.Normalization and Residual ConnectionsThese steps are present to maintain a stable numerical environment during the calculation process. As numbers pass through the decoder, they may explode into large numbers unless constrained by the process of repeated normalization at each step. This is a key requirement to getting transformers to work, without which it becomes extremely difficult to scale to larger networks. Residual connections involves adding the input to the output so that the gradients (how fast numbers change) are kept under control in the training process. We'll leave it at that level of detail for now.After the paywall, we will use these concepts to calculate the number of parameters in popular LLMs. Specifically, we will cover:Parameter counting using Google's BERT-Base. We will go through step-by-step and count all the 110 million parameters in the weight matrices used in this early LLM. We will provide a generic formula that is applicable to most model architectures like ChatGPT.Detailed look at GPT2/GPT3: Using published model architecture for early OpenAI models, we will calculate and verify the number of parameters used in GPT2 and GPT3 models.An educated guess at GPT4: While OpenAI did not openly publish model weights for GPT4, several industry experts have guess its model architecture. We will use these estimates to make detailed calculations on GPT4.Speculating on GPT5: There is plenty of online hype about GPT5 and how it is going to be game-changing. We will take a conservative look at the probable model architecture for GPT5 and estimate the total parameter count.References: A list of useful references to learn transformer architecture from the basics.Paid subscribers also get a downloadable Google Sheet you can use to make your own parameter estimates and speculate on GPT-5!

      "content": "I have a new article up at Human Progress on the importance of high-skill immigration. In the article, I discuss the MAGA alliance between technofuturists and nationalists. People within the Trump coalition act as if these groups have a great deal in common, and in areas like crime and DEI, that is true. But I think there's a tendency for the pro-progress side to refuse to see how important high-skill immigration is for creating the kind of world that they want. Among the more intellectual supporters of the 2024 Trump campaign, there was a message that stressed technological progress and a positive outlook toward the future. The American venture capitalist Marc Andreessen's \"Techno-Optimist Manifesto\" became a touchstone for this group, celebrating the virtues of innovation, abundance, and human agency. Rather than focus solely on grievances or cultural retrenchment, these advocates of progress framed the Trump agenda as a rejection of stagnation and an embrace of the future. They argued that the true enemies of progress were the left-leaning bureaucracies, academic institutions, and regulatory regimes that, in their view, had become hostile to risk-taking and entrepreneurship.Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel's famous maxim that \"we were promised flying cars, instead we got 140 characters\" has become a rallying cry among the tech right. Vice President JD Vance, in a high‑profile speech at the AI Action Summit in Paris, struck many of the same notes, warning against overregulation in the name of safety and stressing that we should expect future developments to make workers more productive rather than put them out of jobs.The tech right is of course correct not to fear the future and to see technology as the key to human progress, not a threat to it. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has taken us backward on what is arguably the most important issue from an enhanced-growth perspective: openness toward high-skilled immigration.Human capital—the skills, knowledge, and health of workers—is increasingly the engine of productivity growth, far more so than natural resources or physical inputs. In his 2008 book Triumph of the City, Harvard economist Edward Glaeser shows how American cities have risen or fallen over the past several decades according to their ability to serve as places where smart and talented people can cluster together. Our great industries are built on conglomerations of talent in different locales: tech in Boston and San Francisco; finance in New York City; entertainment in Los Angeles. College towns throughout the country play a similar role on a smaller scale.And since only a minority of the talent in the world belongs to people born in the United States, immigration is necessary to make sure that the most productive workers can cluster together. According to the Indian American venture capitalist Deedy Das, of the 44 members of Meta's recently recruited superintelligence team, who can earn packages of up to $100 million a year, half are from China and 75 percent are first-generation immigrants. As of 2024, 46 percent of Fortune 500 companies were launched by first-generation immigrants (108) or their children (123). A 2022 study by the National Foundation for American Policy showed that this same group had founded or cofounded more than half of the US start-up companies valued at $1 billion or more.Read the whole thing here.Human capital is the key variable determining whether nations succeed or fail. We live in a country that has historically attracted the smartest and most ambitious people in the world, and that is fundamentally more important than things like natural resource endowment or even tax policy, except to the extent that issues like the latter indirectly affect who decides to come here. We can compare the debate over high-skill immigration with that over DEI by seeing what the world would look like if either side got what it wanted. Take university admissions to top graduate programs in STEM, which are responsible for much of our basic research.Wokes would like equal racial representation. So if their maximum goals were accomplished, blacks and Hispanics would be around 25%-30% of scientists, leaving maybe 75% of slots to be determined by merit. You have to also factor out the number of underrepresented minorities who get positions even without the benefits of affirmation action, which is certainly higher than zero. Now imagine a nationalist who wants US companies, labs, and universities to prefer their own citizens. Americans are 4% of the world population. Now, talent is not evenly distributed across the globe, and Americans have certain advantages going for them in any competition, like being from a rich country and already speaking English. If we're being really generous, we might say that in a purely meritocratic system, about 30% of elite scientists will be Americans.All of this means that while the DEI advocate must only redistribute a minority of slots to less deserving applicants, the logic of citizen preferences leads to a much more unbalanced outcome.Asian intelligence combined with American values. At MIT, 40% of graduate students are foreign born. Caltech is even higher, at 47%. The fact that Americans are 4% of the global population and still a majority of these schools is interesting, and likely results in part from US citizenship requirements for some sensitive fields and barriers stopping students coming from abroad.Nativism, then, has much more potential to damage American science than DEI ever could. Of course neither wokes nor nativists can ever expect to get everything that they want, and instead of asking who would be more damaging if they had absolute power, we may approach the question from the perspective of who is likely to do more damage at the margins. I think this comparison still makes restrictionists look worse, given how much foreign talent exists abroad, and how much power the executive branch has on the immigration issue. We've already seen a major crackdown on Chinese students based on national security grounds, which we can assume is mostly pretextual given this administration's tendency to look for any excuses it can find to keep foreigners out of the country. If your perspective is zero-sum, all you might care about is that in college admissions Americans get the most opportunities. But this is a terrible lens through which to understand public policy issues. From the perspective of stimulating growth and having a more innovative economy, the case for high-skill immigration becomes even stronger. The economic based restrictionist arguments are pure lump of labor fallacy. You don't \"help\" Americans or any other group of people by hindering scientific and technological progress. Many will say it's good to let in the world's geniuses, but that we don't need people who are simply slightly above average. Of course, there's no reliable way for government to decide who the geniuses are beforehand. Under such a system, Elon Musk wouldn't have gotten in, and neither would Jensen Huang's parents. The point is that if you accept large amounts of people who are slightly above average, some percentage of them and their children will turn out to make absolutely massive contributions to society.What about those who don't? Well, those migrants will simply improve national IQ and contribute to the country in more mundane ways, helping create a safer nation and higher living standards. God forbid! And if you think they're going to shift the politics of the country in a negative direction, that is a ridiculously speculative argument. You don't forgo benefits that are guaranteed, massive and immediate because you're afraid of costs that are uncertain and far off into the future anyway, giving you a great deal of time to deal with them. And these arguments are becoming more and more difficult to take seriously with the turn away from markets on the right, and JD Vance's emergence as Trump successor, given his hostility to trade and affinity towards Lina Khan and labor unions. I'm old enough to remember when nativists complained that immigration would make the country more socialist, yet as the Republican Party has become more nativist and anti-market at the same time, they have shown themselves to be accommodating towards or even enthusiastic about economic statism as long as it's the type preferred by Americans who share their distaste for foreigners. It is also interesting that just as IQ discourse has become mainstreamed on the right, so has restrictionism targeting both high-skill and low-skill immigration. Taking the impact of IQ seriously means you should be absolutely paranoid about the possibility that American society will lock out the people most likely to contribute to human progress. Is there any good argument against high-skill immigration? Not one that I can see that can be made by anyone who is intelligent, honest, and doesn't prioritize their prejudices over the well being of their country and humanity. If regular Americans don't like the idea of elites who don't look like them, I think they'll get over it when Elite Human Capital cures their diabetes, baldness, and erectile dysfunction.There are people who would rather see their grandmother waste away from Alzheimer's than have to look at more brown faces. If they rarely admit that this is the tradeoff we face, it is due to motivated reasoning. There is no coherent way to accept the reality of IQ and the importance of market forces, and also not be an enthusiastic champion of unlimited high-skill immigration. Thanks for reading.

      "content": "OpenAI GPT-5 is out. I didn't get the embargo because I'm a bit hard on OpenAI at times (which I think is good), but I've read all the early reviews: from Ethan Mollick, Tyler Cowen, Every, Latent Space, METR, Artificial Analysis, and a couple of others. I've watched the 1-hour-long demo, read the four blog posts that OpenAI put out, and the model's system card PDF.I can summarize GPT-5's main improvements in one paragraph: It's cheap, fast at times, and available to all (most people think GPT-4o is state-of-the-art!); it's better across benchmarks, dominating the price-performance Pareto frontier (some think the upgrade is underwhelming, though, especially compared to Anthropic's Claude 4/4.1 models); it simplifies the product offering by internally selecting models for you (at its whim); it has superior tool-use skills which entails better agentic behavior (including research); it's the best model in the world at coding (that's key to help OpenAI devs build GPT-6 sooner); it still fails ARC-AGI 2; and still sucks at creative writing.That's it. It's what you get from checking the sources I checked (which is, all of them). However, there's one more thing that no one emphasized—which is also a win for OpenAI—and this one thing is what I consider the most important improvement GPT-5 brings: a huge reduction in hallucination and deception rates.Earlier this week, I put out a mildly damning post on GPT-5 to heat up the pre-release days. I titled it \"GPT-5: OpenAI's Flagship Model Faces Great Expectations.\" After one long section contextualizing the announcement—GPT-4.5 was a commercial failure but not a technical one; the scaling laws are yielding diminishing returns but not stopping; and OpenAI is not falling behind as revenue and growth soar—I exposed my thesis: AI labs are too focused on raising the ceiling of capabilities (e.g., superhuman smarts, PhD-level knowledge, agentic behavior) and too little focused on raising the floor of capabilities (e.g., please, don't fail this puzzle for kids; please, don't lie to me; please, don't invent information and then bury the cues until I've lost hours of work; and please, pretty please—don't glaze every question I ask as the best question ever asked since the dawn of humanity).I argued AI labs do this because 1) they expect that raising the ceiling will raise the floor, and 2) they don't know how to do it themselves. AI is too weird, I wrote, and that makes it hard to fill the seemingly easy-to-fill gaps. More importantly, I argued that many users are indifferent to gains from model-to-model updates because they only care about the floor rising. In one sentence: no one gives a fuck how smart AI is if it's constantly making up stuff. And I pledged: I'd pay twice the price to get the hallucination rate to zero. Well, friends, somehow, OpenAI has delivered.Hallucinations are not at 0% just yet—and they may never get there—but you'll be glad to learn that the rate at which GPT-5 hallucinates is 26% smaller than GPT-4o (11.6% vs 20.6%) and 65% smaller than o3 when thinking (4.8% vs 22%) for typical chats (the rate is even smaller for \"complex, open-ended, fact-seeking prompts,\" like those in LongFact and FActScore evals, below 1% in some cases). Here are the graphs (they're in the blog post but the information is more complete in the system card):Same thing for the deception rates (e.g., saying it can do something it can't): In standard ChatGPT conversations, it has gone down from 4.8% (o3) to 2.1% (GPT-5):I find it fascinating that the one release I consider a victory (insofar as these results are faithfully reflected in the daily use of 700 million people), the AI community thinks is disappointing. My entire Twitter feed is calling out mistakes in the graphs (can happen to anyone, but come on: during the most important product release of the year!), and extending their AGI timelines (I guess they really, really believed we were getting AGI next year or something).My overall reading is short and sweet (I may have more to report once I've tested it in depth, but I don't think so; in any case I may do an \"implications\" post, which I know you love): Raising the floor of AI capabilities—less making stuff up and fewer lies—is always a good thing. Also, I'm happy it does suck at writing (said the writer). I'm happy that I got it right when I wrote two days ago that it would be received with \"unfair disappointment.\" And, finally, I'm happy that people are starting to realize AGI won't be that easy a target to achieve. With that, make sure to try it and see for yourself; you should have it available in your ChatGPT app. Over and out!",

      "content": "Sometimes the market provides perfect teaching moments. On August 6, 2025, Blackstone Secured Lending Fund delivered one when it marked down its largest holding—a private credit loan to Thoma Bravo-backed software company Medallia Inc.—to approximately 87 cents on the dollar.This single position represented 5.37% of the fund's net assets, totaling more than $380 million at par but now valued at around $338 million—a $42 million hit from one loan. The markdown represents a continued decline from 94 cents two quarters ago to 89 cents last quarter.\"The company is underperforming our expectations and the mark reflects that,\" Brad Marshall, Blackstone's global head of private credit strategies, explained during the earnings call, responding to an analyst who characterized the markdown as evidence of \"some degree of stress.\"The Fundamental Problem with ConcentrationThis situation illustrates why diversification matters more in credit than almost any other asset class. Unlike equity investing, where concentrated positions might generate alpha, credit is fundamentally about avoiding losses rather than hitting home runs. When you're lending money, your upside is capped at getting paid back with interest—but your downside is 100% of your investment.Given market efficiency, smart investors focus on capturing broad, diversified exposure to minimize idiosyncratic risk—the kind of company-specific or manager-specific risk that doesn't compensate you for taking. The goal should be capturing the \"beta\" of the private credit asset class, earning appropriate compensation for credit and illiquidity risks.Unlike equity markets where market-cap weighting theoretically provides efficiency, credit risk resembles a put option sold by the lender. This makes diversification not just helpful, but essential for optimal portfolio construction.A Better Way: Maximum Diversification in PracticeIn my June 11, 2025 Substack column, I highlighted why Cliffwater's CCLFX represented my preferred approach to private credit allocation. The fund's diversification profile demonstrates what proper risk management looks like in this space.As of June 30, 2025, CCLFX's $29.7 billion in assets under management were spread across more than 3,900 loans with minimal concentration:Largest single exposure: Just 0.6% of net assets.Blackstone's largest exposure: 5.37% of net assets—roughly 9 times larger.This isn't just better than Blackstone; CCLFX's 0.6% maximum exposure is half the 1.2% average for the CDLI Index and just 11% of the 5.5% average of the largest 25 BDC lenders, with some funds showing concentration multiples far higher than this average. The fund maintains superior diversification across the top 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 holdings compared to peers, and is even more diversified than its benchmark, the CDLI Index.Beyond Single-Name DiversificationWhile Blackstone's Medallia markdown provides a clear lesson about avoiding concentration, effective private credit investing requires diversification across multiple dimensions:Industry and Sector Diversification: Avoiding overexposure to any single economic sector or industry group that might face systematic challenges.Lender Diversification: Spreading risk across multiple direct lending relationships rather than concentrating with a few large players.Seniority Structure: Maintaining appropriate exposure to first-lien positions versus more subordinated debt.Loan-to-Value Ratios: Understanding and managing the underlying collateral coverage across the portfolio.Sponsor Quality: Ensuring loans are backed by private equity sponsors with proven track records of successful portfolio company management.Leverage Management: Keeping fund-level leverage minimal—ideally no more than necessary to cover operating expenses.Liquidity Management: Maintaining appropriate liquidity buffers for redemptions and new opportunities.The Real Cost of Chasing Yield Through ConcentrationBlackstone's experience with Medallia provides a timely reminder that in credit investing, what looks like higher returns through concentration often simply reflects uncompensated risk-taking. When that single 5.37% position moves against you—as it inevitably will in some cases—the impact on overall fund performance can be substantial.While management fees and expense ratios matter, they shouldn't be the primary criteria for selecting private credit exposure. A slightly higher fee for significantly better diversification and risk management often represents superior value for investors.The Bottom LinePrivate credit can provide attractive risk-adjusted returns and portfolio diversification benefits, but only when approached with appropriate risk management. Blackstone's $42 million lesson from a single loan serves as a powerful reminder that in credit investing, it's not about hitting home runs—it's about consistently getting on base while avoiding strikeouts.For investors seeking private credit exposure, prioritize maximum diversification over concentration, comprehensive risk management over yield chasing, and proven operational excellence over marketing promises. Your portfolio will thank you when the next Medallia situation inevitably arises.Larry Swedroe is the author or co-author of 18 books on investing, including his latest Enrich Your Future.

      "content": "NewsNation's Chris Cuomo wants you to know he's a serious journalist. He's a former CNN anchor, which makes it extra special that he just fell for a laughably bad AI-generated video of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling Sydney Sweeney's jeans ad \"Nazi propaganda.\"The fake AOC in the video, which Cuomo apparently watched and thought \"yes, this seems real,\" says things like \"watching that sultry little temptress squeeze into a Canadian tuxedo\" and talks about Sweeney's \"bouncy little funbags.\" At one point, the AI version of the congresswoman claims that \"skinny, attractive, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, cisgender women descend from the slave-daddy oppressors of this nation.\"And Chris Cuomo, professional news man, looked at this and thought: this is extremely real.\"Nothing about Hamas or people burning jews cars...but Sweeney jeans ad?\" he posted on X. \"Deserved time on floor of congress? What happened to this party?\"The video had a watermark. It literally said \"parody 100% made with AI.\" The account that posted it was called MemeRunnerGPT, and the Instagram post included \"ChatGPT + AI Art\" in the description. Come on, Chris.AOC's response: \"This is a deepfake dude. Please use your critical thinking skills. At this point you're just reposting Facebook memes and calling it journalism.\"After deleting his post (which stayed up for hours, by the way), Cuomo offered this masterpiece of an apology: \"You are correct...that was a deepfake (but it really does sound like you). Thank you for correcting. But now to the central claim: show me you calling on hamas to surrender or addressing the bombing of a car in st louis belonging to the idf american soldier?...dude?\"On his NewsNation show, Cuomo sort of admitted his mistake, saying, \"They got me. AI. It was really good, and it did seem like something she would say, but it wasn't her.\" Then he spent the rest of the segment attacking AOC for not condemning Hamas enough, because when you've been pantsed by a chatbot, the mature response is definitely to double down on your political grievances.The thing is, even if you knew absolutely nothing about AI or deepfakes, the content itself should've been the giveaway. Since when does AOC talk about anyone's \"bouncy little funbags\" on the House floor? When has any member of Congress used the phrase \"sultry little temptress\" in an official capacity? But Cuomo's desire to own the libs was apparently so overwhelming that his brain just shut off completely.Chris Cuomo. Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images for Tribeca FestivalThe Present Age is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.Here's what makes Cuomo's faceplant even more ridiculous. That Sydney Sweeney jeans ad controversy he was so eager to weaponize? That was mostly fake, absolutely manufactured, too. I wrote about this last week. Check that out.So Cuomo didn't just fall for fake content. He fell for fake content about a fake controversy. Layers upon layers of unreality, like a nesting doll made of bullshit.Charlie Warzel at The Atlantic nailed this whole phenomenon. Nobody's actually talking to each other anymore. Everyone's just making statements that become fodder for someone else's statement. It's not discourse, it's just people shouting past each other for engagement.Cuomo wanted to believe it. He needed AOC to be wasting congressional time commenting on Sydney Sweeney or whatever. He needed the Democrats to be the crazy ones obsessing over a jeans ad instead of serious issues. His confirmation bias was so strong it overrode the part of his brain that should've noticed all the red flags signaling that the video was fake.American Eagle's stock went up 24% through all this, by the way. They got exactly what they wanted. And they didn't even have to orchestrate the controversy. The outrage machine has gotten so efficient it's started generating its own fuel. Completely self-sustaining. ShareNo, it doesn't it say something about society that it could be realAfter getting called out, Cuomo did what every person who falls for obvious fake content does. He made it worse.\"You are correct...that was a deepfake (but it really does sound like you),\" he wrote in response to AOC.This is exactly what Christina Pushaw did back in 2022 when she shared a fake Washington Post article about a homophobic dog. She posted a screenshot of a completely fabricated story claiming Taylor Lorenz wrote about Whitney Chewston, a dachshund who'd become a meme. When people pointed out the article didn't exist, her defenders rushed in with the classic: Well, doesn't it say something about the media that this was believable?Like then, I will again say that no, it does not say something about society or the media or whatever that it could be real.Joe Rogan does this constantly. He'll invent a story, get mad about it, find out it's fake, then somehow still be mad because the fact he could imagine it means something profound. There's literally a webcomic about this exact phenomenon because it happens so often. Person believes fake thing, gets corrected, insists their gullibility is actually society's fault.The \"but it really does sound like you\" might be the most telling part. No, Chris, it doesn't sound like her. But in Cuomo's mind, this insane parody was indistinguishable from reality because his brain's been marinating in Twitter so long that he genuinely can't tell the difference anymore.Leave a commentJournalists have to do betterWe've got a problem when the people who are supposed to be checking facts can't spot fakes that literally announce themselves.And it's only getting worse. The AI that fooled Cuomo had obvious tells. Bad lip-syncing, ridiculous dialogue, a giant watermark. But the tech's improving every day. Soon the fakes won't announce themselves. They'll be perfect recreations of real people saying plausible things that never happened.What then? If Cuomo can't spot a fake that's practically waving a flag saying \"I'M FAKE,\" how's he going to handle the sophisticated stuff? How's any journalist who prioritizes partisan point-scoring over basic verification?The answer is they won't. They'll share whatever makes them feel vindicated, whatever confirms their priors, whatever gets engagement. And when they get caught, they'll blame society, or Democrats, or the concept of objective truth itself. Anything but themselves.",

Earlier this week, Tesla granted him $29 billion in stock after his previous compensation package was rejected by a judge. The package is meant to retain Musk as Tesla's chief executive and keep \"Elon's energies focused on Tesla.\" On the DOGE front, the requirement that government employees send in weekly emails about five things they've accomplished (started by Musk while he was at DOGE) is being wound down. And this week, DOGE staffer Edward Coristine (AKA Big Balls) was beaten in an attempted carjacking. Responding to the attack, Donald Trump said that \"If D.C. doesn't get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City.\"And on the favorability front, 32.3 percent of Americans view Musk favorably and 57.0 percent view him unfavorably. That's a net favorability rating of -24.7, which isn't much of a change from where Musk's favorability has been for the past few weeks. -EMD, 8/06/25See also: Donald Trump approval rating dashboard.Subscribe nowElon Musk was once fairly popular. But his numbers have inverted as his support for President Trump has increased and particularly since he became a \"special government employee\" and the de facto head of DOGE. Although Musk may eventually leave the government, he'll remain an exceptionally important and controversial public figure even if he does. Until then, he could be a liability for Trump because he's less popular than the president is even as Trump's numbers have also declined.

      "content": "Hello all, Well, here's to another relentless week of (mostly bad) AI news. Between the AI bubble discourse—my contribution, a short blog on the implications of an economy propped up by AI, is doing numbers, as they say—and the AI-generated mass shooting victim discourse, I've barely had time to get into OpenAI. The ballooning startup has released its highly anticipated GPT-5 model, as well as its first actually \"open\" model in years, and is considering a share sale that would value it at $500 billion. And then there's the New York Times' whole package of stories on Silicon Valley's new AI-fueled 'Hard Tech' era. That package includes a Mike Isaac piece on the vibe shift in the Bay Area, from the playful-presenting vibes of the Googles and Facebooks of yesteryear, to the survival-of-the-fittest, increasingly right-wing-coded vibes of the AI era, and a Kate Conger report on what that shift has meant for tech workers. A third, by Cade Metz, about \"the Rise of Silicon Valley's Techno-Religion,\" was focused largely on the rationalist, effective altruist, and AI doomer movement rising in the Bay, and whose base is a compound in Berkeley called Lighthaven. The piece's money quote is from Greg M. Epstein, a Harvard chaplain and author of a book about the rise of tech as a new religion. \"What do cultish and fundamentalist religions often do?\" he said. \"They get people to ignore their common sense about problems in the here and now in order to focus their attention on some fantastical future.\"Screenshot of the New York Times' feature by Cade Metz.All this reminded me that not only had I been to the apparently secret grounds of Lighthaven (the Times was denied entry), late last year, where I was invited to attend a closed door meeting of AI researchers, rationalists, doomers, and accelerationists, but I had written an account of the whole affair and left it unpublished. It was during the holidays, I'd never satisfactorily polished the piece, and I wasn't doing the newsletter regularly yet, so I just kind of forgot about it. I regret this! I reread the blog and think there's some worthwhile, even illuminating stuff about this influential scene at the heart of the AI industry, and how it works. So, I figure better late than never, and might as well publish now. The event was called \"The Curve\" and it took place November 22-24th, 2024, so all commentary should be placed in the context of that timeline. I've given the thing a light edit, but mostly left it as I wrote it late last year, so some things will surely be dated. Finally, the requisite note that work like this is now made entirely possible by my subscribers, and especially those paid supporters who chip in $6 a month to make this writing (and editing!) happen. If you're an avid reader, and you're able, consider helping to keep the Blood flowing here. Alright, enough of that. Onwards. Subscribe nowA couple weeks ago, I traveled to Berkeley, CA, to attend the Curve, an invite-only \"AI disagreements\" conference, per its billing. The event was held at Lighthaven, a meeting place for rationalists and effective altruists (EAs), and, according to a report in the Guardian, allegedly purchased with the help of a seven-figure gift from Sam Bankman-Fried. As I stood in the lobby, waiting to check in, I eyed a stack of books on a table by the door, whose title read Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality. These are the 660,000-word, multi-volume works of fan fiction written by rationalist Eliezer Yudkowsky, who is famous for his assertion that tech companies are on the cusp of building an AI that will exterminate all human life on this planet.The AI disagreements encountered at the Curve were largely over that very issue—when, exactly, not if, a super-powerful artificial intelligence was going to arise, and how quickly it would wipe out humanity when it did so. I've been to my share of AI conferences by now, and I attended this one because I thought it might be useful to hear this widely influential perspective articulated directly by those who believe it, and because there were top AI researchers and executives from leading companies like Anthropic in attendance, and I'd be able to speak with them one on one. I told myself I'd go in with an open mind, do my best to check my priors at the door, right next to the Harry Potter fan fiction. I mingled with the EA philosophers and the AI researchers and doomers and tech executives. Told there would be accommodations onsite, I arrived to discover that, my having failed to make a reservation in advance, meant either sleeping in a pod or shared dorm-style bedding. Not quite sure I could handle the claustrophobia of a pod, I opted for the dorms. I bunked next to a quiet AI developer who I barely saw the entire weekend and a serious but polite employee of the RAND corporation. The grounds were surprisingly expansive; there were couches and fire pits and winding walkways and decks, all full of people excitedly talking in low voices about artificial general intelligence (AGI) or super intelligence (ASI) and their waning hopes for alignment—that such powerful computer systems would act in concert with the interests of humanity.I did learn a great deal, and there was much that was eye-opening. For one thing, I saw the extent to which some people really, truly, and deeply believe that the AI models like those being developed by OpenAI and Anthropic are just years away from destroying the human race. I had often wondered how much of this concern was performative, a useful narrative for generating meaning at work or spinning up hype about a commercial product—and there are clearly many operators in Silicon Valley, even attendees at this very conference, who are sharply aware of this particular utility, and able to harness it for that end. But there was ample evidence of true belief, even mania, that is not easily feigned. There was one session where people sat in a circle, mourning the coming loss of humanity, in which tears were shed. The first panel I attended was headed up by Yudkowsky, perhaps the movements' leading AI doomer, to use the popular shorthand, which some rationalists onsite seemed to embrace and others rejected. In a packed, standing-room only talk, the man outlined the coming AI apocalypse, and his proposed plan to stop it—basically, a unilateral treaty enforced by the US and China and other world powers to prevent any nation from developing more advanced AI than what is more or less currently commercially available. If nations were to violate this treaty, then military force could be used to destroy their data centers. The conference talks were held under Chatham House Rule, so I won't quote Yudkowsky directly, but suffice to say his viewpoint boils down to what he articulated in a TIME op-ed last year: \"If somebody builds a too-powerful AI, under present conditions, I expect that every single member of the human species and all biological life on Earth dies shortly thereafter.\" At one point in his talk, at the prompting of a question I had sent into the queue, the speaker asked everyone in the room to raise their hand to indicate whether or not they believed AI was on the brink of destroying humanity—about half the room believed on our current path, destruction was imminent. Attendees posted their predicted AGI scenarios on whiteboards inside the compound.This was no fluke. In the next three talks I attended, some variation of \"well by then we're already dead\" or \"then everyone dies\" was uttered by at least one of the speakers. In one panel, a debate between a former OpenAI employee, Daniel Kokotajlo, and Sayash Kapoor, a computer scientist who'd written a book casting doubt on some of these claims, the audience, and the OpenAI employee, seemed outright incredulous that Kapoor did not think AGI posed an immediate threat to society. When the talk was over, the crowd flocked around Kokotajlo, to pepper him with questions, while just a few stragglers approached Kapoor.I admittedly had a hard time with all this, and just a couple hours in, I began to feel pretty uncomfortable—not because I was concerned with what the rationalists were saying about AGI, but because my apparent inability to occupy the same plane of reality was so profound. In none of these talks did I hear any concrete mechanism described through which an AI might become capable of usurping power and enacting mass destruction, or a particularly plausible process through which a system might develop to \"decide\" to orchestrate mass destruction, or the ways it would navigate and/or commandeer the necessary physical hardware to wreak its carnage via a worldwide hodgepodge of different interfaces and coding languages of varying degrees of obsolescence and systems that already frequently break down while communicating with each other. I saw a deep fear that large language models were improving quickly, that the improvements in natural language processing had been so rapid in the last few years that if the lines on the graphs held, we'd be in uncharted territory before long, and maybe already were. But much of the apocalyptic theorizing, as far as I could tell, was premised on AI systems learning how to emulate the work of an AI researcher, becoming more proficient in that field until it is automated entirely. Then these automated AI researchers continue automating that increasingly advanced work, until a threshold is crossed, at which point an AGI emerges. More and more automated systems, and more and more sophisticated prediction software, to me, do not guarantee the emergence of a sentient one. And the notion that this AGI will then be deadly appeared to come from a shared assumption that hyper-intelligent software programs will behave according to tenets of evolutionary psychology, conquering perceived threats to survive, or desirous of converting all materials around it (including humans) into something more useful to its ends. That also seems like a large and at best shaky assumption.There was little credence or attention paid to recent reports that have shown the pace of progress in the frontier models has slowed—many I spoke to felt this was a momentary setback, or that those papers were simply overstated—and there seemed to be a widespread propensity for mapping assumptions that may serve in engineering or in the tech industry onto much broader social phenomena. When extrapolating into the future, many AI safety researchers seemed comfortable making guesses about the historical rate of task replacement in the workplace begot by automation, or how quickly remote workers would be replaced by AI systems (another key road-to-AGI metric for the rationalists). One AI safety expert said, let's just assume in the past that automation has replaced 30% of workplace tasks every generation, as if this were an unknowable thing, as if there were not data about historical automation that could be obtained with research, or as if that data could be so neatly quantified into such a catchy truism. I could not help but think that sociologists and labor historians would have had a coronary on the spot; fortunately, none seem to have been invited.A lot of these conversations seemed to be animated displays of mutual bias confirmation, in other words, between folks who are surely quite good at computational mathematics, or understanding LLM training benchmarks, but who all share similar backgrounds and preoccupations, and who seem to spend more time examining AI output than how it's translating into material reality. It often seemed like folks were excitedly participating in a dire, high-stakes game, trying to win it with the best-argued case for alignment, especially when they were quite literally excitedly participating in a game; Sunday morning was dedicated to a 3-hour tabletop role-playing game meant to realistically simulate the next few years of AI development, to help determine what the AI-dominated future of geopolitics held, and whether humanity would survive.The AGI game in action.(In the game, which was played by 20 or so attendees divided into two teams, AGI is realized around 2027, the US government nationalizes OpenAI, Elon Musk is put in charge of the new organization, a sort of new Manhattan Project for AI, and competition heats up with China; fortunately, the AI was aligned properly, so in the end, humanity is not extinguished. Some of the players were almost disappointed. \"We won on a technicality,\" one said.)The tech press was there, too—Platformer's Casey Newton, myself, the New York Times' Kevin Roose, and Vox's Kelsey Piper, Garrison Lovely, and others. At one point, some of us were sitting on a couch surrounded by Anthropic guys, including co-founder Jack Clark. They were talking about why the public remained skeptical of AI, and someone suggested it was due to the fact that people felt burned by crypto and the metaverse, and just assumed AI was vaporware too. They discussed keeping journals to record what it was like working on AI right now, given the historical magnitude of the moment, and one of the Anthropic staff mentioned that the Manhattan Project physicists kept journals at Los Alamos, too.It was pretty easy to see why so much of the national press coverage has been taken with the \"doomer\" camps like the one gathered at Lighthaven—it is an intensely dramatic story, intensely believed by many rich and intelligent people. Who doesn't want to get the story of the scientists behind the next Manhattan Project—or be a scientist wrestling with the complicated ethics of the next world-shattering Manhattan Project-scale breakthrough? Or making that breakthrough? Not possessing a degree in computer science, or having studied natural language processing for years myself, if even a third of my AI sources were so sure that an all-powerful AI is on the horizon, that would likely inform my coverage, too. No one is immune to biases; my partner is a professor of media studies, perhaps that leads me to skew more critical to the press, or to be overly pedantic in considering the role of biasses in overly long articles like this one. It's even possible I am simply too cynical to see a real and present threat to humanity, though I don't think that's the case. Of course I wouldn't. So many of the AI safety folks I met were nice, earnest, and smart people, but I couldn't shake the sense that the pervasive AI worry wasn't adding up. As I walked the grounds, I'd hear snippets of animated chatter; \"I don't want to over-index on regulation\" or \"imagine 3x remote worker replacement\" or \"the day you get ASI you're dead though.\" But I heard little to no organizing. There was a panel with an AI policy worker who talked about how to lobby DC politicians to care about AI risk, and a screening of a documentary in progress about SB 1047, the AI safety bill that Gavin Newsom vetoed, but apart from that, there was little sense that anyone had much interest in, you know, fighting for humanity. And there were plenty of employees, senior researchers, even executives from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google's Deepmind right there in the building!If you are seriously, legitimately concerned that an emergent technology is about to *exterminate humanity* within the next three years, wouldn't you find yourself compelled to do more than argue with the converted about the particular elements of your end times scenario? Some folks were involved in pushing for SB 1047, but that stalled out; now what? Aren't you starting an all-out effort to pressure those companies to shut down their operations ASAP? That all these folks are under the same roof for three days, and no one's being confronted, or being made uncomfortable, or being protested—not even a little bit—is some of the best evidence I've seen that all the handwringing over AI Safety and x-risk really is just the sort of amped-up cosplaying its critics accuse it of being. And that would be fine, if it wasn't taking oxygen from other pressing issues with AI, like AI systems' penchant for perpetuating discrimination and surveillance, degrading labor conditions, running roughshod over intellectual property, plagiarizing artists' work, and so on. Some attendees openly weren't interested in any of this. The politics in the space appeared to skew rightward, and some relished the way AI promises to break open new markets, free of regulations and constrictions. A former Uber executive, who admitted openly that what his last company did \"was basically regulatory arbitrage\" now says he plans on launching fully automated AI-run businesses, and doesn't want to see any regulation at all. Late Saturday night, I was talking with a policy director, a local freelance journalist, and a senior AI researcher for one of the big AI companies. I asked the AI developer if it bothered him that if everything said at the conference thus far was to be believed, his company was on the cusp of putting millions of people out of work. He said yeah, but what should we do about it? I mentioned an idea or two, and said, you know, his company doesn't have to sell enterprise automation software. A lot of artists and writers were already seeing their wages fall right now. The researcher looked a little pained, and laughed bleakly. It was around that point that the journalist shared that he had made $12,000 that year. The AI researcher easily might have made 30 times that. It echoed a conversation I had with Jack Clark, of Anthropic. It was a bit strange to see him here, in this context; years ago, he'd been a tech journalist, too, and we'd run in some of the same circles. We'd met for coffee some years ago, around when he'd left journalism to start a comms gig at OpenAI, where he'd do a stint before leaving to co-found Anthropic. At first I wonder if it's awkward because I'm coming off my second mass layoff event in as many media jobs, and he's now an executive of a $40 billion company, but then I recall that I'm a member of the press, and he probably just doesn't want to talk to me. He said that what AI is doing to labor might get government to finally spark a conversation about AI's power, and to take it seriously. I wondered—wasn't his company profiting from selling the automation services that was threatening labor in the first place? Anthropic does not, after all, have to partner with Amazon and sell task-automating software. Clark says that's a good point, a good question, and they're gathering data to better understand exactly how job automation is unfolding, and he hopes to be able to make it public. \"I want to release some of that data, to spark a conversation,\" he said.I press him about the AGI business, too. Given he is a former journalist, I can't help but wonder if on some level he doesn't fully buy the imminent super-intelligence narrative either. But he doesn't bite. I ask him if he thinks that AGI, as a construct, is useful in helping executives and managers absolve themselves and their companies of actions that might adversely effect people. \"I don't think they think about it,\" Clark said, excusing himself. The contradictions were overwhelming, and omnipresent. Yet relatively few people here were disagreeing. AGI was an inexorable force, to be debated, even wept over, as it risked destroying us all. I do not intend to demean these concerns, just question them, and what's really going on here. It was all thrown into even sharper relief for me, when, just two weeks after the Curve, I attended a conference in DC on nuclear security, and listened to a former Commander of Stratcom discuss plainly how close we are to the brink of nuclear war, no AI required, at any given time. A phone call would do the trick. I checked out of the Curve confident that there is no conspiracy afoot in Silicon Valley to convince everyone AI is apocalyptically powerful. I left with the sense that there are some smart people in AI—albeit often with apparently limited knowledge of real-world politics, sociology, or industrial history—who see systems improving, have genuine and deep concerns, and other people in AI who find that deep concern very useful for material purposes. Together, they have cultivated a unique and emotionally charged hyper-capitalist value system with its own singular texture, one that is deeply alienating to anyone who has trouble accepting certain premises. I don't know if I have ever been more relieved to leave a conference.The net result, it seems to me, is that the AGI/ASI story imbues the work of building automation software with elevated importance. Framing the rise of AGI as inexorable helps executives, investors, and researchers, even the doom-saying ones, to effectively minimize the qualms of workers and critics worried about more immediate implications of AI software. You have to build a case, an AI executive said at a widely attended talk at the conference, comparing raising concerns over AGI to the way that the US built its case for the invasion of Iraq. But that case was built on faulty evidence, an audience member objected. It was a hell of a demo, though, the AI executive said.

Like many of Almodóvar’s films, the film features a relationship between two women, Ingrid (Julianne Moore) and Martha (Tilda Swinton); the latter now has terminal cancer, and they rekindle their friendship after years of estrangement. The film centers upon a “big ask”—will Ingrid be in the “room next door” while Martha takes a euthanasia pill to end her life? Inexplicably, Martha decides to broach this topic with Ingrid while they sit in the lobby of Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall. Imagine watching this scene at the Lincoln Center theater, that brief meta-cinematic thrill—the viewer is not just next door to the characters on-screen; they are in the very same room.

They'll know this because I have started the past four posts on gaby del valle dot substack dot com with a preface on how I've been off the grid trying to write my book. When I say \"off the grid\" I really mean it. I did back-to-back residencies in the Adirondacks, one of which had very limited wifi and one of which has no wifi at all. I have to hook my phone up to an ethernet cable to text my friends. All of this is to say that until very recently I was blissfully reading New York Times articles from 1883 and blissfully unaware of the Sydney Sweeney jeans discourse, praise be to God. But now I am at the accursed Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport en route to the even more accursed city of Nashville for a reporting trip1 and I am once again on that damn phone. And I regret to inform you that I have some thoughts about the Sydney Sweeney jeans discourse, though I have virtually nothing to say about the ad itself.The ad is meaningless. The ad, as wrote, is about Sydney Sweeney being hot. There were no Mad Men creative geniuses involved in its creation. There was no Don Draper in the room, and there was certainly no Peggy Olson. Maybe a few years ago someone in the writers room would have been like, \"is it weird to imply that a blonde white woman has good genes?\" and maybe a different ad would've gotten made and maybe that does mean there's been some kind of Vibe Shift. Is Sydney Sweeney a Republican? Maybe, I don't know. Probably, even! She's rich, even if she has convinced herself that she is not. Remember how way back in 2022 people got mad at her for saying she doesn't have enough money to take a six-month break? Sydney Sweeney, unlike some of her Euphoria castmates, is not a nepo baby. And therefore Sydney Sweeney must work all the time to afford the kind of lifestyle the public expects of a starlet, which is why she did the American Eagle ad: because she will do and say just about anything for a check.This is not a value judgement. It is what it is. I'm sure Sydney Sweeney has a rich inner life and maybe even an artistic vision. But a rich inner life and an artistic vision don't pay the bills. You know what does? Selling bars of soap made of your bathwater. Being the kind of woman that would've made teenage boys horny in 1985 and still makes the men who were once those boys horny today. Some of this is due to Sydney Sweeney's genes/jeans, but a lot of it is part of a carefully crafted public persona. The Sydney Sweeney the public sees is a walking Gone Girl cool girl monologue. That Sydney Sweeney works on vintage cars. That Sydney Sweeney would never say hey asshole my eyes are up here because she makes her money not by acting in art films but by starring in ads about how hot she is.Maybe in a different America the jeans/genes pun would scan as being a joke about Sydney Sweeney's symmetrical face and big naturals, but we are living in this America, and in this America we are constantly being suffused with fascist imagery. Benny Johnson is taking soyface selfies outside Alligator Alcatraz. The concentration camp is selling merch. The Department of Homeland Security is posting, like, Thomas Kinkade streetscapes alongside the 14 words. They're posting John Gast's American Progress2 and sneaking 1488 into the caption. The president is saying Sydney Sweeney \"has the HOTTEST ad out there.\" These things are not the same but maybe they are related, and yet none of it is Sydney Sweeney's fault or her problem. Honestly I'm annoyed I'm even talking about this, but I promise I have a point that has nothing—or at least very little—to do with Sydney Sweeney.it's honestly so annoying when they post stuff like this because like guys that's mY BOOK i can't write fast enough to keep up!!! goddamn!!!!!You may recall that Sydney Sweeney is from Spokane, Washington. She reminded the public of this in an SNL monologue last year as a sort of defense in another nonsensical controversy. \"I'm from a town called Spokane, right on the border of Washington and Idaho. I feel a bond to both states. Like when people ask 'Where are you from?' I say Washington. And when people ask, 'Did you go to a Trump-themed party for your mom?' I say I-da-ho.\" If there's one thing people know about Northern Idaho it's that it's full of white supremacists. Last year I went to visit my best friend's hometown of Moscow, Idaho, and whenever I told anyone about it they'd say oh the Nazi town? And I had to say no, actually, that's Coeur d'Alene; Moscow is the Christian nationalist town. But Washington isn't exactly some blue-haired lib paradise either. I mean sure, there's Seattle, the summer of 2020-era CHAZ, etc.3 Beyond the Pacific Coast, however, Washington is pretty conservative. But that's not even the point. I'm not interested in Sydney Sweeney's home state because I'm interested in how she or anyone else from there votes; I'm interested in it because of its role in the West's eugenic projects at the turn of the twentieth century.Washington passed a sterilization law in 1909,4 making it the second state to do so after Indiana. A subsequent law, the 1921 \"Prevention of Procreation,\" act, allowed Washington's state government to forcibly sterilize \"epileptics,\" \"the feeble-minded,\" \"habitual criminals,\" \"sexual perverts,\" and \"moral degenerates.\" By 1931, more than half of US states had some sort of compulsory sterilization law on the books. Despite being an early adopter of eugenic policies, Washington seems to have carried out few compulsory sterilizations under the 1909 and 1921 laws: 685 people were operated on without their consent in Washington while the law was in effect, compared to 20,108 in California, which also passed a sterilization law in 1909.Twenty-seven states implemented eugenic sterilization laws between 1909 and 1931. (from E.S. Gosney's \"Eugenic Sterilization\" in the July 1934 edition of Scientific American)The relative lack of compulsory sterilizations in Washington doesn't mean the state wasn't interested in cultivating a certain kind of population; it means that it was more successful in doing so without resorting to punitive measures. California, the leader in eugenic sterilizations, experienced explosive population growth in the decades following the gold rush. Goldseekers from far-flung reaches of the Pacific Rim flocked to California. \"Influences from outside California soon became part of the texture of daily life,\" historian Elliott West writes in Continental Reckoning. \"The brightly colored Mexican banners and flags displayed in one camp reminded an early visitor of Asian bazaars. Hawaiians strolled about in colorful shirts and silk sashes, Chileans in distinctive wide belts and black ponchos, Indians in military coats but no pants.\" They were joined by Chinese, Tasmanian, Peruvian, and white miners, the latter of whom saw the gold fields as theirs by divine mandate and quickly resorted to violence to ensure they would be. White mobs lynched more than 163 Mexicans in California between 1848 and 1860. Chileans, Chineses, and Hawaiians were also targeted. And yet the state could not rid itself of nonwhite laborers. A half-century later, eugenic sterilization emerged as the solution to California's population problem. California, Alexandra Minna Stern writes in Eugenic Nation, \"was by far the most aggressive sterilizer of any state,\" in part because it was among the most racially diverse.Not so in Washington. The state's population didn't crack six figures until 1890, when it surpassed 357,000 people. This explosive growth—a decade earlier, Washington had fewer than 76,000 residents—was largely a result of the completion of the Northern Pacific's line from the Great Lakes to the Puget Sound in 1883. It was the third transcontinental railroad to be built, and also the furthest north. One critic said it went \"from Nowhere, through No-man's Land, to No Place.\" For the railroad to succeed, it needed to attract settlers. And to lure those settlers, the Northern Pacific and other railroads established immigration bureaus across the United States and Northern Europe.5 \"When railroad promoters dreamed of settlers for their lines,\" the historian Jason Pierce writes, \"they dreamed only in white.\" Helen Hunt Jackson toured the Northern Pacific's Bureau of Immigration in Portland, where she saw \"Swedes, Norwegians, Germans, [and Irish]\" cramming into the office, eager to talk to land officers who spoke their language. \"It was touching to see the brightened faces of his countrymen, as their broken English was answered by him in the familiar words of their own tongue,\" Jackson wrote of the Northern Pacific's Norwegian land officer. Unlike California, the Pacific Northwest stayed almost entirely white. What does this have to do with Sydney Sweeney? Nothing, and also everything. The all-American look she possesses is a centuries-old construction. The railroads selected for this look through their immigration agents and populated the West with blonde-haired blue-eyed farmers through their land bureaus, while at the same time denying service to emancipated slaves from the South. The racial demographics of the Pacific Northwest, like those of the rest of the country, have changed significantly over the past century. To the right, Sydney Sweeney embodies a bygone era, even though, as Doreen St. Félix recently noted in the New Yorker, she's a natural brunette. Genes, like jeans, are passed down from a parent to their offspring. Sydney Sweeney's jeans are blue just like her eyes, and any child she has in the future may very well come out blonde even if her own hair color comes from a box. Now as in the past, the illusion matters more than reality.1 I'd tell you what I'm reporting on but it's a secret. Shhhh!2I saw it at the Autry museum and it's soooo tiny in person btw3Seattle libs are what sent Chris Rufo down his dark path. 4sorry to the nice lady sitting next to me on this flight who had to watch me google \"washington eugenic sterilization law\" from 30,000 feet in the air. 5I wrote about a very fun example of these colonization schemes in a previous post",

      "content": "Greetings from Read Max! In todays's newsletter, two items:An exploration of \"Elara Voss,\" a mysterious figure haunting megaplatforms and L.L.M.s, anda genealogy of Stomp Clap Hey, occasioned by discourse regarding the band \"Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes.\"A reminder: Read Max is just one guy--me--and all of the reading, writing, thinking, and stupid chart-making is down to me. Producing 5,000 words every week is a full-time job, which I know because I keep failing to deliver on freelance assignments while I do this newsletter, and without the support of paying subscribers I wouldn't be able to do it to nearly this level of quality (or stupidity).

What's more, there are hundreds of books on Amazon and other self-publishing platforms that feature a character named \"Elara Voss,\" among them Veil of the Bloodwight Syndicate, Gynarchy's Collar, and Starlight Nexus by Kylian Quinn: If you go on Instagram or Facebook or Twitter and search for \"Elara Voss,\" you'll find dozens of accounts offering stock tips, \"foot content,\" \"SEO gues posting service [sic]\" and more:What's so odd about this is that--for a name now so common across the megaplatforms--before 2023, \"Elara Voss\" did not exist. There is no person named Elara Voss in the United States. No birth certificate has ever been issued under that name; if you search for it in public records databases, you'll turn up no results. There aren't even any characters named \"Elara Voss\" in any book published before 2023. Until two years ago, the two words didn't ever appear next to each other even by accident. But if you direct almost any L.L.M. to generate a sci-fi story or narrative for you, it will name the main character \"Elara Voss\"--or a similar variation like \"Elara Vex,\" \"Elena Voss,\" or \"Elias Vance\"--with an alarming degree of frequency. Elara Voss is not a real person. Nor is she a public-domain literary character. Nor--yet--a figure of myth or folktale. She's not really anything at all except for name: A string of tokens that has proven irresistibly attractive to a number of different large language models when responding to prompts involving character names and science-fiction and fantasy stories. That is, \"Elara Voss\" is the text that L.L.M.s seem to have have collectively arrived upon as the best response to a prompt like \"what should I name the character in the story I'm writing?\"When, exactly, \"Elara Voss\" and its cognates emerged from the latent space to dominate the Kindle Unlimited store is hard to say. I've seen some people on Twitter hazily suggest that Elara and kin--let's call them promptonyms, to coin a phrase--were present in GPT 3.5 (released in November 2022), but the earliest instance of the names I can find online dates back to August 2023, when an account \"exploring realms through #AIStorytelling & #AIConceptArt\" posted a character sketch of a \"visionary physicist and AI researcher\" named \"Dr. Elara Voss.\" (A \"Dr. Elara Finch\" and a \"Dr. Elara Solis\" each appear a few months earlier.) Voss appears a handful more times on Twitter in similar contexts over the next few months, and pops up on a fan-authored Warhammer 40k wiki as the name of the \"highly respected leader of the Inanis 23rd Voidstalkers.\"But by the same time next year, Elara, Elena, and Elias Voss, Vex, and Vance had become inescapable, to the point that frequent users and A.I.-powered writing apps began to develop specific prompts to avoid them. The promptonyms reportedly appear in every major L.L.M.: GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA, DeepSeek, and Grok. An A.I. tinkerer on Reddit playing around with L.L.M. benchmarks last August found that Google's lightweight Gemma model used the name Elara \"39 times in 3 separate stories,\" and Elias \"29 times in 4 separate stories.\" None of the commenters were surprised: \"every time I try using any models for creative writing, doesn't matter whether it's gpt-4, mistral, llama, etc, always the same names come up like Elara or Whispering Woods, etc.,\" one wrote. (Alongside \"Whispering Woods,\" you can file \"Eldora\" as the name of a magic kingdom.) Elara Voss seems to be the promptonym generated most often, others like \"Aris Thorne\" (\"Why is Dr. Aris Thorne everywhere?\" one Redditor wondered) and \"Elias Vance\" are found frequently too:In fact, a whole host of tropes and concepts seem to accompany Dr. Elara wherever she's found. The prototypical \"Elara Voss,\" as described by a text generator, is a doctor, usually a physicist but sometimes a linguist or biologist. (Other times, she's a spaceship captain.) She's generally on the verge of a major breakthrough or discovery (often cosmic or even metaphysical in nature), or is researching some kind of \"anomaly,\" but is isolated, troubled, and sometimes \"haunted\" by what she's learning. She's often found \"trembling\" or her heart is racing; instruments near her are usually \"pulsing.\" The name \"Erebus\" often appears in Dr. Elara stories: a \"Project Erebus\" on which Dr. Elena Vex is working, or a mining colony named \"Erebus-IX\" to which Dr. Elias Vance must travel, or even a \"rogue A.I.\" called Erebus, \"neutralized\" by Dr. Elara Voss.To the more esoterically inclined A.I. schizoposter, Dr. Elara's omnipresence, and the consistency of the motifs generated around her, endow her with a kind of mythological or folkloric quality: She's a divinity, or a culture hero, about whom a set of relatively predictable stories are told. (You can only imagine the kinds of quackery Jung or Joseph Campbell would have gotten up to, given access to L.L.M.s) In this capacity she joins other A.I. cryptids or tulpas--figures like the A.I. ghost \"Loab\" or the \"glitch token\" \"petertodd\"--in a sort of ever-raveling A.I. \"lore\" popular among influencers and some even researchers. There's a strong culture of semi-ironic mysticism around L.L.M.s among people who both genuinely believe in their power and who also understand that creepy fanfic is a powerful marketing tool for the technology. (And that solid ironic-mystical tweets will go viral.)Admittedly, I too have a hard time not giving in to the spooky pleasures of imagining a pantheon of A.I. tulpas emerging from the latent space, a new mythos derived from the hidden structures of our culture. But there are also less occult ways of accounting for the frequency with which Elara and her fellow promptonyms appear. As many people have pointed out, there's a significant character in World of Warcraft named \"Lilian Voss,\" and the volume of text publicly available online about the WoW universe in the form of wikis, walk-throughs, and YouTube transcriptions likely gives the lore a gravitational pull in most models. If you trace back, e.g., Gemma's decision-making process you can see that \"character names,\" as well as \"science fiction\" and \"fantasy,\" are all closely linked in the model to a \"text about World of Warcraft\" neuron, as Abram Jackson shows here and a user called beowulf shows here. (Similarly, there's a character named \"Elara Dorne\" in Star Wars: The Old Republic, a voluminously covered M.M.O.R.P.G. like WoW. It's a good reminder that L.L.M.s reflect \"culture\" in the narrow sense of \"the culture of text publicly available on the internet in great volume.\")As for her ubiquity across models, that's almost to be expected. All the largest models are trained on effectively the same corpus--i.e., \"almost all publicly available text\"--and the processes by which they are made smooth and sanitary for public release sand down particular differences even further. (They're also likely training on each other's responses, which should lead to additional convergence.)So you might say that Dr. Elara Voss is an emergent legend whose qualities reflect a deep mathematical structure underlying our culture. You might also say she's a statistical agglomeration of science-fiction cliché borne of oversampling video-game wikis. I'm not sure that either of those views is wrong, precisely! What I do know is that we should enjoy her while she lasts: By the next generation of models, she'll almost certainly have been eliminated. As much as we might enjoy the idea of A.I. lore, the companies selling the tech (as fiction-writing software, among other things!) don't like the kind of consistency that points to something other than total magic occurring under the hood.Where did \"stomp-clap\" come from?This week on Twitter a video of the band \"Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes\" performing their hit single \"Home\" on NPR's Tiny Desk in 2010 was widely circulated with the caption \"worst song ever made\":\"Home\" is only the worst song ever if you've never watched one of CatatonicYouths' TikTok music compilations. But the video's hold over Twitter, and the arguments and misconceptions it has generated, have convinced me that the song is nonetheless culturally important. Here, e.g., is someone describing \"Home\" as \"stomp clap hey\" music, a coinage generally used to categorize Mumford and Sons, the Lumineers, and other anthemic stadium-folk bands that dominated retail playlists in the 2010s:But is \"Home\" actually \"stomp clap hey\" music? A debate is currently raging on Twitter about the precise provenance of \"stomp clap\": As other scholars have pointed out, musically speaking \"Home\" bears closer resemblance to a band like Peter Bjorn & John than it does to the car-advertisement bangers of a Mumford & Sons, and the ultimate stomp-clap template owes more of a debt to Arcade Fire than it does to Edward Sharpe. (\"Stomp clap\" is more or less what you get when you replace the French Canadian DNA in Arcade Fire with even more Mormonism, or, alternatively Britishness.) On the other hand, the down-home old-timey cosplay of the lyrics and vibe of \"Home\" (not to mention its success as a single) mark it as a clear cultural forerunner to stomp clap. It seems increasingly clear with hindsight that \"Home\" represented a kind of evolutionary link or turning point in the journey from Pitchfork Indie to Stomp Clap Hey--a band with feet planted in both worlds. (\"Edward Sharpe\" himself was formerly in an electroclash band called Ima Robot.) But the actual genealogy of Stomp Clap, as a genre and an aesthetic, is much more diverse and intricate. To help people more fully understand the complex lineage of Stomp Clap Hey, Read Max has prepared the following diagram. Please share with anyone you know confused about where Stomp Clap Hey came from:The flowchart has been updated since publication to better reflect the position of Mormonism in the genealogy of Stomp Clap Hey.Previously in hipster studies on Read Max: What was the hipster?Previously in anthems on Read Max: Fypcore and the Benson Boone-iverse",

It’s not every minute, or even every day, but maybe once a week, I’m hit by it—slackjawed, staring into the middle distance—frozen by the prospect that someday, maybe pretty soon, everyone will lose their job. At first, I thought these slackjawed fits were just a phase, a passing thing. I’m a philosophy professor; staring into the middle distance isn’t exactly an unknown disease among my kind. But as the years have begun to pass, and the fits have not, I’ve begun to wonder if there’s something deeper to my dread. Does the coming automation of work foretell, as my fits seem to say, an irreparable loss of value in human life? The titans of artificial intelligence tell us that there’s nothing to fear. Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, the maker of Claude, suggests that: “historical hunter-gatherer societies might have imagined that life is meaningless without hunting,” and “that our well-fed technological society is devoid of purpose.” But of course, we don’t see our lives that way. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, sounds so similar, the text could have been written by ChatGPT. Even if the jobs of the future will look as “fake” to us as ours do to “a subsistence farmer”, Altman has “no doubt they will feel incredibly important and satisfying to the people doing them.” Alongside these optimists, there are plenty of pessimists who, like me, are filled with dread.

Rich consumers will get housing, while poor residents will only end up displaced out of their homes.This is wrong. All housing is housing. In fact, in some sense all goods are other goods, because they all trade off against a consumer's budget constraint. When a developer builds luxury apartments, it diverts high income consumers away from other, lower-quality housing, which in turn diverts others, until eventually it has filtered down to the lower classes. Building luxury housing is equivalent to building affordable housing.You don't need to take my word for it – we can trace back the entire chain of people moving. Finland has extremely detailed data on where people live. Bartu, Harjun, and Saarimaa (2023) look at the previous address of people who move into newly constructed housing, and then at the address of the people who moved into the vacated housing; and so on, six rounds of moves down the line. By the fourth round, half the people able to move to better housing came from below median income. Building 100 units of market rate housing in the center of Helsinki is the equivalent of building 66 units of housing in below median income neighborhoods, and the equivalent of 31 units of housing for the bottom quintile. Mast (2021) does the same exercise for the United States, though he has less precise data and must rely upon the characteristics of the neighborhood which people move from. Housing anywhere reduces the price of housing everywhere.Subscribe nowNor does building cause a local increase in rents. There are a number of studies looking at the local impacts of new construction, and they unanimously find that construction reduces local rents. Asquith, Mast and Reed (2019) use a difference-in-differences approach in 11 major US cities with data from Zillow, exploiting idiosyncratic differences in when housing was completed. They found that nearby rents decreased between 5 and 7 percent, and that poor people are more likely to migrate to the area around the new construction. Kate Pennington (2020) uses building fires as an instrumental variable for new buildings. After a building burns down, developers build back better and create more housing than was there before. She can then show that the people who live nearby are actually 17% less likely to be displaced. Building more housing reduces gentrification. Andreas Mense (2025) uses weather shocks as an instrument, on the grounds that heavy rainfall and the intensity of winter frost will both delay construction, in some cases until the next year. (Most outdoor construction stops over the winter). What I appreciate about this paper is that the two instruments are demonstrably uncorrelated with each other. You might have guessed the results already, but building more housing is beneficial to everyone. Read more",
