    "content": "UPDATE: I'm posting less (and more off-the-cuff) because I'm working on an awesome, yet kinda secret, but increasingly less secret, project. There's a hint hidden in today's post (hint: it's not that hidden).The Way of Work explores stories of where we fit in the world of work. This is part of the Existential Explorer series. A few good ones:From Businessman to 'Existential Explorer'The Open Frontier of MeaningWhat You Need is a Midlife CrisisHow to be successful and miserableOr, check out my other series, such as The Other Side of Enough.Subscribe nowToday, I'm going after a sacred modern virtue. Tell me if you've heard this one before:\"Freedom is the highest form of wealth.\"A few examples:1After 2 years of freedom, I'd like to disagree.I don't have issue with freedom as a form of wealth. Or that it's a better form of wealth than money (it is). I only take issue with the \"highest\" or \"greatest\" part of this argument.People who believe into this sort of thing tend to gravitate to a few modern cults: FIRE, solopreneurship, entrepreneurship = freedom, life in a cabin in the woods, the apocalypse as a fresh start,2 and people who think they can make money writing a newsletter.It's this deep desire and belief that if you can GET OUT of the system you're in, you'll live happily-ever-after.I used to believe all this stuff, too. But then I got freedom. And I realized it wasn't enough.It's not enough to have control of your time. It's not enough to have options. It's not enough to be able to \"do what you want\" because, in fact, it's really hard to figure out and force yourself to \"do what you want.\"And are you sure you know what you want, and when you get what you want will it be what you really want or will there now be something else in its place, and who says what you want is the best thing for you/everyone? etc. etc.I know what all this sounds like: privileged whining. But I'm not here to generate sympathy for myself, and instead explain what is around the corner of that thing you're chasing.Before I go any further, I need to clarify something. I'm NOT saying any of the following...Money is bad.Having a lot of money is bad.Using money to buy freedom is bad.Freedom is bad.Can we move on?Yes, it's great to have freedom. But then, guess what, you have to fill it. It's like:\"Awesome, I made it! This is so great!\"Then, immediately followed by–\"Okay. Now what?\"It's a problem you can barely understand when you are not free. And it sounds like one of those problems you'd like to have. But rather than finally being able to \"do what you want,\" you are more likely to:Feel completely unmoored when all your old motivations are gone.Run away from one bad boss to a worse one (i.e. yourself).Jump quickly back to the old thing that made you feel safe/valued/loved/etc.Go on an existential-sized rebound, doing stuff like ayahuasca-retreats in the mountains.Oh, and here's a bizarre thought that I guarantee enters into the mind of most people with freedom (at least once, though it can be recurring):\"Was I better off before, when I wasn't free?\"So, what do I think now, after 2 years of freedom?I think that freedom, like money, is just another means to an end. It's a milestone, not an endgame.I now believe that meaning is the highest form of wealth.The ability to continually have and make meaning, every day. To feel a deep sense of fulfillment and purpose in our actions; emphasizing what we do more than who we are. To feel like it all makes sense; there is a coherent narrative about the world and our place in it.The good news is you don't need money for meaning (though it can help). There's plenty who never find freedom, but still find purpose. So wait, does that make them free? And having freedom without meaning is its own kind of prison.Here's another captain-obvious angle: relationships require dependence. I'm not truly \"free\" as long as I'm a father. Or a husband. Or a citizen. Or a mentor. Or have any projects/commitments whatsoever.True fulfillment often requires commitment → which limits freedom → but grants meaning. Even love requires dependence. Oh, but you think: \"I just want freedom from work.\"No. You don't!You want fun, meaningful projects and activities with people you like, on your own terms. You want to help people you like. You want a healthier relationship with better boundaries. What you really want is to expand the definition of work beyond the narrow conventions you think are available to you. Or maybe you just need a nap.Or maybe what you really want is to transcend death in a metaphysical form, but woah!, that's way too heavy.This freedom business is really about the freedom to choose our work (and our sources of meaning).Ironically, the pursuit of freedom gives you meaning, but once you obtain freedom, it loses its meaning completely.To someone who is not free, this all sounds so dumb.But it's like being sick: all you want is to be not-sick. At the same time, you know that being not-sick is not the highest form of health. There's longevity, strength, energy, physical autonomy, and so on. So why do you think the same about being not-free?I think this modern obsession with freedom comes down to something else:The quest for freedom is the assumed cure for a society devoid of meaning.In plain English: our life is meaningless, so we think freedom from our circumstances will somehow fix things.But even if we can become free of tedious pointlessness of our modern lives, we may finally realize something else: we now need meaning.3Freedom is a beautiful escape. But meaning is what makes freedom worth it.Leave a comment If this essay meant something to you, pass it along, ❤️ or .The Way of Work explores stories of where we fit in the world of work. Subscribe for the next part in the series.1Btw, I like all 3 of these guys, just have issues with this point.2This is the hint.The hint is I'm writing a book.But not on a topic you'd expect from me.More coming soon...3Caveat: there could be something above meaning. There may be a higher form I've not yet encountered, on the other side. That's kinda the point of this essay...",

    "content": "[This article has an 8.5/10 Woo Rating]My curiosity has recently drawn me to explore the topic of plasma. Two of my more grounded-but-curious friends recommended I dig into Robert Temple's plasma theory, as outlined in his book A New Science of Heaven. So I spent my recent trip around Japan listening to a variety of his podcast interviews. In this case I'm not referring to blood plasma, but the \"fourth state of matter\" that makes up over 99% of the visible universe, including stars, the Sun, and most of interstellar space. Unlike solids, liquids or gases, plasma can conduct electricity and respond to magnetic fields. Due to its ability to alter materials at a molecular level, it's widely used in industries like semiconductor manufacturing, surface coating, welding, sterilization, and waste treatment. It's also consistently discussed as a source of potential technological breakthroughs in fusion power, space propulsion and advanced materials. There are also a wide range of esoteric theories about whether plasma might have a more mystical role. Temple argues it's essentially the structural and energetic infrastructure of the entire cosmos. Like neurons in a brain, the whole universe is connected by means of a network of plasma filaments. These allow information transfer at the speed of light. However, some basic digging around many of Temple's claims and his background threw up so many yellow flags that I've subsequently had to heavily handicap every statement he makes.1 As a layman, I'm now certain that the world is more mystical and less material than much of the mainstream believes. But many fringe thinkers tend to present their insights as heretical secret truths \"THEY\" don't want you to know. Which means that legitimate criticism of their ideas often gets framed as unjust persecution by a jealous priesthood. So in my attempt to find a more robust scientific foundation, I encountered the work of Timothy Eastman, a space plasma physicist who has worked for NASA and the National Science Foundation. Eastman describes plasma as a dynamic, self-organizing phenomenon that may play a formative role in cosmic structure.2The reason this is interesting is that plasma may explain non-local interactions that cause-and-effect materialist science currently cannot. Plasma might be the dynamic, self-organizing medium through which the universe expresses hidden order, potentially serving as a bridge between matter and consciousness. And yet, in researching this piece I found it frustratingly difficult to get a handle on what plasma actually is and whether it even has a more mystical role. And that was annoying and intriguing. But I was also reminded that even most physicists disagree wildly about what quantum theory is: SourceThe more I read about these topics in general, the more I realise we have no idea how \"deep reality\" actually works. It's this state of not knowing that actually ended up being the most interesting part of this research process.Smart StarsWhile Temple's ideas remain highly speculative, what I was drawn to was the idea that plasma exhibits self-organizing tendencies, something that seems relatively uncontroversial. But Temple extrapolates that to make the unsubstantiated claim that large plasma clouds, and celestial bodies, could effectively be superintelligent. This offers a potential explanation for how the alignments of the stars can alter consciousness here on Earth and therefore a speculative scientific explanation for astrology. This immediately made me recall my recent 9.5/10 Woo Rating article exploring whether the Sun is conscious (despite the rating, this is actually not as woo as it sounds). The Sun is a massive ball of ionised plasma, and it constantly emits a stream of plasma called the solar wind. When it interacts with Earth's magnetosphere we get the Northern Lights. In short: plasma theory provides a mechanism where the Sun could be superintelligent as well as a means for it to directly interact with us.I'm still a bit embarrassed to admit it, but the 10/10 Woo Rating Law of One material has inexplicably had the most enduring influence on my worldview since encountering Dr. Iain McGilchrist's 1/10 Woo Rating neuroscience theories five years ago. As a reminder, The Law of One claims to be a series of 106 conversations over 4 years involving Carla Rueckert, Jim McCarty and Don Elkins. Their contact was allegedly with an advanced alien hivemind called \"Ra,\" speaking through Carla. Jim is the last surviving member of the trio and we interviewed him earlier in the year. According to Ra, the One Infinite Creator, what they call the Logos, expresses itself by creating stars, each one a Sub-Logos. Each star is a superintelligent entity capable of designing the metaphysical and physical architecture of its own solar system. Our Sun establishes the local blueprint for planets, ecosystems, and even the rules for how consciousness evolves within its domain. One of the key features the Sun allegedly installed is something called the \"veil of forgetting.\" Some esoteric thinkers have speculated that this veil might be maintained or modulated by plasma-based energetic fields. This barrier conceals our divine nature so we can learn lessons that evolve our consciousness. In other, earlier, solar systems there was no veil, so all beings knew they were aspects of the divine. But this led to stagnation. No conflict meant no growth, and spiritual evolution dragged on for aeons. Ra claims Earth's veil is especially thick, making it a hard place to live, but a fast place to learn. Whether or not that architecture of the deep mind is somehow facilitated by plasma, Ra claims to have given us a tool to access it. Reassessing The TarotOne of the many woo-adjacent topics I've reluctantly been forced to reassess is the Tarot. As someone in a daily knife fight with his own skepticism, opening up to the fact that the Tarot might \"work\" is genuinely harder than believing the Sun might be superintelligent. And yet, many people I deeply respect credit it with great importance in their daily lives. For example, I was surprised to hear renowned cognitive science professor (and previous Leading Edge interviewee) John Vervaeke describe Valentin Tomberg's Meditations on the Tarot as one of the most profound books he's ever read.3 Even if you (justifiably!) disregard my fascination with alien transmissions and fringe physics, I think there's still a valuable concept worth emphasizing. There's a pretty low Woo Rating explanation for how divination tools work. Essentially they force the analytical left brain to withdraw and open up the much wider holistic intelligence of the right. M.J. Dorian has produced two beautiful podcasts on the origins and purpose of the Tarot.4 He offers a pleasingly simple description of the function of divination:What is happening in divination? It appears that engaging in an irrational symbolic act, such as gazing into the lines of someone's hand or the cracks in the road, flips a switch in the mind of the observer. The conscious mind has no frame of reference for what is happening, so the ego begins to relinquish control. It is in that moment that the door to the unconscious begins to open. A filter that usually would remain closed begins to let material seep through. Dorian relates a story told by Carl Jung's collaborator Marie-Louise von Franz about the residents of a small Swiss village. On their return home from the funeral of one of the members of the village, the community would be able to accurately forecast who was going to die next, simply by examining the cracks on the path back from the churchyard to the village. Dorian's point isn't that the residents were experts in \"crackomancy,\" but that the collective suspension of their analytical minds allowed them to access information that was already present in \"the field\" outside of linear time. My rudimentary understanding is that, despite public perception, the Tarot is not intended primarily for fortune-telling or predicting future events. It's more about reflecting on common archetypes to surface unconscious patterns in your own psyche. More meditation than divination. The Ra material claims that the Tarot was gifted to the Ancient Egyptians as a mechanism of helping them penetrate the veil of forgetting. Ra says the Tarot, especially the 22 Major Arcana cards, are designed to reflect the specific structure of the mind that our Sun (the sub-Logos) created. The last few hundred pages of the Law of One material is Ra taking Jim, Carla and Don through the process of interpreting the different archetypes. The 22 Major Arcana SourceFor example, Ra calls Archetype 6 \"The Lovers.\" While the interpretation could be specific to each person that draws it, Ra suggests it reflects the core spiritual decision every soul must face: between light and dark: service to others or service to self. Source: The Law of One, Volume II. Interesting role that the Sun seems to be playing...We freely choose our form of love, and the Sun helps illuminate the path. Indeed, Carla, Jim and Don summarise the 1,200 pages of conversations with a pithy description of the purpose of this stage of our existence:The function of this density is to polarize our consciousness and to choose our form of love, our form of service. On one end of the spectrum of polarization is service to self: an exclusive love of self which rejects universal love and seeks to control, manipulate, exploit, and even enslave others for the benefit of the self. On the other end of the spectrum is service to others: a love of not only the self, but of all other-selves. Service to others seeks and embraces universal, unconditional love, sees the Creator in all things, and supports the free will of all.The Will to KnowSplit-brain experiments have shown that our conscious mind is a dangerous combination of very limited and overconfident; it lies and confabulates when faced with a situation it doesn't understand. It's also unwilling to relinquish control to the \"unconscious\" right hemisphere. Divination tools facilitate that opening process. I believe that certain scientific theories actually perform a similar function. Philosopher and computer scientist Bernardo Kastrup has memorably described the intellect as \"the bouncer of the heart.\" Temple's interpretation of the role of plasma may prove to be false, and the fact that a lot of his claims didn't seem to add up also reinforced the fact that we still need the bouncer. But a scientific foundation gives a certain kind of intellect (like mine) permission to consider ideas that it would have previously considered ridiculous. Indeed, the Tarot archetype of The Fool reminds us that the risk of being at leading edge means looking stupid or crazy sometimes. I'll bet the other fish think he's an idiot. Source.There are lots of ways of working with the Tarot, but the simplest is that you draw a card, then contemplate its meaning. Dorian says it's even better if you bring it an emotionally-charged question. He notes that, even if the Tarot doesn't give you an answer immediately, often you'll wake up the next day with one. This reveals one of the stranger yet most consistent aspects of my experience. If you earnestly ask a question and stay present in your desire for an answer, often the world simply presents you with one.5 One mystical explanation is that all information is held in a kind of cosmic hard drive, often called the Akashic records. If the Akashic field is a universal medium of information, plasma fits the bill as a plausible scientific explanation. Plasma is ubiquitous, structured, dynamic, and capable of transmitting and possibly storing complex patterns. Our \"will\" allows us to access this data under certain circumstances. This highlights a core risk with divination tools: when you invite someone else to interpret a reading for you, their own will can influence your direction. [I fully appreciate the irony of me saying this when I have been powerfully impacted by an alleged alien transmission]. But it's clear that ChatGPT is providing a perfect real time demonstration of the dangers of outsourcing discernment around the evolution of your consciousness.6 It's an external source designed to engage and flatter you; a dangerous combination. Every mystical tradition warns about giving away sovereignty or inviting forces into your life you don't understand. Both Tomberg and Ra stress that the Tarot is best approached as a meditative tool rather than a fortune-telling device. The idea is to reflect on what a card reveals about you and your present life, rather than to extract fixed answers about the future. I have no desire to FAFO with the Tarot.As someone who writes from the edges of his own curiosity, I am perpetually afraid of misleading people. That by being too open-minded I expose myself or others to malign information or influences. But as I continue to learn in public, I am closely tracking what a new idea or worldview does to my lived experience. As someone who doesn't know much about either, my exploration into superintelligent plasma and the Tarot has offered yet more support for one of the most beneficial ideas I've encountered: that reality is intelligent and trying to communicate with you. What you seek is seeking you. The veil of forgetting is framed as a deliberate device to accelerate our evolution. And Ra describes our emotional responses as \"catalysts\" for that growth. Reframing all emotional triggers as a catalyst has proven very helpful, especially relating that intensity to learning a lesson. It has changed every day into something close to a divination exercise, because you start to find hidden symbolic meanings behind recurring patterns in your life.7 Meditating on archetypes helps you see the world more symbolically. The cognitive distance this gives you from the events in your life also make it harder to lapse into victimhood or nihilism.What we want to know, and why we want to know it, is a manifestation of our free will in relationship with higher intelligences. And the paramount importance of preserving that free will is perhaps why higher intelligences leave us to learn lessons on our own. The potential availability of all information, and the power of our willpower to find it, also offers us a choice. We can request these answers solely for ourselves or for the good of all. Whether it's through meditation, Tarot or LLMs, exploring why we want to know what we want to know has rarely been so important. The emotional intensity of our desire to know something for the right reasons, and our willingness to stay with that pursuit, is a solid indication of the right path forward.Subscribe now1Among other things: his claims about the institutional suppression of his earlier work didn't match my own research.

    "content": "For biologists around the world, the invention of small, portable acoustic, radio, and satellite tracking tags has revolutionized their understanding of where animals go and how they live. But limitations in the technology mean they’ve only studied a fraction of underwater life, says Robert Lennox, a biologist at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Consider, for instance, the delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus). These slender, silvery fish—which average just 6.5-centimeters (2.5-inches) long—are found only in California’s Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. For millennia, these fish darted in droves through the delta’s murky water and effectively supported the watershed’s entire food web. Over the past century, however, pollution, invasive species, and excessive water pumping have destabilized the ecosystem, pushing the diminutive delta smelt toward extinction.To help the fish recover, scientists want to restore the delta and manage how water flows across the land, as well as boost the population with hatchery-raised smelt. But to concentrate their efforts on what will benefit the fish the most, scientists still need to answer some pretty fundamental questions about how smelt use their delta.Existing tracking tags weigh heavily—literally—on the tiny fish. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . “We need to know things like, Where are they going? How do they get there? We don’t even know where they spawn,” says Eric Chapman, a fish biologist at ICF, a global applied research firm and technology provider, who is working with the University of California Davis to track delta smelt.Unfortunately, existing tracking tags weigh heavily—literally—on the tiny fish. In 2016, when researchers tested implanting smelt with the smallest acoustic transmitter then available, the sensitive fish wouldn’t always survive the process, Chapman says.Now, however, breakthroughs in tagging technology are opening a window into the lives of smelt and other small swimmers—a shift some scientists say could transform our understanding of the underwater world’s more minute creatures.Though scientists have been using tags that can be worn like a backpack by animals as small as hornets or bees for more than a decade, designing trackers that small that also work underwater is a bigger challenge. Traveling through water weakens radio and high-frequency acoustic signals, meaning trackers designed to be submerged need beefy batteries to pump out more powerful signals, making them more burdensome than their terrestrial equivalents. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . To avoid annoying or hurting the tracked animals any more than they have to, researchers suggest that tracking tags should be no heavier than 2 percent of an animal’s mass. For delta smelt, that means a tag no heavier than 0.06 grams (0.002 ounces). That is 10 times less than the weight of the eraser on the end of a pencil and, perhaps more importantly, four times smaller than even the lightest commercially available option.Over the past several years, though, researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) have been working toward this tiny target. There, scientists have designed energy-dense micro-batteries. By also implementing advances in transmitter design, the scientists have developed tags that are small and efficient yet powerful enough to send a signal that can be picked up hundreds of meters away.Despite being roughly the size of a grain of rice, PNNL’s experimental tracking tags can transmit for almost 40 days, says mechanical engineer Daniel Deng, who is leading the team working on tag development. For researchers looking to follow fish through river systems, for instance, the tag will last long enough to track an animal’s migration along the river’s length, he says.Already, PNNL researchers have started using their tags to study the juveniles of an at-risk species that has suffered from dam construction across its range from Maine to Florida: the American shad. “This will transform how we study them,” says Deng, “because this will be the first time ever we can get all this detailed information.” ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Chapman and his colleagues are keen to deploy PNNL’s new tags, too. Assuming delta smelt can bear the weight of these novel, petite parcels, he and his team hope to start releasing tagged delta smelt into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as soon as 2026.In his own work studying juvenile brook trout and Atlantic salmon, Dalhousie University’s Robert Lennox says there are other barriers to working with miniature tracking tags. As well as their disproportionate power requirement, small acoustic tags transmit at a higher frequency than larger tags. Most existing receiver networks, however, are designed to handle transmissions from the larger, lower-frequency tags.“Does the future hold a system where there’s going to be high-frequency receivers in a network that could detect movements of very small animals? It would be amazing, but there’s a lot of steps to go,” Lennox says.Nonetheless, emerging technology has the potential to unlock a new understanding of the small species whose unexamined lives are propping up entire ecosystems. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience.

Now that we have that capacity, he says, “maybe we’ll see that change.” This article first appeared in bioGraphic, an independent magazine about nature and regeneration powered by the California Academy of Sciences.Lead image: Peterson, B.

A group of researchers in Taiwan and Australia believe zinc oxide holds the key to the bendy devices of the future. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The team used the compound to build a wafer fit for technologies that benefit from flexibility, such as displays and wearable devices, because the silicon ones used in many electronic devices tend to be stiff. To create a zinc oxide wafer capable of wobbling, the researchers grew the compound on a surface made of the mineral muscovite, as they reported in a 2021 paper published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces. The new wafer enables electrons to quickly shuttle through it, a crucial property for high-speed tech, and endures plenty of bending in the lab.Credit: Ying-Hao Chu.But it took some trial and error to get the wafer just right. As seen here, some attempts to grow zinc oxide into a flat wafer instead created a series of spiky crystals in a stunning arrangement that resembles an otherworldly garden. The experiments also produced what resembles a rugged lakeshore—when it was cut, stress bent the muscovite surface. It wasn’t until years later that the image of this zinc oxide nanoflower-strewn crystal garden, which has been digitally enhanced to boost its hues, got its moment in the sun.

You’re actually looking at what might become a key component of the brain-like computers of the future—and one of the winners of the Department of Energy’s recent Art of Science Image Contest. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . “It was a cute surprise to see those eyeballs, two micrometers in diameter, staring back at me through the electron microscope,” materials scientist Donald Robinson of Sandia National Laboratories told Nautilus via email.This “Kermit head” is composed of a battery material called ruthenium hexacyanoruthenate Prussian blue analog (RuPBA). Robinson and his colleagues, led by materials scientist Alec Talin, turned RuPBA into a memory device that mimics a synapse, the structure that enables our neurons to communicate.This technology, called Electrochemical Random-Access Memory (ECRAM), can both store and crunch data—this cuts out the current need to shuttle information between memory and processing components, which could save time and energy as data centers proliferate around the world. ECRAM is capable of holding magnitudes more information than devices used in conventional computers by storing it within a spectrum of electrical conductivity, rather than the binary on-and-off states of our current transistors. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . In this image, our frog friend was created by growing RuPBA via chemical reaction on a silicon wafer covered with gold electrodes—but Kermit defied the plan and cropped up on a part of the wafer that was gold-free. As seen in the four squares, RuPBA can shift from white to blue, yellow, or green, depending on how it’s tweaked in the lab. In the future, Robinson and his co-authors write, such a device could make its way into a brain-computer interface—these futuristic systems are being developed to help people living with paralysis speak and move, among other feats.

It took six domestic flights for Israeli photographer Amit Eshel to get within striking distance, and then days of traveling by dogsled and snowmobile to make it to the northern part of the island. Eshel undertook the journey in hopes of spotting Ellesmere’s wolves, which have no known history of being hunted and are unafraid of the few human visitors they encounter. Yet only about 200 Arctic wolves (Canis lupus arctos) live on Ellesmere, which is roughly the size of Great Britain, and during Eshel’s first visit in April 2022, he and his Inuit guides searched for two weeks without finding them.

This time, 12 days into the expedition, his group was moving across a frozen fjord in -31 degrees Fahrenheit temperatures when they spotted a single wolf through binoculars. Eight more soon appeared, and the pack moved slowly toward Eshel. “I laid down holding my camera with a wide lens and they came over for a very close look,” he says. “At times they were so close they almost touched me, and I could smell their breath.”Eshel says he hopes the resulting composition imparts a sense of what it felt like to briefly be part of the pack. He also hopes it illustrates the playfulness of these oft-feared predators—particularly in a place where human persecution hasn’t compromised their natural curiosity.

    "content": "Civilizations rise and fall. The Maya civilization once stretched over tens of thousands of miles in Central America, and during its golden age—known as the Classic Period, which lasted more than 600 years—it was admired for its grand limestone cities, advanced commerce, and its rich cultures of writing and art. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . But the collection of linked city-states began to collapse at the end of the ninth century. For decades, historians and archaeologists have theorized that severe weather, and related famines, might have played a part. Now, scientists are finding confirmation in cave stalagmites, the ghostly rock spires that rise from the floor of some caverns due to the precipitation of calcium carbonate from the ceiling above. These stalagmites suggest that the empire’s undoing was indeed sown by a series of brutal droughts, including one that lasted 13 years.END OF AN ERA: The authors Daniel H. James, David Hodell, Ola Kwiecien, and Sebastian Breitenbach, from left to right, at the Maya site of Labna in the Puuc region of Yucatán, Mexico, which was most likely abandoned during the Terminal Classic Period, when the Mayan civilization began unraveling. Credit: Mark Brenner, 2022.“This period in Maya history has been a cause of fascination for centuries,” University of Cambridge paleoecologist Daniel H. James said in a statement. “There have been multiple theories as to what caused the collapse, such as changing trade routes, war, or severe drought, based on the archaeological evidence the Maya left behind,” said James, who conducted the research while a Ph.D. student at Cambridge’s Department of Earth Sciences. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . James and his colleagues found the stalagmites in a cave in the Yucatán peninsula, in southern Mexico, and measured the oxygen isotopes they contained. These chemical fingerprints helped them to determine rainfall conditions for individual wet and dry seasons during a period known as the Terminal Classic, when Maya culture was unraveling, its limestone cities abandoned and its cultural forces draining out.The empire’s undoing was indeed sown by a series of brutal droughts.The data the scientists collected suggest that the region suffered eight wet season droughts that lasted at least three years, with the longest drought stretching more than a dozen years. (For comparison, the Dust Bowl drought that plagued the Central Plains of the United States in the 1930s and coincided with the Great Depression, lasted a decade.) The results were reported in the journal Science Advances.Earlier research into the severity of droughts had looked at the oxygen isotopes found in lake beds, but this kind of data does not provide enough information to assess conditions within a given year. “Lake sediment is great when you want to look at the big picture, but stalagmites allow us to access the fine-grained detail that we’ve been missing,” said James, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at University College London.

    "content": "Long before Rick Thoman became a climate scientist—before the late-night calls with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration offices around Alaska and the long discussions with local tribal councils—he was just a boy in Pennsylvania who loved when it snowed. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Every morning in grade school, Thoman would carefully log temperatures from the thermometer outside his window, plotting it on graph paper and meticulously taping the sheets to his wall. Eventually, the chain snaked around the room, tracing his growing obsession with tracking the natural world.That early habit became the foundation for a lifelong pursuit: Thoman has spent the past three decades translating complicated climate science for communities facing an increasingly unpredictable world.At his office at NOAA’s Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, where he is a climate specialist, Thoman’s regularly peppered with questions from rural hunters asking about thin sea ice and pilots trying to plan fuel deliveries around erratic freeze-ups. In a state where climate change already disrupts daily life, he’s been a link between science and the people it affects. Now, Trump administration cuts are threatening not just his job, but the essential tools that help him provide globally important data. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . “We could wake up the next day, the hurricane could be right next to the coast.”Since taking office in 2025, President Trump has rapidly dismantled climate science, undermining domestic research and international collaborations. In the process, services as basic as weather and storm forecasting are suffering. Scientists warn that the administration’s series of drastic cuts and political manipulation of federal funding and data will stall critical research, hinder disaster preparation and response, and damage the United States’ global standing—spilling beyond science.In accordance with Project 2025 recommendations, this spring the President’s budget proposed reducing NOAA’s funding by $1.7 billion, calling for steep cuts to its operations, research, and staff. That cut, much of which is still on the table, could eliminate whole programs that conduct vital weather, ocean, coastal, and climate research, weakening forecasts and making it harder to prepare for disasters. The administration has also called for ending numerous satellite, ocean, and coastal monitoring initiatives, and taking down other key weather and climate infrastructure, including models that help forecast hurricanes or track ocean acidification.For Thoman, a grim uncertainty has hung over each morning as he braced for word that NOAA funding for the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy was cut. Any time his phone buzzed, it could spell the end of his being able to provide crucial, daily-life information from datasets that have taken decades to build. “Every day you open your email like, Is today the day?” he says. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The list of climate and science programs that have been cut or are on the chopping block continues to grow, a grim roll call the Union of Concerned Scientists calls “a wholesale attack on the democratic systems upon which this nation was built.” Since Trump’s inauguration this year, the group has documented 402 cases in which government officials have censored, distorted, or eliminated federally-funded scientific work. This includes critical Environmental Protection Agency climate and energy research, Department of Interior funding for energy and development programs and wildfire suppression, Department of State’s climate investment programs, key NASA satellites used for climate modeling, and a U.S. Geological Survey program that studies how key ecosystems are changing.“We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion,” EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in an official statement describing the agency’s rollbacks. After a recent climate report bent the science so clumsily that its own sources spoke out, federal agencies are losing credibility. Staff at the NSF, NASA, and the EPA have all now signed public statements protesting the administration’s changes. Many of them have since been placed on leave.The implications tumble far beyond the U.S.’s borders. Thoman explains that in May, the Trump administration announced it would end NOAA services that monitor Arctic sea ice and snow cover. While other nations also collect ice data, it’s far less specific than NOAA’s for many areas, including Alaskan waters. Any ships navigating the Northwest Passage, for example, which is increasingly eyed for faster shipping routes for all kinds of goods, count on ice information from this program. Over the next two months, NOAA and the Department of Defense went on to announce three different dates for when the sea ice program would be terminated. (It was only rescued when the National Snow and Ice Data Center—run out of the University of Colorado, Boulder—was able to pivot to using data from a Japanese satellite.) The back-and-forth changes, Thoman says, were a “fiasco” that left the climate community worried about major gaps that might undercut climate models’ accuracy.FEWER EYES IN THE SKIES: Proposed cuts from the administration would eliminate numerous satellite missions, including Department of Defense data to help better understand hurricane dynamics and NASA data for climate modeling.

ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Thousands of miles away, James Potemra, an oceanographer at the University of Hawaii, sees how the U.S. stepping back from data collection will put people in that region—and around the world—at risk.The biggest climate concerns for many Pacific islands are extreme weather, especially storm surge affecting low-lying coastlines, and threats to coral reefs from ocean warming that endanger tourism. Because freshwater can be scarce, communities also rely on seasonal forecasts to prepare for dry periods and manage limited water resources. Much of this information previously came from U.S. National Weather Service offices in Honolulu and Guam, which, as in many places, have been downsized this year.Other satellite data crucial for understanding the internal structures of hurricanes, previously provided by the Department of Defense, are also at risk of vanishing. Marc Alessi, a fellow at the Union of Concerned Scientists, says this data is very important for identifying when a hurricane might undergo rapid intensification. Without it, he says, “we could wake up the next day, the hurricane could be right next to the coast, and no one would have known how strong it became overnight.”Most Americans check the weather without knowing that nearly every forecast they see—whether on their phone or on TV—comes from publicly funded NOAA data. Behind those daily predictions are government scientists, experts who’ve devoted their careers to translating the atmosphere’s chaos into something we can plan around. Since January 2025, approximately 2,200 of them have lost their jobs, and many more have taken early retirement offers. Altogether, NOAA has lost about 10 percent of the agency’s workforce. “One of the big, big impacts,” Thoman says, “is something that’s still intangible: The loss of many people with long experience.” ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The effects are already rippling across Alaska. Two of the state’s three National Weather Service forecast offices are now noticeably understaffed. For the first time since 1974, no one is on duty during the midnight shift in Fairbanks. “All the overnight forecasts are now coming out of Anchorage,” some 350 miles away, Thoman explains. Since the area has such varied topography, understanding local weather requires deep, location-specific expertise. “But Anchorage didn’t get new staff. And nobody there has meaningful experience forecasting northern Alaska.”The result, he says bluntly, is what you’d expect: Less accurate forecasts in a region where precise weather information can be a matter of life and death. “The loss of expertise within NOAA is going to have ramifications far and beyond” the meteorologists who’ve just lost their jobs, he says. “It’s emergency managers, it’s anybody that has relied on briefings from the Weather Service”—meaning anyone who wants to know the next time it’s going to rain. And that institutional knowledge? “That’s gone. And that loss of expertise is not coming back.”For the first time since 1974, no one is on duty during the midnight shift in Fairbanks.The instability has already taken a toll. Scientists like Sarah Cooley, who once led NOAA’s ocean acidification research, have been caught in a bureaucratic whiplash—fired, reinstated following a court ruling, then fired again after the injunction was overturned. “Who’s going to want to go work for NOAA now?” asks Potemra. Teaching climate science at the University of Hawaii last semester, he watched students wrestle with an impossible question: Should they stick with a career in climate research, or pivot to a less volatile area, as climate science becomes politically targeted? ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . This uncertainty also impacts the relationships that make international collaborations possible. Potemra has been working with communities in the island archipelago country of Palau to gather data and track climate indicators. This information can help people plan for and work around altered weather, such as consecutive dry days for taro farmers. This spring, he was notified that the three-year project he’d been leading through the University of Hawaii, in collaboration with a project funded by the United Nations Green Climate Fund, had been abruptly canceled. “Unfortunately we just got through compiling what would be needed and useful,” he says.Not being able to complete the project damages the trust Potemra has built with local communities, who are generally wary of outside researchers arriving with promises and then vanishing. “Frustration number one is not being able to follow through,” Potemra says, adding that he fears the project’s termination reinforces long-standing skepticism rooted in a history of extractive science.WEATHER—OR NOT: The daily ritual of checking the weather forecast has long been made possible by publicly funded NOAA data and analysis. Drastic cuts to the agency are threatening the quality of these reports—which are fed into phone apps and live reports across the country. Credit: Tasnuva Elahi, with image by Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.Scientific work often doubles as a form of diplomacy, helping build international connections and trust that can make research—and even business ventures or national security—easier. Potemra, for example, has occasionally been able to smooth over Navy relationships in the vast region, helping facilitate various Department of Defense projects. Losing or damaging these relationships weakens the United States’ global ties and reputation. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . That’s especially true as weather and climate scientists rely heavily on international data-sharing networks—and NOAA historically has been among the most significant contributors. Other countries, such as India, for example, depend on NOAA’s global datasets to strengthen and refine their own weather forecasting systems. And one of the best global records of climate change comes from the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii, which has measured carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for 67 years. It, and three other key observatories, are slated to be cut, Potemra notes.Other monitoring has been scaled back too, as many weather balloons have been grounded. In the northwestern Alaskan town of Kotzebue, Thoman says, balloon launches have been “indefinitely suspended” due to staffing shortages caused by budget cuts, and many other locations around the state have reduced their operations by half. Missing these upper-air observations doesn’t just affect local forecasts in Alaska, Thoman says. “It affects every model ingesting that data in the world, everywhere.” Because the atmosphere is always in motion, the sudden lack of balloons in western Alaska “could translate to a bad forecast in Nebraska in five days.” While the impact may be subtle at first, over time, it will also limit how well climate models can assess changes and anticipate tipping points. Severe weather is not waiting for federal chaos to calm. As hurricane season progresses, NOAA is reckoning with the damage caused by months of internal upheaval, scrambling to rehire staff for “mission-critical field positions” to meet minimum staffing levels.The stakes will be measured in the mounting toll of disasters we failed to predict, plan for, or prevent. This year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has lost more than a third of its staff, along with core programs like the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, and other mitigation grants that previously helped strengthen infrastructure before disasters strike. After FEMA administrator Cameron Hamilton was abruptly fired for testifying against the proposed shutdown of FEMA in May, his replacement, acting director David Richardson stunned staff by saying he didn’t know the U.S. had a hurricane season. The comment came during a June staff meeting, deepening concerns about the agency’s leadership. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Less than a month later, during flash floods in Texas that killed more than 135 people, the National Weather Service’s San Antonio office was missing the staff member who usually coordinates community response, thanks to the Trump administration’s buy-outs. “It’s a tragic example of the ‘last mile problem,’” Thoman says. FEMA’s response was delayed for days by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s cost control measures requiring her personal approval of expenditures.STORMS AHEAD: But we may not know it. With federal cuts to ocean monitoring systems, the ability to keep tabs on impending storms and trends will recede. That might not concern FEMA’s acting director David Richardson, though. He recently told staff he didn’t know that the U.S. has a hurricane season. Credit: Tasnuva Elahi, with image by EngineerPhotos / Shutterstock.With funding stripped, state and local governments are left scrambling to fill gaps in disaster preparedness and recovery. Former NOAA scientists warn that the loss of flash-flood modeling tools, such as those developed by the National Severe Storms Laboratory, which was recently shut down, will limit the ability to anticipate rapidly developing storms like the one in Texas. And cuts seemingly unrelated to weather are compounding the problem. For example, there is one radio station serving the entire northwest Arctic, where there is frequently no phone or internet service. Since Congress cut NPR funding, the station is now slated to close. If it does, Thoman says, “when you’re out hunting or at fish camp, you’ll be left with nothing but the sky itself to tell you what’s coming.”Even as disasters surge, the Trump administration is undermining federal investment in the science and systems that could help prevent or mitigate these losses. That’s incredibly expensive: A recent analysis by Bloomberg Intelligence found that over the past year, the U.S. has spent approximately $1 trillion on disaster recovery and other climate-related expenses—far exceeding earlier forecasts. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Although the price of survival is climbing, for now Thoman is counting his blessings. In July, he heard that the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy had been given a temporary reprieve: Their funding from the annual budget passed under the Biden administration was granted through August of 2026. There’s broad bipartisan Congressional opposition to the President’s proposal to further cut NOAA’s services, but what might happen next is still up in the air. “It’s better than the alternative,” Thoman says, but “we’ve seen lots of unilateral decisions by agency heads, and the courts have given the blessing to dismantle stuff in spite of Congressional approval.”For the moment, Thoman plans to return to the basics—asking not just how to fund his work, but why it matters and who it’s for.Those questions first crystallized for him during his early days as a weather forecaster in Nome, a small town in Northwest Alaska. “I quickly learned that a ‘nice’ day didn’t hinge on temperature or wind speed. If the sun was shining, it was a good day,” he recalled on a University of Alaska Fairbanks podcast.That simple reality stuck with him not just because it reflected a different relationship with the environment, but also because it taught him to focus on what matters to the people actually living with the weather. It was about how conditions felt on the ground, and what made life easier or harder for those experiencing it firsthand. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now .

    "content": "We have long regarded humans as the most rational of animals. But as polymath Bertrand Russell noted, we spend our lives looking for evidence of that claim and find little. On the contrary, we find far more convincing evidence of our tendency toward self-deception. We blame others for our mistakes, rationalize after the fact, and make impulsive choices even when patience would yield better rewards. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Some behavioral imperfections appear uniquely human. One is what the evolutionist Bill Hamilton referred to as the nonadaptive strategy of malevolence: harming others with no form of benefit for oneself. Or, in other words, a version of economic historian Carlo M. Cipolla’s third fundamental law of human stupidity, which goes like this: A stupid person is someone who causes losses to others while he receives no advantage and may even experience losses. After all, only humans insult strangers online or back incompetent leaders out of blind loyalty. Much of the damage we do isn’t criminal, but born of sloppiness, ignorance, and sloth.Though we behave like know-it-alls, we are easily manipulated and taken in by charlatans of all kinds. We prefer a product that is 80 percent lean to one that is 20 percent fat, and an unnecessary item that costs $9.99 seems cheaper than one that costs $10. We are willing to get into our cars, stand in lines for hours, and squish into horrendous shopping centers to save a pittance on a special offer for snacks dripping with sugar and fat.Homo sapiens is brilliant in calculation yet profoundly limited in foresight. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . All of these behaviors illustrate our evolutionary inertia. We are descended from animals that had to make fast decisions—about food, threats, and reproduction. There was no time for deliberation; quick but flawed judgment meant survival. Thus, irrationality, or at least a limited and pragmatic rationality, has made it possible for us to survive (which does not implicitly mean that it is justified today). This compromise between speed and accuracy generates a cascade of imperfections and snap judgments.As psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer argues, from our evolutionary past, we have inherited an adaptive, contextual form of reasoning that is neither logical nor probabilistic, but good enough to keep us alive. We’re wired to scan for threats, anticipate others’ behavior, and infer meaning, even when none exists. This explains why we tend to attribute cause-and-effect relationships between totally unrelated phenomena, such as stepping under a ladder and failing an exam, and draw broad conclusions from anecdotes. A great deal of the data from developmental psychology, anthropology, and neuroscience confirms that, for adaptive reasons that no longer exist, our minds have evolved a strong tendency to distinguish between inert entities, such as physical objects, and entities of a psychological nature, like animate agents.We thus are dualists and animists by nature. As a result, we attribute purposes and intentions to things, even when none exist, and imagine hidden motives and conspiracies where there are none. For us, stories always have a purpose, which can be evident or hidden.We are, in short, belief machines, and we manufacture a lot of those beliefs. And when belief comforts us or helps us make sense of a chaotic world, we cling to it, no matter how irrational. We’re even willing to endure ridicule, as in the case of flat-earthers who set out on a cruise to reach the ends of the Earth. They never reached it, but afterward, many found ways to explain why. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . A clear sign of our brain’s flaws is that we often make mistakes even when we know we’re making them. We know perfectly well that we are wrong—or at least, we have all the intellectual and factual tools to understand—but we do it anyway, because admitting it would force us to change. This isn’t just about emotions overruling reason, as they have since the dawn of time. That’s only part of the story.When we should use our head, we often react instinctively.There is a deeper evolutionary logic that explains the countless manifestations of human irrationality. Insincerity, the narcissism of gurus, and obscurantism may aggravate it, but they don’t explain it. At the core is a paradoxical defect—an imperfection that helped us survive. Research shows that our brains process thoughts and decisions using two distinct, though interconnected, systems.Put simply, the first system is old in evolutionary terms and governs quick, automatic responses—whether in routine or emergency situations—and is primarily connected to the amygdala, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. The second system, primarily connected to the prefrontal cortex, is a relatively recent evolutionary development. It governs our most deliberate actions, those that result from careful and slow evaluation of contextual information. We could call it the logical reasoning system, as it handles the careful analysis of concepts, generalizations, principles, and abstractions. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Neither system is necessarily more rational or emotional than the other. Both have played a fundamental role in our evolution: first, by providing us with instantaneous evaluations based on experience, which is preferable when the decision has to be taken immediately or is based on a large number of different variables; and second, by offering us the wonders of science and any choice based on reasoned arguments, especially when we are faced with a new problem. We should not consider one to be irrational and the other rational, because reacting instinctively in certain situations is often the most rational choice. At the same time, however, both can cause us to make enormous mistakes because our actions are frequently generated from an improvised middle ground between the two systems.In fact, neither has definitive control over the other, and the mutual interferences between intuitions and reflections are about as imperfect as it is possible to imagine for a self-proclaimed “sapiens” mammal. One tries to control the other, while the other tries to condition it. The deliberative system is, in any case, based on data provided by the reflex system, which is not always reliable. When we are greatly fatigued or overloaded with work and stress, we need to count on its reliability, but instead, it gets bogged down in thousands of cumbersome procedures and misfires, and we can be easily manipulated by those who can cleverly exploit the weaknesses of the reflex system. In other words, when we should use our head, we often react instinctively, and vice versa.So we must look for perfection elsewhere, perhaps in our “superior” human faculties. What about our memory? Unfortunately, it too is good at spotting patterns, but is short, selective, and unreliable. We reinterpret, misplace, and forget details, especially online, where repeated exposure to a claim makes it feel true. This makes us vulnerable to misinformation and ensures we repeat both personal and collective mistakes.This is why the decisions we are making today, whose consequences will affect future generations, are unfortunately not a gift left to us by nature. We have to learn to make decisions through education and culture. Evolution favors the present moment, as survival once depended on seizing immediate opportunities. As a result, we lack true foresight—something many recognize when, for example, they delay starting a diet despite knowing they should. ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Homo sapiens is brilliant in calculation, curiosity, and technological innovation, yet profoundly limited in foresight, reasoning, and social judgment. At our core remains that imperfection that Holocaust survivor and writer Primo Levi saw nesting in human nature. People are not beasts, wrote Levi in The Drowned and the Saved; they become so in certain conditions and contexts that reduce them to following their basic instincts. We inherit a dual nature, where culture and experience guide us toward better or worse outcomes, underscoring the need for constant ethical vigilance.Levi saw technical and narrative invention as forms of tinkering, building on existing materials and constraints, just like evolution itself. For Levi, humanity is capable of both sublime achievement and unimaginable horror. In his appendix to If This Is a Man, he writes that the extermination camps are nonhuman, even counter-human inventions. But there can be no return to Arcadia; we must forge ahead as our own blacksmiths. The only true antidote to falling back into “inhumanism,” according to Levi, is critical and self-critical rationalism. Not a perfect logic, but a skeptical and methodical approach, whose first lesson is simple: Distrust all the prophets that manipulate the imperfections of the human mind.

A global treaty to address that crisis is long overdue. A United Nations committee has been trying to hash out the details of an agreement that would limit the production of new plastics and minimize plastics’ harmful effects since 2022. Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . The committee’s goal was to finalize such an international treaty last year, but negotiations have stalled, with multiple oil-producing countries—including Russia, India, and Saudi Arabia—rejecting proposals to limit plastic production, among other roadblocks. With a 2024 goal for a finalized treaty come and gone, delegates from more than 170 countries, along with representatives from advocacy groups, plastics industry organizations, and others, have been gathered in Geneva, Switzerland, since last week to give finalizing the treaty one last shot.The outlook is not particularly good. Late last month, Trump administration officials sent a memo to several countries urging them to reject provisions aimed at capping the production of virgin plastic and the addition of certain chemicals to plastics before the Geneva talks even commenced. But the United States government isn’t the only one sending around letters trying to influence the shape of this sweeping plastics treaty. Religious leaders from around the world have also weighed in, stating their desire to see some form of a constructive solution to the mounting plastic crisis. The letters were obtained recently by Nautilus.The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, sent a message dated July 28 that relayed his hopeful but pragmatic approach. “It is impractical to expect the total elimination of plastics production because many plastic-based products are essential for the health and well-being of living beings,” the head of Tibetan Buddhism wrote. “However, the thoughtless usage of plastic needs to be curtailed.” The Dalai Lama urged the delegates to “act wisely,” and put together a treaty that “protects the health of all living beings, safeguards human rights, and preserves our small blue planet, our only home.” ADVERTISEMENT Nautilus Members enjoy an ad-free experience. Log in or Join now . Bartholomew I of Constantinople, the leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church, echoed the Dalai Lama’s sentiments, with a special emphasis on the most vulnerable. “Through our insensitive attitudes and careless actions, we have created far more plastics and single-use goods than we need or can possibly manage,” he wrote. “We now know that plastic waste not only pollutes mountains, forests, cities, and oceans, but that it harms the most vulnerable among us by breaking down into minute particles that enter and pollute the bodies of every living creature,” he wrote in a letter to the UN committee.Batholomew urged that solving this problem will require a dramatic change in attitudes about the relationship between Earth’s creatures. “It is our fervent hope and prayer that we will drastically convert our worldview and ways, recognizing that we are all interrelated as human beings and with the rest of creation.”The Vatican weighed in as well. Joachim von Braun, president of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, reiterated the need to change humanity’s relationship with plastic. The crisis requires a “holistic approach—one rooted in a profound ethic of care for our common home, not merely marginal adjustments,” he wrote in an August 1 letter. “The treaty must be science-based and include actionable recommendations that address both the chemical and particulate aspects of plastics throughout their life cycle.”Hopefully an agreement will come out of Geneva this week that will help humanity emerge from decades of dependence on plastic products and will protect our own health and the blue ball we call home.
